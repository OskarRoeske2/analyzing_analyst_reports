However, the presentation and Q&A reinforced our view that GM has potential to unlock significant value by creating a spinco for GM’s B2B modular EV skateboard business (see “General Motors: A stock for every purse and purpose” 9/10/20). Indeed, Mary noted that GM is looking for additional EV skateboard customers beyond the two recent companies that GM has inked deals with (Nikola and Honda). Moreover, we think that our ‘skateboard’ company idea would meet many of the criteria that Mary outlined as important to GM’s EV efforts. We continue to see GM’s EV skateboard business worth $14-25 per GM share, and see a partial spin of the skateboard company preferable to a retail EV car company or tracking stock, and reiterate our $39 price target and OW rating, and our upside case value (based on sum-of-the-parts) of $74. Recap of EV Skateboard Spinout Opportunity Creating a spinco for a B2B skateboard business could unlock significant value. In the 1920s, GM eclipsed Ford through a strategy of “a car for every purse and purpose” (from Chevrolet up to Cadillac). Today, GM stock lacks appeal for growth investors, despite its EV and AV efforts. So just as former CEO Alfred Sloan had created different models for different buyer groups, we argue that GM should consider a separate EV skateboard business (as well as Cruise) that could unlock some of the inherent value. GM has a robust EV pipeline underscored by an EV skateboard that has already attracted two customers. Building on its long history in the EV market, between now and 2025 GM plans to launch dedicated BEVs in both the US and China (15 models in each market). These will be underpinned by its Ultium battery and modular EV platform. Nikola and Honda have already inked deals with GM to develop vehicles based on this modular platform. Skateboard company partial spin preferable to a retail EV car company or tracking stock, in our view; could be worth $14-$25 per GM share. Creating a B2C EV company would face several branding, dealer and union barriers, leading us to prefer a B2B skateboard company that would serve GM and other OEMs (legacy and startups, like Honda and Nikola). Assuming sales multiples of 5-7x, and/or EV/EBITDA multiples of 25-25x, on 2025 revenue and EBTIDA would imply EV of $25-$47bn, or $14-$25 per GM share (assuming 75% ownership). How the skateboard opportunity could meet CEO Barra’s strategic tests Perhaps in an attempt to tap down arguments that GM should separate all of its EV business (that is B2C retail brands), CEO Barra set out several strategic factors. Specifically, Mrs. Barra noted that GM:', '· Wants to “avoid any scenario where those competencies are compromised”', 'We would argue that our skateboard idea would meet these goals, while a ‘retail’ EV company spin would not. Skateboard company would not be just a short-term pop – but would access lower cost capital and create a long-term supplier company . By creating an EV skateboard company and spin, we do think that some of the value gap in GM shares would close. But more importantly, a partial offering could raise lower-cost capital from strategic OEM investors as well as private investors and perhaps the public for the EV R&D and Capex. Moreover, it would allow core GM to release more of the cash flow from light truck to value-oriented investors and shareholders. And even if the high market multiples for EV companies cool off, nevertheless a “skateboard co” would likely trade (at worst) at the top end of the supplier range (think high-teens P/E for e.g., APTV) vs. the single digit OEM multiples. Skateboard company would not compromise the core auto company. GM is likely reluctant to spin out its consumer-facing EV operations because in an ‘all electric’ future, EVs will be the only vehicles in the showroom, and removing the ability of ‘legacy’ Chevrolet to pivot to EVs would doom legacy Chevrolet to a dim future (as in buggy whips). However, by sourcing skateboards from a quasi-independent skateboard company, GM could continue to shift its legacy brands to EVs. Moreover, if skeptics are right and consumers only want EVs from new companies without an internal combustion engine (ICE) history, GM shareholders would benefit from skateboard co sales to those OEMs (or even at some point create its own consumer facing brand). Skateboard company would likely enhance speed to market. Just as Cruise allowed GM to create a new structure to accelerate AV efforts, and its Delphi parts division in the 1990s operated at a faster ‘cycle time’ than core GM, a new co on skateboards would focus engineering efforts (and compensation) in a way that could enhance speed to market.']",39.00,overweight
