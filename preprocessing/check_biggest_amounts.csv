5986,468,9,"Transforming from a hardware company to a services company faster than investors had expected, which isdriving financial and valuation upside Apple hashistorically been regarded as an IT Hardware company tied to a short product refresh cycle of the iPhone in an extremely competitive smartphone industry. More recently, investors have been proved wrong on the pace of Apples transformation to a services company, with revenues in the Services reporting segment increasing from 8% of total in FY12to an estimated 20% of total in FY21E. The Services opportunity is currently derived primarily from App Store purchases and there are multiple emerging drivers, such asApple Music and Apple Pay, which should continue to drive strong growth. We forecast 23% revenue CAGR for Services including comfortably hitting the FY20E Services revenuetargetof $48bn with modestly better than company-wide margins to be accretive to profit growth, and accompanied by higher visibility to revenue and earnings, which we believe warrants a higher earnings multiple relative to the core hardware business."

We expect Apples subscription-based Music service to reach 100mnMAUs by FY20E through increasing penetration of a target market estimated by J.P. Morgan Internet analyst, Doug Anmuth , to total 2.7bnusers,thusremaining the second largestmusic streamingservice globally after Spotify. We forecastannual revenuesto grow at a 41% CAGR to$16bnby FY21E. Separately, Apple Pay is gaining traction with the installed base and already leads competitive product offerings on Samsung or other Android platforms. We forecast $2.2bnin revenues from Apple Pay by FY21E with a 48% CAGR,led by the broader industry trend of strong growth in use of mobile payments and increase in NFC-enabled merchants."

We expect Apple to ramp up its investments in video content steadily starting with $1bnin 2018. We expect a steady increase in investments in video content, given Apples focus on differentiation through content rather than encouragement ofcord-cutting. However, the level of investments is unlikely to reach Netflixs $8bnand Amazons $5bnover our forecast window FY21E. We expect Apple to combine the video and print media offering through acquisition of Texture to offer a packaged subscription at $14.99month relative to $9.99 for Apple Music anddrive Apple Music subscribers to upgrade to the packaged subscription, while at the same time growing the subscriber base at a rapid pace.

5991,468,14,"Pricing power, driven in part by differentiation on technology, will continue to surprise investors on the upside Investors have been pleasantly surprised by the limited price elasticity exhibited by customers, which includes the increase in iPhone volumes despite a 3% pricing CAGR over the last tenyears and a higher increase in retail price in certain countries due to roll-off of carrier subsidies. Consumers have been willing to pay higher ASPs, due to a combination of: 1 stickiness of the iOS platform including smartphonesand accessories like watches through technology differentiation 2 increasing use of financing to pay in installmentsand3 push-out of spend on laptops and tablets. Our analysis reveals that Apple has an exceptional track record of success with the top-of-the-line smartphone marketed each year and with larger screen size smartphones generally priced at a premium, relative toApplesprimary competitor in the high-end smartphone category, Samsung. The latest generation of iPhones launched on September 12, with base prices ranging from $1,099 at the high-end to $749 at the low-end,is set to continue to drive ASPshigher."
5992,468,15,"Apple to drive differentiation of the ecosystem through technology leadership Apples portfolio strategy of focusing on design of three iPhone models each year allows it more bandwidth for resources to drive technology leadership and quality assurance, which are crucial in maintaining price premium over competitive products and driving a longer life-cycle of the product which supports installed base growth. Apple is already comfortably ahead of competition in relation tofacial recognition modules. JPM Asia Technology analyst, Narci Chang , expects world facing 3D Sensing to be adopted on iPhones starting in 2019 see report, again comfortably ahead of competition. Similarly, optimism around foldable smartphones has increased in recent months we expect Apple to be a fast follower with adoption starting in 2021 see report if it finds theform factor gaining traction with customers. Apples technology leadership drives both new customers joining the iOS installed base an estimatedone-third of annual demand and replacement demand led by upgrades from existing customers roughly two-thirds."
5993,468,16,"Acceleration in revenue growth to be a catalyst for investor sentiment buybacks to boost earnings growth further We expect a 10% revenue CAGR between FY17 and FY21, accelerating from the 8% CAGR over the last fiveyears, led by a combination of high-single-digit revenue growth in iPhones and double-digit revenue growth in Services and Other Products revenues. The acceleration in revenue growth should drive investor attention to the change in the drivers of revenue growth from being primarily led by iPhone revenues historically, to a balance between iPhone, Services, and Other Product revenues over our forecast window. We expect the 10% revenue CAGR to translate into a 17% earnings CAGR over the forecast window FY21E, through deployment of capital in share buybacks on a continual basis."
5994,468,17,"Enormous capital deployment opportunity provides optionality The firms target of being net cash neutral in the long-run relative to the net cash position of $129bnat end of F3Q18 and strong free cash flow generated annually average of $54bnannually over last fiveyears provides an enormous opportunity for capital deployment. However, we believe medium-term upside to our base case estimates based on buybacks largely in line with free cash flow is likely from large buybacks or acquisitions. For example, we estimate annual buybacks of $100bncan help Apple can reach close to a cash neutral position by FY21E, with accretion of $2.25 to our FY21E EPS. On the downside, however, our base case forecasts embed largelyflat operating margins, and we estimate the proposed tariffs,if implemented,could be a modest headwind of 50bpson operating margins medium- term and moderate our earnings growth forecasts."
5995,468,18,"Expect MA to focus on Services opportunities and large installed base Video Gaming, Automotive,and Smart Speakers could be potential opportunities While Apple has historically acquired hardware companies, it has largely been to bring certain technologies in-house and have the ability to further develop them. We expect bolt-on acquisitions of hardware companies to continue as the firm continues to evaluate technology differentiation for future generation of products. However, recent acquisitions of Texture, and Shazam, are more typical of acquisitions we would expect Apple to focus on moving forward to further enhance the Services offering to its existing installed base. Additionally, we do not rule out Apple looking at other end-markets with a combination of a large installed base and associated opportunity to deploy services. We believemobile video gaming and the automotive end-market could be of interest in this regard, in addition to potential interest in the smart speaker end-market given lackluster performance of the HomePod todate."

In greater contrast, Apples $61bnin operating profit compares to $26bnfor Alphabet, $20bnfor Facebook, $4bnforAmazon, and $0.8bn for Netflix. Additionally, the firm has a historical track record of much stronger earnings growth than the SP 500 index,of which it is the largest constituent at 5% weight. However, AAPL shares still trade at 16.6x NTM PE, modestly below the market multiple and well below trading multiples of other technology leaders. We expect the combination of double-digit earnings growth and a trading multiple in line with the market to screen very attractively for both value and growth investors although AAPL ispart of only the SP 500 growth index."

However, with strong double-digit growth 18% CAGR over the last five years, Apple has more than doubled the FY12 revenue of $13bnby FY17 $30bn. We forecast a modestly stronger 23% CAGR through FY21E, including comfortably achieving its target of doubling the FY16 revenue of $24bnby FY20E JPMe $56bn. Growth will be drivenboth by increase in the installed base from 1.4bndevices in FY17 to 1.9bnby FY21E at a 7% CAGR, and an increase in service revenue per installed device at a 16% CAGR."

6005,468,28,"Media services, including original video, to be the next big driver for Apple News reports see link indicate that Apple is looking to invest around $1bninto original video programming initially to drive exclusive content and we expect investments to steadily ramp further over time. However, investments willremain lower than Netflixs $8bnand Amazons $5bnlevels through our forecast window FY21E,primarily as Apple is looking to add exclusive content to the media platform rather than position itself as an alternative to cable,Netflix or Amazon Prime. Additionally, we expect Apple to add print media subscriptions, building on the recent acquisition of Texture to further enhance the services offering. We believe Appleis likely to look to consolidate the media services by tying together existing Music services and original video and print media. We expect the Apple Media subscription to be priced at a premium to the existing Music subscription we assume pricing of $14.99 for individual subscriptions vs. $9.99 for Music and $19.99 for family subscriptions vs. $14.99 for Music. We also expect 35% of Apple Music subscribers to upgrade to the all-encompassing Media service by FY25E, and account for an incremental $3bnof revenue in FY25E."

In consumer surveys, Apple Pay has had stand-out feedback with materially better adoption withininstalled base of devices relative to other competing platforms on Android devices, including those of primary premium smartphone competitor, Samsung. We expect Apple Pay revenues to rise at a 38% CAGR through FY25 to $6bn."

The combination of Apples current three-fourths market share in the premium smartphone market and expectations for flat volumes for the handset and smartphone market have raised concerns relative to maturity of the smartphone market and Apples position in it, leading to limited opportunities for volume growth. We acknowledge the modest volume opportunity for iPhones, particularly when every generationof smartphones is accompanied by price increases, and forecast 1% volume CAGR through FY21E."
6008,468,31,"However, we believe investors are missing the forest for the trees: Installed base demonstrating robust growth feeding into strong Services growth While investors have been focused on iPhone volumes sold annually in the primary market, the driver fueling the transformation to Services has been the expansion in the installed base which has demonstrated double-digit growth to date. Going forward, growth in the installed base is likely to moderate to a high-single-digit pace, but still implying growth of roughly 100mnunits in the installed base of devices every year relative to flat volumes in the primary market. The high-single-digit expansion in the installed base is led by new consumers switching to the iOS platform, new subscribers, and a high portion of replacement units makingtheir way to the secondary market where we estimate iPhones have a 50% market share relative to 15%market share of the new smartphone market."

Despite the increase in prices, iPhone volumes have not shown any significant signs of decline and investors have been pleasantly surprised by the limited price elasticity exhibited by consumers. Banking on the limited price elasticity demonstrated by consumers, Apple pivotedto a more aggressive pricing strategy with the launch of the iPhone Xat a base price of $999 in 2017,which has put the firm on track for a high-teen percentage increase in pricing for FY18E.The latest generation of iPhones released on September 12 this year now has the top-end product with a base price $1,099 and the low-end product with a base price of $749, setting up the firm for another year of strong price increase, by our estimates."
6010,468,33,"Better track record of driving the premium pricing strategy relative to peers Our analysis shows Apple has a better track record relative to competition with driving consumer adoption of the top-end phone in its portfolio. For example,iPhone X has accounted for one-third of total iPhone shipments to date and Applestop-end iPhones accounted for 14%-38% of total shipments over the last sixquarters, which compared to a range of 3%-24% for Samsung. Similarly, Apple has a solid track record with larger screen size phones marketed popularly as Plus Size models with shipments of these premium models accounting for an increasing portion of total shipments, roughly in line with Samsungs track record with a much broader set of smartphone models offered in larger screen sizes."

Additionally, the firm has generated on average free cash flow of $54bnover the last fiveyears. Apple has not put a timeline to its net cash neutral target, but the availability ofupto $291bnor 30% of the market cap to deploy over FY19E-21E through a combination of dividends, share repurchases, and MA provides enormous option value to investors in terms of upside to earnings."
6014,468,37,"Embed increasedshare repurchases and dividend in our base case forecasts, partly drivingour above consensus forecast for FY20 and FY21 Apple has returned roughly $300bnof cash to shareholders since 2012 through the end of F3Q18,which is roughly 30% of its current market capital, and we expect there is another roughly $300bnto deploy over the next threeyears. While we dont expect Apple to reach its net cash neutral position by end of FY21E, we expect share buybacks to accelerate to a $75bnannual pace similar to 2018E rather than the slower pace of around $30-$35bnduring FY15-17in part driving our above consensus forecast for FY20E and FY21E. Additionally, we are modeling a steady increase in dividends from $2.40share in FY17 to $3.42share in FY21E, amounting to $42bnof dividends over the next three years."
6015,468,38,"Acceleration in share repurchases to drive 6% accretion to our already above consensus FY20 and FY21 earnings estimates Despite our above consensus modeled pace of buybacks in FY20 and FY21, we still expect Apple to have a net cash position of $60bnby end of FY21E and generating over $64bnof free cash annually. We see upside to our already above consensus forecasts if management decides to aggressively pursue their target foraneutral cash position. We estimate a pace of buybacks close to $100bnannually would drive the company to a cashneutral position by end of FY21E, and imply upside of $2.25 to our already above consensus FY21E EPS forecast."
6016,468,39,Balance between share purchase acceleration and MA is likely as Apple invests to build the Services platform and maintain leadership in technology We believe it is more realistic to assume a balance between an acceleration of share repurchases beyond what is already in our base case estimates and spend on acquisitions as the drivers of earnings upside relative to our estimates.
6017,468,40,"Apple has historically only engaged in bolt-on acquisitionsexpect focus to be on subscription-based service opportunities in the coming years Apple has a history of making multiple bolt-on acquisitions everyyear, whichhas largelybeen focused on bringing any hardware technologythatthe company expects to be crucial in driving competitive differentiationin-house and better managingits development towards commercialization. As shown in Table 1, a lot of applications in use on iPhones today can be associated with technology acquisitions in the past, for example,facial recognition using 3D sensing and speech recognition for Siri. However, as we look at the transformation of the business to Services at a rapid pace, we expect a greater bias towards acquiring subscription-based software businesses that can be integrated into the Services segment, and we believe the recent acquisitions of Shazam and Texture are typical examples of what investors should expect going forward."
6018,468,41,"Relative to transformational MA driving access to new end-markets, we expect criteria to include large installed base and services opportunity We believe with increasing focus on Services revenues, particularly in the form of subscriptions, Apples interest in entering new end-markets is likely to be evaluated based on the opportunity for Apple to offer services leveraging the iOS platform on a large installed base."
6019,468,42,"Video gaming companies: The video gaming industry generates about $125bnin revenues, including roughly one-third on smartphones, making it an attractive industry for smartphone manufacturers in terms of vertical integration, particularly given recent investments in augmented reality. Apples focus on services will be highly complemented by video games, which are taking time and monetization share from other forms of entertainment. JPM Media analyst, Alexia Quadrani , believes the increasing global reach, improving technology, shift to higher-margin digital revenues, and increasingly social environments are fueling greater player engagement and spending. Software game sales are becoming increasingly digital in the US 31% of total sales in 2010 to 74% in 2016 which is likely to coincide with the increasing computing capabilities and larger screen sizes on smartphones to drive consumer gaming habits increasingly to mobile devices. We see opportunity for smartphone-basedgaming to increase from current levels of one-third of gaming revenues to around 40% of the industry by 2020, led by a double-digit annual growth rate."
6020,468,43,"Automotive services: Numerous press reports have in the past indicated Apples interest in the automotive end-market, including developing an autonomous vehicle. We think Apples interest in the automotive end-market is reasonable given the large installed base roughly 1.4bnvehicles globally and the ability to deliver services to drivers and passengers. We see the automotive OEM business"
6021,468,44,"Though,we would not rule out acquisitions of:"
6022,468,45,"Apple has already developed the CarPlay software to get access to the automotive end-market, but we believe owning the complete infotainment product would allow Apple to deliver the same high-quality experience that it hasbeen able to offer consumers on other devices like the iPhone."
6023,468,46,"Smart Speakers: We acknowledge that Apple already has a HomePod product, which was first released in early 2018. Based on our discussion with the company, we believe Apple wants to position the HomePod as a high-quality speaker with some intelligence features, relative to: 1 Google Assistant, which is geared to intelligence leveraging the companys leadership in search functions and 2 Amazon Alexa, which is geared towards promoting Amazons portfolio of features, including driving purchases in the Amazon marketplace. We believe this leaves room for Apple to position another product with greater intelligence features and with a different form factor, potentially leveraging an acquisition similar to its purchase of Beats to enter the headphone category."
6024,468,47,"Apple has already disrupted the fitness-wearables market Apples launch of AppleWatch was relatively late when compared to early movers in the fitness-driven wearables market,including Garmin, Fitbit and Nike. However, despite being late to the market, Apple Watch managed to disrupt some of the existing players, particularly single-activity tracking devices, as wellasexpand the addressable market for the wearables market. While most early entrants into the wearables market were seen as functional products targeting the fitness enthusiast, we believe Apple managed to expand the addressable market with a utility product, which went beyond the niche segment of fitness enthusiasts."
6025,468,48,"Now set to addresshealth-wearablesmarket, further expanding the target demographic to drive higherpenetration We believe with the launch of features like heart rate monitoring and electro cardio grams ECGs inthe latest generation of Apple Watches Series 4, Apple is now making a bigger push into health-based wearables, expanding the target market beyond the typical age demographic interested in fitness wearables. For example,the target age demographicin the USnow includes an additional 136mnpeople in the age group of 50 years and above, relative to the existing target market of 182mnin the age group below 50 years for fitness-based wearables."

Boosted by an aggressive capital deployment program with repurchases totaling a forecasted $294bnfor FY18E-FY21E, we expect a 17% earnings CAGR leading to our above consensus EPS forecasts."

6029,468,52,"Apple shares have traded at a discount to the SP 500 multiple, despite stronger revenue and earnings growth We find it largely unwarranted that AAPL shares have traded at a modest discount to the average SP 500 multiple over the last few years despite a stronger historical track record in revenue and earnings growth, as well as stronger outlook. As shown in Figure 14, Apple shares still trade only roughly in line to at a modest discount to the SP 500, despite a stronger revenue outlook and earnings growth outlook relative to the average company in the SP 500."
6030,468,53,"Premium to recent year average multiple warranted on return to innovation We believe the recent year discount on Apples trading multiple relative to the SP 500 multiple has largely been driven by the perception that opportunities for innovative product launches into new markets have moderated since the large success of the iPhone. However, we believe Apple has now returned to demonstrating its innovation prowess, although now disrupting end-markets like wearables, health, and gaming, rather than disrupting existing hardware like it did with iPhones."
6031,468,54,"We believe a modest re-rating is warranted based on our SOTP analysis Wearrive at a blended multiple of 17.8x for the combination of Apples products and services we anticipate in our forecast and expect a modest re-rating from current NTM trading multiple of 16.6x, led by a 14.0x multiple on the iPhone in line with Nokias multiple during its leadership in feature phonesand 26.0x on Services in line with hardline and luxury goods retailers with similar loyalty-driven recurring purchases from customers."
6032,468,55,Should AAPL shares be valued in line with consumer staples?
6033,468,56,"It appears there has been an increasing narrative that AAPL should be evaluated in comparison to earnings multiples for consumer staples companies, such as Household and PersonalCare products with high degree of repeat purchases by consumers. We acknowledge the repeat purchase cycle for consumers in relation to the iPhone and Services group, which together currently account for 77% of total company revenues however,the iPad, Mac, and Other products have more unpredictable replacement cycles. In addition, while the average 21x PE multiple for Household and Personal Care HPC companies can be thought of as the high-end of potential re-ratingfor AAPL shares, we think investors should consider a discount to the average HPC multiple to account for the ability of consumers to push out smartphone purchases during a downturn in addition to trading down to less expensive variants, with only the latter likely for HPC products."
6034,468,57,"Comparison with other technology leaders is normaland we find Apple well positioned relative to balance of valuation multiple against earnings outlook Interestingly, with annual revenues of $230bn, Apple is ahead of other technology leaders, including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Netflix all covered by JPM Internet analyst Doug Anmuth . In greater contrast, Apples $61bnin operating profit compares to $26bnfor Alphabet, $20bnfor Facebook, $4bnforAmazon, and $0.8bn for Netflix, showcasing a much stronger track record of generating profits than other technology leaders. While revenue and earnings growth rates for AAPL are expected to be a little less than half of the group average of Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix, so is the earnings multiple of 16.0x relative to the group average of 42.2x. As a result,we find AAPL shares screening well forboth growth and value investors relative to techleaders when looking at earnings multiple for every point of earnings growth, with PEG ratio ex-cash of 0.8x relative to the group average of 1.0x."
6035,468,58,"Currently proposed tariffsonly impact accessories Apple recently sent a letter to the US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, detailing a list of products that will be impacted from the currently proposed $200bn of tariffs on imports from China. The list initially included products from the Other Products segment, which has total revenues of an estimated $26bn in FY19E, but was later updated to exclude Apple Watch which we estimate accountsfor almost half of the segment revenues. We estimate Other Products excluding Apple Watch has gross margins closer to 20%. iPhones are also currently outside the purview of the proposed tariffs."
6036,468,59,"We see limited impact as Apple is likely to take pricing to offset the pressures We believe it is relatively easier for Apple to raise prices on accessories relative to taking price increases on the iPhone. We expect relatively minimal price elasticity for accessory products and expect Apple to likely raise prices to cover entirely the tariffs. As shown in Table 7below, we expect the 25% tariff to translate into a price increase of 15% if Apple decides to pass the entire impact of the tariff to consumers."
6037,468,60,"Headwind of up to 50bps in the worst case if Apple decides not to raise prices As shown in Scenario 3in the table above, we estimate a headwind of up to 50 bps to total company margins if Apple decides to take a conservative approach to prices and absorb the impact, which in our view is unlikely given the even lower degree of price elasticity on accessories."
6038,468,61,"No tariff impact on iPhone currently however, we would not expect a change in sourcing strategy even with a 25% tariff Although the iPhone is not the purview of currently proposed tariffs, the greater risk to Apple would be from any potential developments relative to tariffs on the iPhone, which accounts for 60% of total company revenues. However, our analysis shows that even if a 25% tariff were to be imposed, it would still make economic sense for Apple to continue with the current manufacturing footprint relative to moving the assembly to the United States. Over the long-run, we would expect Apple to move assembly operations for the iPhone done by Pegatron, Honhai, and Wistron to other countries with relatively cheaper labor cost relative to the United States and not"
6039,468,62,"See labor cost still driving enough arbitrage to keep existing manufacturing footprint rather than move to the United States As shown inTable 8, we estimate moving the assembly operations to the United States for the iPhone X would increase the cost to Apple from $522 to $643 assuming only 50% of components are manufactured in China, relative to an estimated cost of $653 if Apple decided to pay a 25% tariff on the assembled product. In our view, the lack of any major advantage of moving assembly operations back to the United States limits the likelihood of any investment in the US as a consequence of the tariffs."
6040,468,63,"Price increase of 13% required to absorb impact of tariff As shown in Table 9, we estimate a price increase of around 13% would be required to absorb the impact of a 25% tariff, keeping margin dollars for all players in the supply chain constant."
6041,468,64,"Worst case headwinds of 300 bps to gross margins if Apple does not price for the tariff However, if Apple were to be willing to absorb all the tariff and not raise prices, we estimate a 300 bps headwind to margins."
6042,468,65,"Prices increases to cover part of the tariff impact more likely 10% retail price increase would mitigate gross margin headwind to less than 100 bps As shown in Table 11, if Apple were to take a 10% price increase on the iPhone citing punitive tariffs, it would reduce the estimated headwind from any potential tariffs to less than 100 bps on gross margin."
6043,468,66,"Innovation has enabled the company to drive a 8% revenue CAGR over the last five years Apples innovation in new and existing product categories, including smartphones, tablets, and watches has helped drive robust revenue growth for the firm over the last few years. Looking over the last five years, the firm has posted revenue CAGR of 8% between FY12 and FY17, although as shown in Figure 15, FY17 revenues are largely in line with FY15 revenues following a levelling out of the growth driver in the form of iPhone revenues. As shown in Figure 16, relative to the revenue growth of $73bnfrom FY12to FY17 for the firm, three-fourths has been driven by iPhones, and 20% by Services, with Mac and Other Products contributing a minority, while iPad has been a modest headwind."
6044,468,67,"We expect low-double-digit revenue growth, led by iPhone, Services, and Apple Watch As shown in Table 13, we believe the medium-term revenue growth for the company will track in the low-double-digit range, led by a combination of: 1 high-single-digit revenue growth in iPhones, largely driven through priceASP increases 2 double- digit revenue growth in Services, led by growth in both the installed base as well as revenueper unit from the installed base and 3 double-digit revenue growth in Other Products, the combination of which is likely to be partly offset bydeclinesin iPads andMac devices."
6045,468,68,"Despite similar growth expectations relative to history, the composition of growth is likely to be materially different Relative to the $73bnof revenue growth over the five-year period starting in FY12, we expect even greater revenue growth of $111bnover our four-year forecast window FY17-FY21E. However, as shown in the comparison in Figure 17and Figure 18, while iPhone sales accounted for three-fourths of the revenue growth in the last fiveyears, we expect the growth in the next fouryears to be more balanced, although iPhones will continueto be the leading contributor to growth. As shown in Figure 18, we expect growth drivers to shift to Services and Other Products accessories in addition to the growth in iPhone revenues."
6046,468,69,"Despite continued volume concerns from investors, we expect revenue growth, although now led by pricing As shown in Figure 19, we forecast growth in revenue from iPhone sales, despite heightened investor concerns around both volumes and pricing. However, we do expect growth in revenues from iPhone sales to moderate from 12% CAGR over the last fiveyears to 9% CAGR for FY17-FY21E."
6047,468,70,"However, mix of volume and ASP drivers for revenue growth to change relative to historical trends While we do expect continued revenue growth from iPhone sales, we expect the composition of growth drivers to be more heavily weighted to pricing relative to volumes. As shown in the comparison in Figure 20and Figure 21, we expect the drivers of revenue growth to shift from being weighted to volume growth in the last five years to being weighted to ASP growth over the next fouryears."
6048,468,71,"Services to be second largest revenue growth driver and to more than double FY16 revenues by FY20E We expect Services to turn out to be the second largest revenue growth driver for the company over the medium-term and expect it to comfortably meet the firms target of $48bnin revenues by FY20. As shown in Figure 22, we expect Services revenue growth to accelerate and rise at a 23% CAGR over our forecast window. Helped by the strong pace of growth, by our estimates, Services revenue should reach $56bnby FY20E, relative to Apples target of $48bn. The forecast growth in Services revenue is led by both growth in the installed base and rise in Services revenue per device in the installed base."
6049,468,72,"Installed base growth to outpace growth in new devices Services revenue allows Apple to leverage its installed base of devices with consumers relative to annual revenues from device sales being levered to new units sales and being more cyclical around success of certain product launches in certain years. As shown in Figure 23, we expect the installed base of all devices, estimated to be around 1.4bndevices at FY18E end, will continue to increase ata high-single- digit pace to 1.9bndevices by FY21E. However, we believe primary portion of Services revenues will be levered to the installed base of iPhone devices with customers being able to use the same subscription across all their devices. As shown in Figure 23, we estimate the installed base of iPhones including those with second owners will be roughly 1bndevices at the end of FY18E, progressing to 1.45bnat FY21E end, implying high-single-digitincreases. Net, we expect the high-single- digit pace of increase in the installed base to outpace the modest declinefor legacy devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Mac devices, positioning the Services group for stronger growth relative to new devices."
6050,468,73,"Also expect growth in revenue per installed base device, led by growth in Music, App Store, Apple Care, and Apple Pay penetration As shown inFigure 25, we expect a continuedstrong pace of increase in Services revenue per device in the installed base, from a variety of growth drivers including increasing penetration of Apple Music within the installed base, increase in adoption as well as revenue per transaction for Apple Pay, continued growth in App Store revenues from increasing pace of application activity by third-party developers, and penetration of Apple Care as the preferred support and repair coverage for new device sales relative to third-party coverage."
6051,468,74,"Other Products, including Apple Watch, to be third primary driver of medium- term revenue growth The Other Products segment comprises various products, primary among which is the Apple Watch. Additionally, Apple has seen good success with launch of accessory products like Airpods and with the acquisition of Beats. While we expect growth in revenues ofthe Other Products segment to be driven by multiple products, we believe the primary driver will be sales of Apple Watch, which is already the leading smart watch globally."
6052,468,75,"Gross margins have moderated on a combination of headwinds including memory costs and currency While Applesgross margins have improved substantially from the 29.0% in FY06, prior to the launch of the iPhone, they have been range bound around the 38%-40% level for the last three years. Additionally, as shown in Figure 27, gross margins in recent years are lower than the peak gross margin of 43.9% in FY12, led we believe by a combination of the following: 1 increase in memory costs 2 currency headwinds 3 increasing exposure to accessory sales at lower margins, partly offset by growth in Services revenue."
6053,468,76,"Expect gross margins to be range boundon increasing mix of Services revenue offset by increasing mix of lower margin accessory sales Table 14below shows our forecast for gross margin by product. We estimate iPhone sales, and Services to be accretive to corporate gross margins, while sales of iPad, Mac devices, and Other Products excluding the Apple Watch are dilutive to gross margins. Apple does not disclose margin by product."
6054,468,77,"Figure 28shows our gross margin forecasts, which we expect to remain largely range bound between 38% and 39%, on the confluence of tailwinds from increasing mix of Services revenues, which we estimateto be at higher-than-corporate margins and increasing mix for revenues from sales of accessory products excluding Apple Watch, which we estimate to be at lower margins relative to corporate margins."
6055,468,78,"Despite stable gross margins, we forecast moderation in operating margins with the company likely to prioritize growth in Services opportunities We expect to see a higher pace of investments from Apple towards driving the existing services revenue opportunities and create new opportunities. While there is ample headroom for growth in current Services opportunities, including growth in penetration of Apple Music and Apple Pay, we believe more investments are likely to drive original content in both Apple Musicand video content."
6056,468,79,"Earnings growth to accelerate led by capital deployment While we expect modest acceleration in revenue growth relative to the pace over the last fiveyears, we expect a stronger earnings acceleration led by an accelerated pace of share repurchases. As shown in Figure 30, we expect the pace of earnings growth to accelerate to a 17% CAGR for FY17-FY21E, relative to 8% earnings CAGR between FY12 and FY17."
6057,468,80,"Largest capital return program for any US company, pace of repurchases accelerated since tax reform After already returning $275bnof capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends since 2012, Apple announced a $100bnbuyback program in May of 2018. In addition to the$100bnbuyback program, Apple has an existing dividend through which Apple has already promised to return around $14bnannually, the combination of which makes it the largest capital return program for any US company. The pace of repurchases accelerated earlier this year on the back favorable tax reform. We expect Apple to buyback$74bnof stock in FY18E and $70bnof FY19E, to exhaust the $100bnprogram announced in mid-FY18, before accelerating to a pace of around $75bnannually. This compares to repurchases of $165bnbetween FY13 and FY17 fiveyears, at an average pace of $33bnyear."
6058,468,81,"Large repurchases are enabled by attractive free cash flow Apples large repurchase activity is facilitated by attractive free cash flow generation, which we currentlyforecast to be in the range of $65bn-$69bnannually in the coming years. As shown in Figure 32, despite a very large repurchase and dividend program, Apple has continued to add cash to the balance sheet helped by free cash flow exceeding the capital returns in most years."

6061,468,84,"We value Apple shares using a blended multiple, which values Apples various product segments at different multiples We believe a blended multiple is most appropriate for Apple, which as discussed is expected to see a shift in the composition of growth drivers from hardware sales to services sales. While growth in Services revenues isexpected to be one of the primary drivers of the revenue growth for the company through FY21, it still only accountsfor 20% of total company revenues by the end of our forecast window FY21. We expect the growth in Services revenue to drive accelerationin revenue growth for the total company beyond our forecast window, as it becomes a greater portion of total company revenues."

6065,468,88,"Services: PE multiple of 26.0x on the Services segment, in line with the average trading multiple for a peer group of luxuryretail companies Costco, Estée Lauder and Home Depot, which are leaders in their respective markets and derive a stickiness for product sales through customer loyalty either in the form of membership programs or brand value. We believe the subscription nature of ApplesServices segment, with high visibility of revenue and earnings, warrants it beingvalued in line with the leading luxuryretail companies. As shown in Table 15, the average NTM for the peer group is 26.6x."
6066,468,89,"Apple Watch: PE multiple of 25.0x, roughly in line with the 26.0x target multiple we use for the Services group, on account of the materially higher room for growth relative to Apples legacy hardware products like iPhone, iPad, and Mac."
6067,468,90,"Other Products: PE multipleof 16.0x, at a modest premium to the legacy hardware devices like iPhone, iPad, and Mac on account of higher growth opportunities. However, the 16.0x multiple is at a discount to the 25.0x multiple we use to value Apple Watch on account of lower margins for accessory sales in a more competitive market."

The significant increase means that roughly every fourth individual globally buys a mobile handset each year. Additionally, the installed base globally for mobile handsets is estimated to be roughly 7.4bn, which means that almost every individual globally owns one. The high penetrationandvolume opportunity makesit a very attractive market for new entrants."

As shown in Figure 45, roughly 512mnfeature phones are sold annually relative to 1.5bnsmartphones currently, making smartphones the primary segment within the mobile handset industry. This is relative to 90% of the total mobile handset industry comprising feature phones in 2007."
6089,468,112,"Samsung and Apple disrupted the mobile handset industry as new entrants Apple was one of the disrupters in the mobile handset industry with the launch of its smartphone, the iPhone, in 2007. Despite being a premium offering priced at $499, relative to the majority of feature phones available in the market at that time, the iPhone managed to gain share quickly. Other manufacturers, including Samsung, had already been dabbling with the idea of smartphones by then, starting with the Samsung SPH-I300 launched in 2001. However, the market for smartphones received a boost from the launch of the iPhone by Apple and subsequent launches by Samsung, including the Samsung Galaxy in 2009. Nokia, the large incumbent player globally in feature phones, did not focus on keeping up with the changing consumer preference towards smartphones and quickly lost out on its strong position in the market. As shown in Figure 46, Nokia had 49% global market share in 2007 with Apple and Samsung accounting foronly 3% and 2% market share, respectively. Since then, the market has changed dramatically with only two of the top eight companies from 2007 still remaining today. As shown in Figure 47, Samsung and Apple were ranked 1 and 2 in 2017, respectively. At the same time, it is worth noting that the Smartphone market has become more fragmented, with the top three companies now accounting foronly 48% of total shipments, which compares to 65% in 2007."

Samsung with its broad range of smartphone models maintains a leading position in the low-tier market, followed by newer entrants, such as Xiaomi, Huawei, ZTEandLG."
6101,468,124,"Apple has a small share in the mid-tier smartphone market The mid-tiersmartphonemarket, defined to be in the price range of $151-$600, accounts for roughly 45% of the global market. Apple accounts for 8% of the market with its product offering, including iPhone SE, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus,iPhone 6, andiPhone 5S."
6102,468,125,"Apple has a large share of the premium smartphone market The premium smartphone market, defined as more than $600, accounts for roughly 15% of the global market. Apple is by far the largest player as it accounts for almost three-fourths of the market, followed by Samsung. Together, Apple and Samsung account for 97% of the premium smartphone market. Apples product offering in this premium price range includes the iPhone XS Max, iPhone XS, iPhone XR, iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus, which compete with Samsungs Galaxy Note 9, Galaxy S9, Galaxy S9 Plus, Galaxy Note 8,Galaxy"
6103,468,126,"Apple has a 15% global marketshare, ledbyits premium product offering Apple is estimated to have a global market share of 15% through a combination of modest share in the mid-tier marketand solid share in the premium market. As shown in Figure 63, Apple has no presence in the low-tier market,which accounts for 40% of total shipments. However, Apple has a modest share in the mid-tier market, which accounts for 45% of total shipments, and has three-fourths of the share in the premium market, which accounts for 15% of total shipments."
6104,468,127,"Apple has a strong market share position in Developed countries As shown in Figure 64, Apples market shareof smartphone shipmentsstood at 36% in Developed countries in 2017, compared to only 10% in Emerging countries. Additionally, Apples market share of smartphone shipments has moderated slightly over the last three years in both Developed and Emerging countries."
6105,468,128,"Driving revenue growththrough average selling price increases While Apples limited market share in Emerging countries is an opportunity, we have not seen any appreciable change in strategy, which would allow it to better leverage the forecasted growth for smartphone shipments in Emerging countries. However, Apple has successfully explored a premium pricing strategy to drive revenue growth through consistent increases in prices. As shown in Figure 65, the average selling price of an iPhone has increased 36% since 2007, or 3% per annum, which has recently supported revenue growth as unit shipments have started to plateau."
6106,468,129,"Consumers experience even greater priceincreases onroll-off of subsidies As illustratedin Figure 66, the price to consumersfor iPhonesin certain countries has increased at an even greater pace relative to the 3% CAGR reported by Apple. Specifically, following the initial launch of the iPhone, telecom service carriers sold iPhoneswith a heavy subsidy to make itmore palatablefor consumersin an effort to grow their respectivesubscriber bases. Carrier subsidies, which were quite prevalent historically in the US, limited the price paid by iPhone consumersfrom 2008 to 2013. Followingthat period,carriers moved away from subsidies and instead began offering consumers monthly installment programs to drive device ownershipand replacement."
6107,468,130,"Apples premium smartphone customers demonstrate low price elasticity As shown in Figure 67and Figure 68, iPhone shipments continued to increase despite the roll-off of carrier subsidies starting in 2013. Whileinvestors are concerned about the price elasticity of consumers given Apples pricing strategy, the increase in iPhone shipments long-term indicates to us that investor concerns appear unfounded and the customer demographic targeted by Apple demonstrates very low price elasticity."
6108,468,131,"Success of pricingstrategy demonstrated withadoption of premium smartphone While there is seasonality relative to demand, Figure 69demonstrates that Applestop-end smartphonein any particular period hasbeen successful in capturing a significant portion of consumersin each quarterfollowing its initial release, which has resulted in the increase in Applesblended average selling price. Despite investor concerns relative to demand for premium smartphones, consumers have not shied away from purchasingApplestop-end smartphone."
6109,468,132,"Demand for the latest generation smartphone remains very high Despite Apple increasing the price for every generation of iPhone, consumers have shown a strong preference for the latest generationof phones, which largely reflects preference for incremental features that Apple introduces with each new model. As illustrated in Figure 70, the latest generation of iPhone, which is usually introduced in September of each year, has become the primary contributor to unit shipments for the next four quarters, despite the availability of the previousgeneration for a reduced price. In our view, this demonstrates the premium pricing Apple is able to drive through consumer preference for features introduced on the latest generation of the iPhone."
6110,468,133,"Success of Plus models also contributing to success in pricing strategy Until 2017, the Plus models were the top-end smartphone in Apples portfolio. As shown in Figure 71, Plus models increased as a mix of iPhone shipments as Apple successfully drove a significant proportion of customers to upgrade to the larger screen size for a premium price. Despite the launch of the iPhone Xas Apples top- end smartphone in 4Q17, it only modestly cannibalized the mix of the Plus models, which are still sold at a premium to the corresponding base model with a 4.7 inch screen. For example, the Plus and the Xmodel, both at a premium to the base iPhone model with a 4.7 inch display, accounted for 48% of the mix in 2Q18 26% iPhone Plus 22% iPhone X, which compares to the Plus model accounting for 38% of mix in 1Q17."
6111,468,134,"Expanding the portfolio with more product offerings in recent generations Starting with the launch of the iPhone in 2007, Apple focused its energy on delivering one quality product every year, following up on the first iPhone launch in 2007 with the launch of iPhone 3G in 2008, iPhone 3GS in 2009, iPhone 4 in 2010, iPhone 4S in 2011, and iPhone 5 in 2012. Starting in 2013, Apple moved to a two- product strategy with the launch of the 5C and 5S, followed by the launch of the 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, and 6S and 6S Plus in 2015. Apple has now moved to a three- product strategy with the launch of the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and the iPhone SE in 2016, followed by the launch of the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X in 2017, and the launch of iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR in 2018."
6112,468,135,"Expanding the portfolio, widening the price points By expanding the iPhone model lineup with every generation from one in 2007-12 to three in 2016, Apple is able to offer consumers a wider range of choices in terms of device capabilities, screen dimensions, as well as price points. Maxis $350 starting prices, relative to $100 in 2014 and 2015 when Apple launched two products in each generation."
6113,468,136,"Apple to deliverthe best consumer experience on a small number of models Despite Apple modestly broadening its portfolio over time,we believe itwill continue to focus on delivering a solid consumer experience through a small number of models, rather than pursue a broad portfolio similar to competition. We believe the focus on a smallernumber of models allows Apple to drive higher volume leverage across its portfolio as well as focus marketing spend on fewer products, driving the optimum outcome in relation to both gross margin and operating margins."
6114,468,137,"Fewer models and premium pricing drive best-in-class productmargins We believe the combination of the premium pricing strategy as well as the focus of both RD and marketing spend acrossfewer modelscontributes to Apples stronger margins on iPhones relative to competitors. As shown in Figure 74, Apple delivers stronger margins than any of its competitors in the smartphone industry. Admittedly, some of the companies mentioned below have business interests outside of smartphones, but we estimate Apple has a leadership in margins forsmartphones on a stand-alone basis relative to any competitive products. The higher operating margins are a function of: 1 higher gross margin led byafocus on premium smartphones 2 pricing power with the customer demographic purchasing premium smartphones and 3 lower operating costs, which is a function offocusing on developing 2-3 stand-out smartphone models during a year,allowing for better leverage of costs over greater volumes per phone model."
6115,468,138,"iPhone X: Top-end phone contributing one-third of total shipments to date As shown in Figure 75, despite increasing the price of the top-end iPhone offered from 2016 to 2017 by around $200 25% yy, demand was much stronger than most investors would have expected. Specifically, iPhoneX accounted for 30% of the mix of total iPhone shipments to date, which demonstrates that Apples strategy of launching top-end smartphones with a competitively superior feature set has been successful."
6116,468,139,"Success of top-end strategy stands out relative to primary competitor Samsung Apples strategy tofocus on the top-end smartphone stands out relative to its primary competitor, Samsung. Samsung has a broader portfolio of devices with a wider range of price points, including some smartphones that are comparable in price to Apples top-end phones in certain generations. While we acknowledge the difference in strategies between Apple and Samsung may make a comparison difficult, we think it is important to highlight that as shown in Figure 77, Samsungs top-end smartphone has only reached 20% of total shipments."
6117,468,140,"Apples top-end smartphone contributing an even greater percentage of revenue As shown in Figure 78, not only is the iPhone Xalready contributing one-third of Apples unit shipments, it is also contributing an even greater percentage of the company revenuesroughly 40% to date."
6118,468,141,"Samsungs top-end smartphoneshave contributed a lower portion of revenues While it might not be the most appropriate to compare Samsungs Galaxy S8 Plus and Galaxy S9 Plus to Apples iPhone X, given different portfolio strategies, we believe the comparison can provide insights into the ability to drive towards a very rich mix and maximize margins. As shown in Figure 79, Samsungs top-end smartphone has historically contributed around 17% of revenue relative to the iPhone Xs 40%."
6119,468,142,"Success for Apple and Samsung has been fairly similar with Plus sized models Larger screen sizes have been a driver of higher ASPs as well for smartphone manufacturers, with both Apple and Samsung choosing to label the larger screen size models as Plus and charging roughly $0-$100 premium relative to the base model. When we focus on shipments of smartphones with screen sizes larger than 5.5 inches for both Apple and Samsung, we find that both have had similar success in driving an increasing mix of shipments from larger screen sizes at a premium ASP. However, the roughly similar contribution of mix from Samsung is driven by a higher number of smartphone models relative to Apple."
6120,468,143,"Samsung is slowly increasing ASPs, but remains well behind Apple While Samsung might have some top-end smartphones at comparable prices to Apples, the average ASP for the Samsung portfolio remains well short of Apples. On a year-to-date basis, the average selling price for Apples iPhones are $823 per IDC, which compares to Samsungs$340. Over the last ten years, Apple has increased average ASP by roughly $202 per IDC relative to Samsungs $135. While this might indicate more opportunity for Samsung with high-end smartphones, we think it also indicates that Apple has been more willing to push the pricing barrier in conjunction with delivering technology feature setsthat are at least in linewith, if not better than,the best phones in the market."
6121,468,144,"Volumes for both OEMs have started to plateau Apple and Samsung have captured most of the market share in premium smartphone market. Volumes for both OEMs have started to plateau in recent years, which is likely driven by the maturing penetrationof smartphones in Developed countries."
6122,468,145,"Samsung is following Apples premium pricing strategy Samsung had historically preferred to price its top-end smartphone at a modest discount to Apple in a bid to cannibalize revenue from Apple. More recently, particularly with the recent launch of the Galaxy Note 9, Samsung is now looking to price smartphones in line with or at a premium to Apple. The pricing likely reflects a change in strategy and expectation around price elasticity from Samsung."
6123,468,146,"Smartphones substituting tablets and laptops consumers willing to attribute higher share of wallet to smartphone purchase from savings on other devices One of the primary reasons we believe consumers have been willing to pay an increasing amount for smartphones is the increasing convergence of capabilities of a smartphone with those of a tablet and other personal computing devices, including laptops. The increase in hardware capabilities has not been the sole driver the increasing delivery of web-based content through applications customized for smartphones to keep up with changing consumer preference towards mobility has driven a convergence of the use cases for smartphones relative to other personal computing devices. As shown in Table 18, while the mobile handset industry is still registering modest growth, the marketsfor personal laptopsdesktops and tablets are both declining. With smartphones substituting usage of laptopsdesktopsand tablets, we believe consumersarewilling to attribute incremental share of wallet to the smartphone, driving limited price elasticity relative to expectations."
6124,468,147,"Consumers are increasingly spending more time on a smartphone We believe consumers are spending an increasing amount of time on a smartphone instead of other devices, including tablets, which saw a rapid increase in usage in the early part of this decade. The willingness from consumers to pay an increasing amount for the smartphone has stemmed from their desire tohave a richer experience on the device on which they are spending an increasing amount of time. For example, one of the primary drivers for large screen sizes, or Plus sized models, was that consumers were increasingly consuming content on their smartphones and wanted larger screen sizes to make it more convenient to readview, which in turn increased the opportunity for OEMs to raise pricing."
6125,468,148,"Financing has a lot of headroom to allow pricing to increase Developed countries, including the US, are seeing a modest headwind on the replacement cycle for smartphones led by the discontinuation of subsidies by the carriers to facilitate consumer purchases. However, the headwind is largely being offset by the increasing penetration of financing plans to make the purchases more affordable. According to research published by Kantar, 47% of smartphones sold in the US are linked to installment plans, including 51% of iPhonesand 46% of Androiddevices."

However, product introductions targeting the Emerging countrieshave been infrequent, as we believe Apple continues to prioritize Developed countriesto drive growthas"
6127,468,150,"Apple has limited products targeting Emerging countries Apple has not focused on consistently launching specific products targeting Emerging countries. Apples product strategy has involved positioning the prior years smartphone modelsas the primary product in most of the Emerging countries, at a significantly lower price than the current generation of smartphones. The strategy of pushing the prior years smartphonesin certain Emerging countries allows the pricing to be more affordable by the target demographic. Additionally, with a year of cost reduction opportunities explored on the prior years smartphones, Apple can deliver solid margins despite participating in a more price competitive market."
6128,468,151,"Apples strategy in Emerging countries offers numerous benefits to financials long-term We believe Apples strategy in Emerging countries, in contrast to competitive priority of developing specific products, has several benefits for financials, including: Pricing of the primary model in Emerging countries is more affordable for consumers. With the launch of iPhones every year, the price of the prior years model is trimmed and offers a better price point."

6131,468,154,"With average life cycle of a smartphone in North America close to 2.3 years, the positioning of an older smartphone product inEmerging markets allows the company to fully leverage the RD in developing a product for a longer duration, allowingfor better operating margins than competition."
6132,468,155,"Positioning products in Emerging countries,which already have been launched in Developed countries the prior year, creates an aspirational value attached tothe product by the consumer requiring, in our view, limited incremental marketing spend relative to stand-alone products positioned for the Emerging countries."
6133,468,156,"While the combination of the above does not allow for strong volume opportunity, as Apples smartphone usually remains at the high-end compared to competitive offerings, it does optimize the profitability, in our view."
6134,468,157,"Increasing wealth in Emerging countries to drive iPhone adoption Apples pricing strategy allows for the price of the primary iPhone positioned in an Emerging market to remain more stable than in the Developed markets. While the price of the prior years model is still at the high-endof consumer spending on smartphones in Emerging markets, we expect more and more consumers to enter the target demographic for Apple with increasing wealth of consumer in Emerging countries. As shown in Figure 83and Figure 84, the average selling prices of a premium smartphone in China and India are expected to increase at a robust pace, but lower than the rise in GDP per capita which we treat as a proxy for changes in disposable income in the region."

6167,468,190,"The smart watch market accounts for roughly half of the wearables market While we have seen a lot of new competition come into the already intensely competitive wearables market, capabilities are not uniform across smart watches, which are only a partof the overall wearables market. We estimate smart watches account for roughly 50% of the overall wearables market. The US smart watch market is estimated to be about 13mnunits relative to the US wearables market of 30mnunits."
6168,468,191,"Apple Watch shipments gained momentum in 2017 after taking a pause in 2016 As shown in Figure 114, Apple Watch shipments took a pause after a hugely successful first year in which the companysshare rose to 21% of the wearables market. Subsequently, Apple Watch shipments increased more than 50% yy in 2017. Apple has disclosed that Apple Watch shipments continued to report strong growth in early 2018, including a mid-40% growth rate in the latest quarter."
6169,468,192,"Within the wearables market, IDC forecasts the market for smart watches to expand at a 22% CAGR, from 33mnunits in 2017 to 89mnunits in 2022. We see upside to these already bullish third-party estimates for unit growth in the smart watch market, led by the introduction of additional capabilities in smart watches driven by new digital content and lifestyle tracking features. Additionally, we are in the early stages of 3G4G capabilities being incorporated into smart watches, which will provide additional flexibility to consumers and should drive a replacement cycle for earlier generation smart watches."
6170,468,193,North American smart watch market expected to grow at a 19% CAGR The USmarket for smart watches is estimatedto account for 14mnof the 115mn market. IDC estimates that the US smart watch market will rise at a 19% CAGR through 2022. The strong growth overall for shipments in the US is likely to be accompanied by a moderation in average ASPs as new entrants try to capture market share through less expensive product offerings.
6171,468,194,"Apple Watch penetration into iPhone installed base still relatively modest Apple Watch is in almost all circumstances a purchase for a consumer who owns an iPhone. We see the Apple Watch appealing to all iPhone users, including secondary owners, as an excellent alternative to traditional watches given increasing features like the pedometer, heart rate monitor, andnotification of calls and messages. We estimate that the sale of roughly 14K Apple Watches in FY17 implies only a 1.4% penetration of the iPhone installed base. We expect the increasing penetration of Apple Watch sales with iPhone users to continue to drive strong growth in Apple Watch units, making unit growth more sustainable than investors may expect."
6172,468,195,"Theoretically a TAM opportunity of $385bn Even if Apples installed base of iPhones were to plateau today, we estimate Apple theoretically could still target a revenue opportunity of $385bnwith the Apple Watch if penetration were to reach closer to 100%. Realistically, the penetration of Apple Watches in the iPhone installed base will be lower and should ramp up steadily over time. We expect to see penetration increase in line with gains in the last two years see Figure 117, which we believe will result in continued growth for Apple Watch see Figure 118."

6174,468,197,"Key observationsfrom our installed base calculations: iPhones are three-fourths of the total installed base, driving increased focus to continue to grow the iPhone installed base."
6175,468,198,"Switchers to iOS devices and replacement demand are key to driving growth in installed base. With variations in replacement demand likely to be modest at best through the years, the primary driver of installed base growth should rest onthe ability to get consumers to switch to iOS."
6176,468,199,"As shown in Table 24, if Apple fails to get incremental consumers to switch, replacement demand and new subscriber demand are unlikely to expand enough to offset the shortfall, driving a decline in iPhone unit sales."
6177,468,200,"As shown in Table 24, decline in iPhone unit sales should lead to only a modest single-digit increase in the installed base, restricting opportunities to drive both replacement-led demand and Services revenue growth in the long-run. Apples strategy to focus on developing the best products, even though at a premium price, is to drive incremental consumers to switch to the iOS platform, which is key for growth."
6178,468,201,"Amazon and Google captured the market early on Apple launched its smart speaker, the HomePod, in early 2018, almost three years after Amazons launch of its smart speaker, Alexa, in November 2014, and more than a year after Google announced the launch of the Google Assistant in November 2016. Not only has Apple lost the first-mover advantage in this market, it has also cededthe installed base to Amazon and Google, which is likely to see a longer life cycle relative to either the iPhone or the Apple Watch. As shown in Figure 119, Amazon has 62% share of the smart speaker market, followed by Google at 31%, and other players being fairly small."

Of the 43.9mnunits sold, IDC estimates that 76% or 33.5mnunits were shipped in the US. We believe improvement in network infrastructure in international markets will facilitate stronger adoption of smart speakersin other regions."
6180,468,203,"Current installed base implies minor penetration of homes In the US, smart speaker sales rose from 14mnunits in 2016 to 34mnunits in 2017, more than doubling within a year. While significant, the overall penetration of homes remains fairly modest. An average of one speaker per home would imply a 25% penetration rate of the 136mnhouseholds in the US. However, we believe thereal penetration is potentially much lower at around half that number with an average household owning two devices instead of one. Undoubtedly, penetration of smart speakers remains fairly low in international markets."
6181,468,204,"We expect Apple to further refine the hardware for the HomePod Apple historically has differentiated its products through superior design and aesthetics in addition to the capabilities of the product itself. However, we believe the HomePod, despite being late to the market relative to Amazonand Google, has failed to appeal to consumers in design and aesthetics. We expect Apple to refine the product further in coming generations."
6182,468,205,"Apple Music can be the driver for HomePod sales While the integration of HomePod with Apple Music could drive growth for Apple Music subscriptions longer-term, we expect Apple Music will drive HomePod sales near-term. Specifically, we expect Apple to look to integrate HomePod and Apple Music into a packaged offering in the near-term as the company looks to leverage the success of the Apple Music platform, which boasts 50% of the market share in streaming subscriptions with 43mnmonthly active users in the US."
6183,468,206,"Despite HomePods lackluster start, we do not rule out Apples ability to innovate While the HomePod has not been a success for Apple to date, we do not rule out Apples ability to innovate in terms of product and strategy to drive adoption. While admittedly HomePod has lagged competitors in the smart speaker market, Apple has successfully entered the smart watch market and wireless headphone market over the last few years and is well on its way to establishing itself as the leader in both. For example, the Airpods wireless earbuds have seen significant success in relatively short time after their launch in December 2016 and now have 2% share of the total headphone market including earphonesorganically, and closer to 27% when including Beats, which Apple acquired in 2014."
6184,468,207,"Servicesto be a $68bnbusiness segment by FY21 Apple has inarguably increased its focus on Services in the last few years. The Services segment comprises revenues from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, and Apple Care. As shown in Figure 121, Services accounted for only 8% of total company revenues in FY12, increasing to 13% in FY17. With Apple on track to easily exceed its target of doubling Services revenuesof $24bnin FY16 by FY20E, we believe Services will account for around 20% of total company revenues in FY21E."

As shown in Figure 124, we forecast Service revenue per device to continue to increase at a 16% CAGR from $21 in FY17 to $38in FY21. We expect the primary driver of the increase to be the higher adoption of Apple Care services across the portfolio and across greater number of points in the indirect channel for Apple and Apple Music."

Apple offers Apple Music initially as a three- month free trial, after which consumers have the option to choose from various monthly subscriptions at different price points, which fluctuates from country to country. For example, customers can choose between a Student subscription at $4.99month, an Individual subscription at $9.99month, and a Family subscription at $14.99monthe.g.,access for up to six people in the US. Apple Music is available in 100 countries worldwide and, more importantly, on all Apple devices including CarPlay as well as non-Apple PCs, Android devices, and Sonos devices through iTunes or various app stores."
6192,468,215,"Changing consumer preferences have led tothe rise of streaming music The music industry has seen a fundamental change over the last decade. The era of downloading music to a device and revenue models dependent on downloads has been replaced to a large extent by music as a service in the form of monthly subscriptions to users. The number of people who pay to stream music has grown at a 54% CAGR since 2012,culminating in an estimated 176 million people globally who stream music. This rise in steaming music has disrupted the traditional incumbents in the music industry and driven a change in business models for most music companies in order to survive. Additionally, it has led to an increased incentive for music distributors like Apple and Spotify to engage with musicians, producers, and music labels to create exclusive relationships to differentiate their streaming services relative to competition."
6193,468,216,"Streaming music drives growth in the music industry as a whole The music industry had been struggling and revenues were declining drastically led by illegal downloads and unwillingness of consumers to pay for individual downloads. As shown inFigure 127,IFPI, a not-for-profit international organization registered in Switzerland and representing the recording industry,estimates that worldwide revenues for the recorded music industry declined from $20bnin 2000 to aslow as $14bnby 2014 representing the challenges faced by the music industry in the early 2000s. However, with increasing adoption of streaming, the industry started to see an increase in total revenues and has nowreached an estimated $19bnin 2018."
6194,468,217,"While streaming services have had a strong pace of growth starting from 2014, the contribution of non-streaming services to overall revenues has declined rapidly.

Most recently, Apple announcedthat Apple Music had surpassed 50mn monthly active users MAUs. We estimate that Apple can end FY18E with roughly 54mnusers and continue to drive solid growth in MAUs to more than double the subscriber base by end of FY21E."
6200,468,223,"Apple Musics growth is impressive, but Spotify still holds the streaming crown Spotifyrecentlyannounced that it had surpassed 180mn MAUs, with 83mnof those users paying for the premium service. The difference of 180mn Spotify MAUs versus Apple Musics 50mnappears daunting, but one must consider that Apple Music does not offer a free ad-supported version of its service, so the true comparison has to be between Spotifys 83mn MAUs and Apples 50mnMAUs. While Spotify as a service can monetize the free subscriber base for advertisement revenues, Apple continues to prioritize user experience for paying consumers. As shown in Figure 133, Spotify has been growing users rapidly as well and currently is the leader in the streaming market."
6201,468,224,"Spotify and Apple Music are significantly ahead of competition outside of China The key players in the streaming market include Google Pay Music, Amazon Music, and Pandora in addition to Spotify and Apple Music. Tencent has a near monopoly in Asia however,excluding Tencent the other big five streaming services appear to have around 165mnusers as of mid-2018."
6202,468,225,"Globally Spotify is the leader however,domestically Apple is roughly at par While globally Spotify is the leader in streaming services, the user base is much more balanced in the US led by the tie-in of the smartphone to the choice of a subscription service and the high share for Apple in the US smartphone market. We estimate that Apple has roughly half of its subscriber base in the US, i.e.,around 21mnusers, which compares to Spotifys American user base of around 22mn.

Adding to this the 62 countries in which Apple Music and Spotify both operate brings in another 1.2bn potential consumers. This leads to a total TAM of 2.7bn subscribers in 118 countries.
6205,468,228,"Apple is positioned to address a large TAM with localized pricing In the countries where Apple Music is available, our JPM Internet team observes that Apple Music is an affordable service, making up only 1% of household expenditures. The service is most expensive in Europe, at approximately $11.09month on average for anindividual plan. This is especially striking when compared to regions such as South America and Africa where the individual subscription is offered for $4.20month on average. In the U.S, Apple Music is $9.99month for the individual plan and $14.99monthfor the family plan up to six users. According to the 2017 IFPI Consumer Insight report, roughly 22% of streaming plans are family plans."
6206,468,229,"Apple Music sees higher conversion rate of trial subscribers into paying subscribers Apples growth is assisted by the three-month free trial, which is the companys primary way of gaining new paying MAUs. Unlike Spotify, Apple Music does not offer a free ad-supported version of the product so reliance on the teaser free trial is vital to new consumer onboarding. One year after Apple Musics launch in mid- 2015, Apple Music had a total of 33mn subscribers, with only 17mn paid subscribers, representing roughly 50%conversion rate. Now, three years after launch in 2018, Apple Music has 50mnsubscribers in total, with 40mn of them paying subscribers, representing an increase of the conversion rate to 80%."

While Netflix has different business priorities, focusing more on original content generation and is in the video streaming industry, it is still an interesting comparison to make due to their similar free trial and no free ad-supported model. We believe Netflix has enjoyed 90% retention post free trial, something that Apple Music is trending towards."
6208,468,231,"Apple Music subscribers to account for a larger percentage of Apple device owners We believe one of the drivers of growth for Apple Music will be the increase in penetration of subscribers in the installed base, in addition to benefits from the incremental increase in the installed base on an annual basis. We expect the tight coupling of the iPhone,the Apple Watch, and the HomePod with the Apple Music subscription will enable growth in subscriptions for Apple Music within existing installed base of devices. We estimate the penetration of Apple Music is quite low and in the low-single-digit range at this time. We expect growth in subscribers for Apple Music to be driven by an increase in penetration for Apple Music subscriptions within the installed base and with existing Apple users."

In addition, Apple Pay includes the Wallet app, which stores the Apple Pay Cash card digital money, credit cards, debit cards, as well as other items, such as boarding passes, tickets, and reward cards. The Wallet app supports most major credit cards and debit cards around the world. Apple Pay is available on most Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch, that have some combination of at least two user identifications or two-factor authentication e.g.,passcode, PIN, Touch ID or Face ID. Apple Pay incorporates near field communication NFC in order to enable wireless payments via point-of-salesystems. Utilizing this technology, Apple Pay supports contactless in-person payments via the iPhoneand Apple Watch, which is generally faster than average card transactions. Importantly, Apple does not store card numbers on the device itself or on any of its servers.

Apple Pay Cash, launched in December of 2017, allows users to transfer and receive money, via Apple Messenger or Siri, free of charge when using a debit card and includes a 3% charge when using a credit card. Additionally, after receiving money, users can store the money in their Apple Pay Cash card, which is stored in the Wallet app. To that end, we think the strong adoption of P2P payments is most evident by Venmos owned by PayPal recent success as seen in Figure 148.

9328,681,5,Valuation: Our $56 price target values ABT at 14x EV 2016 EBITDA.
9329,681,7,"Abbott has gone through a series of significant portfolio transitions during the past several years, which have altered the key value drivers for the stock. The stock has risen 55% since the announcement of the AbbVie split in January 2013, relative to a 48% move in the SP 500 Index. Despite the outperformance of ABT shares over the past 2.5 years, we would continue to be buyers of the stock based on our view that 1 Several emerging products in Vascular could diminish the overhang from poor Drug Eluting Stent market fundamentals, 2 Investment in local Chinese infrastructure for Nutritionals places Abbott in a strong competitive position within the most important Nutritional growth market globally, and 3 The stock currently trades at a deep conglomerate discount that could normalize as operating fundamentals improve. We rate ABT a Buy with a $56 price target."
9330,681,8,"Our price target for ABT assigns a Fair Value multiple of 16x EV to our 2015 EBITDA estimate, which puts ABT near the high end of its peer group, but we think our target multiple is justified by an expected 10% EBITDA CAGR through 2017 Figure 1."
9331,681,9,"Key points to Thesis: Long Term Outlook: We think Abbotts portfolio will continue to evolve over the next 5 years, but assets in Established Pharmaceuticals, Established Nutritionals, Medical Optics and Vascular will remain core holdings. Emerging markets will continue to be a primary area of capital deployment, as Abbott spent $4bn on emerging markets acquisitions over the past 2 years, 90% of total MA capital allocated, and generates 47% of total annual revenues from international emerging markets Figure 2."
9332,681,10,"As Abbott improves fundamentals within the Vascular business and investment in China boosts market share in Nutritionals, we think the company can sustain a mid- to high-single-digit growth rate over the next five years, which can lever to sustainable high-single-digit EBITDA growth. Overall we view Abbott as a large cap growth stock that has scarcity value given its strong position in emerging markets."
9333,681,11,Emerging Markets Represented 47% of Annual Sales During 2014
9334,681,12,"ABT short-term alpha performance will be driven by three key themes, 1 Late 2015 FDA submission of Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold clinical data for approval in the US, 2 Commercialization of FreeStyle Libre Flash, and 3 Rebounding sales of Nutritional products in China. Given Abbotts outsized leverage to Emerging Markets compared to its large cap diversified peer group, the stock returns have lower correlation to overall market movements. Abbotts relatively lower market correlation implies greater idiosyncratic risk-return skew, which can make the stock a key focus point for both benchmark- agnostic and benchmark-mindful investors Figure 3."
9335,681,13,"ABT shares Trade at a Moderate 50 60% Correlation to the Major Market Indices Abbott entered into several transformative MA deals during , with the sale of the Animal Health business to Zoetis along with the divestment of the developed markets branded generic business to Mylan for $5.8bn worth of Mylan shares. We estimate that with the 40m share block of Mylan sold during 2Q15, Abbott has near $6bn in cash liquidity. We project that absent any further deals Abbott would end 2015 with a Total Debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.8x and $7.4bn in cash liquidity, which excludes the remaining 70m shares of Mylan, and have an overall MA capacity of at least $12bn Figure 4. The company has been focused on molding its Pharmaceutical business over the past several years, and is likely to remain active as a consolidator of emerging market branded pharmaceutical companies. Beyond Established Pharmaceuticals, we sense the company continues to have a keen interest in building its Medical Optics business along with Vascular. We think the Abbott is less likely to engage in Diagnostics and Nutritional transactions over the next 12-months."
9336,681,14,"Using our financial forecasts for 2015 along with the trading multiples of comparative publicly traded companies for each of Abbotts 6 operating segments, we estimate that Abbott as a consolidated entity is trading at over a 20% discount versus the sum-of-its-parts Figure 5. We have used a combination of data from company filings along with management commentary to tie-out our SOTP EBITDA estimate for the company in 2015 to our aggregate model forecast. Overall, our SOTP analysis suggests that a fair enterprise value for Abbott should be close to 16x our 2015 EBITDA forecast, versus below 14x where the stock currently trades."
9337,681,15,"Abbotts Medical Devices operating segment is comprised of three key business segments Diabetes Care, Medical Optics and Vascular. Operational growth of Abbott Medical Devices has improved over the past several years, after declining -3% during 2012, and we forecast 5% operational growth during 2015."
9338,681,16,"Abbott Vascular represented 17% of total company sales during 2014, and is further delineated into 3 business units: DESBVS, Other Coronary Products and Endovascular Products. The Drug Eluting Stent Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold DESBVS segment is by far the largest business within Vascular Figure 7."
9339,681,17,"We forecast that Abbott Vascular will generate mid-single-digit growth on an operational basis during 2015, as adoption of the Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold BVS provides positive momentum to the DESBVS business Figure 8."
9340,681,18,"We estimate that Abbott Vascular represented 26% of the total 2014 EBIT from the four main operating segments, Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals, Diagnostics and Vascular, and contributed 28% of the EBIT growth Figure 9."
9341,681,19,"Abbott Vascular operating margin reached 36.5% during 2014, and while direct comparisons are difficult to peers given that corporate overhead is not included in Abbott business segment profit estimates, the Vascular business segment does seem to be operating towards the higher end of its peer group range Figure 10. Efficiency initiatives have boosted Vascular margins recently, but going forward, pricing stability within Drug Eluting Stents and the Absorb stent product portfolio will likely be a key driver of margin gains or losses."
9342,681,20,"After years of price declines and flat developed world procedure volumes in the Drug Eluting and Bare Metal Stent markets, Abbott will be reliant on the successful commercialization of the Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold BVS device over the next several years to return its DESBVS business to growth. Abbotts first Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold device has experienced rapid adoption since 2011 in Western Europe, and has held wide ranging 10 50% premium pricing over current Drug Eluting Stents, with recent estimates closer to 10%. Experience in Western Europe provides a positive indication to the ultimate potential for the Absorb product line within the US, but peak penetration of the total Stent market and medium-term pricing stability remain key areas of debate. Data supporting lower cumulative rates of Angina for patients treated with Absorb versus comparable DES procedures supports adoption, but the thicker constitution of Absorb stent versus comparable DES does limit placement in more complex interventions. The most important event for the business segment will be towards the end of 2015 with the FDA submission of Absorb clinical data for approval in the US."
9343,681,21,"During 2014, increased market penetration of Absorb BVS in international markets was offset by decreases in the overall DES market in the US along with market share losses Figure 11. Abbotts DESBVS business declined - 0.9% organically in International markets but declined -12% in the US. While the decline in the US DES market was a worsening of the trend that began in 2012, the organic decline internationally follows what had been mid- to high- single digit growth for the business unit over the past several years."
9344,681,22,"Despite growth challenges for Abbotts DESBVS business overall, the company continues to invest in its family of Drug Eluting Stents and"
9345,681,23,"The XIENCE family of drug eluting stents is generally considered to be a market leading portfolio of devices for revascularization, and the Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold device remains a significant growth opportunity for the company."
9346,681,24,"While we expect European and International markets to remain relatively healthy, and Abbotts market share to remain strong given the rapid uptake of Absorb in those geographies, the approval of Absorb in the US will likely be the most critical factor affecting the growth of Abbotts total DESBVS segment in the coming years. In the scenario analysis below, we show that if we extrapolate recent market trends forward 3 years, BVS would need to gain 10pts of market share per year in the US at a 40% price premium to DES in order for Abbott to return to mid-single digit growth Figure 12. We think our assumptions for Absorb penetration within the US are reasonable, as management has noted that Absorb is reaching 20% of the total DES portfolio in the International markets where the product has been commercially available for several years. However, as Absorb moves towards market penetration that centers BVS as a mainstay workhorse stent, we think the premium pricing relative to DES will likely erode. Management has estimated the Absorb pricing premium to DES in Europe at around 10 20% recently."
9347,681,25,"Other Key Opportunities for Abbott Vascular XIENCE Label Expansion for Chronic Total Occlusions: During October 2014 the XIENCE DES Family became the only drug eluting stent system with an indication to treat Chronic Total Occlusions CTO within the US. CTO is found in 29 - 33% of patients that undergo cardiac catheterization which could translate into a 300,000 annual procedure volume opportunity within the US ."
9348,681,26,"However, given the high rates of off-label use of Drug-Eluting Stents , the volume gain from CTO label expansion is likely to be much lower. Total Endovascular Growth Driven by Rapid Uptake of Supera: During March 2014, Abbott received FDA approval for the Supera peripheral stent, which treats blockages in the Superficial Femoral Artery SFA. The global SFA market has been estimated to be growing at a mid- to high-single-digit rate, with the total market size estimated to be around $550m globally."
9349,681,27,"Absorb could make China a viable DESBMS market: Overall China DES is a $200m market, growing double-digits based on Percutaneous Coronary Intervention PCI growth, and has been underpenetrated, estimated at 120th of the US market. Mix of market share is local stent manufacturers with 75% share, and International companies with 25%. Absorb BVS could work well in China when ultimately launched given the cultural adversity to bare metal stent implantation. Absorb has been launched successfully in Hong Kong, around the 2011 European launch, and Abbott expects to submit Absorb for China FDA approval during 2015."
9350,681,28,"Absorb is a Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold BVS system that elutes everolimus in a similar way to XIENCE V and then resorbs naturally into the body leaving no permanent scaffold. Absorb is comprised of four key design elements: a bioresorbable scaffold, a bioresorbable coating, everolimus and the XIENCE V delivery system. The bioabsorbable structure of the stent is made of polylactic acid, biodegradable polyester derived from lactic acid. During April 2014 the company announced it had completed enrollment of three clinical trials to support approval of Absorb BVS in the US, Japan and China. The product had previously received CE Mark in 2011."
9351,681,29,"The benefits of BVS versus DES are based on the thesis that avoiding a permanent metal structure DES that reduces vessel flexibility also reduces risks associated with stent thrombosis and restenosis. The disadvantage of BVS versus DES is the larger size thicker BVS scaffold versus the DES cage, which could create challenges with delivery in vessels that are very tortuous or narrow."
9352,681,30,ABSORB Trial: Goal of the trial was to evaluate the use of a bioabsorbable drug-eluting stent DES platform among patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention PCI for a de novo coronary lesion.
9353,681,31,"The trial was First-in-man, non-randomized, and results were presented at the American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Session in 2007."
9354,681,32,"ABSORB II: Enrolled 500 people at 46 sites in Europe and New Zealand. The trial was designed as a 2arm randomized trial with XIENCE as the control, 2:1 Absorb BVS: XIENCE."
9355,681,33,"ABSORB III: Enrolled 2,000 people within the US and will evaluate the potential benefits of Absorb in people with coronary artery disease, a narrowing of one of more arteries that supply blood to the heart. The primary endpoint of ABSORB III is target lesion failure TLF, a combined measure of the safety and effectiveness of Absorb in comparison to the XIENCE family of drug eluting stents at one year."
9356,681,34,"ABSORB Japan: Enrolled 400 people within Japan with a primary endpoint of target lesion failure TLF at one year in comparison to the XIENCE family of drug eluting stents. ABSORB China: Enrolled 400 people within China with a primary endpoint of late loss at one year in comparison to the XIENCE family of drug eluting stents. XIENCE Family of Drug Eluting Stents: We estimate that the XIENCE family of stents held approximately 38% share of the worldwide Drug Eluting Stent DES market and 35% share of the US market during 2014 , with the next largest competitors being Boston Scientific BSX, Lavin and Medtronic MDT, Lavin. The family of XIENCE stents have been comprised of the XIENCE V and XIENCE Nano Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System and the XIENCE PRIME and XIENCE PRIME LL Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System, XIENCE Xpedition, XIENCE Xpedition SV and XIENCE Xpediation LL The company recently retired the XIENCE V and XIENCE Prime stent portfolios."
9357,681,35,"Abbott acquired the MitraClip device for percutaneous mitral valve repair through the acquisition of Evalve during 2009 for a price of $320m. The MitraClip device has been available for use in Europe since 2008, but only received FDA approval in late 2013 for Degenerative Mitral Regurgitation deemed High Risk for surgery. Management has stated that peak MitraClip sales could exceed $500m over time, as ongoing studies generate more data regarding the impact on the progression of heart failure. We expect rapid growth to continue near term and model the franchise reaching $280m in sales during 2015, which contributes 150bps of growth to Abbotts overall Medical Devices business Figure 14."
9358,681,36,"Analysis of the EVEREST II trial indicated that percutaneous repair of the mitral valve was less effective with MitraClip versus surgical repair, but the MitraClip device did produce superior safety and clinical outcomes at 12 months. Currently, the Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation COAPT Trial is in the recruiting phase. The COAPT Trial has a primary effectiveness endpoint of recurrent heart failure hospitalizations up to 24 months, which will help determine the safety and effectiveness of the MitraClip device for treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe functional mitral regurgitation in symptomatic heart failure patients."
9359,681,37,"The mitral regurgitation population is roughly 2% of the total population, or 6.8 million people in the US, and 30% of the total mitral regurgitation population has degenerative mitral regurgitation, which constitutes that majority of the surgical repair market. Globally, the market opportunity for surgical repair for degenerative mitral valve regurgitation is 6 million. The revenue opportunity for Mitral Valve implantation has been compared to the rapidly growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement market TAVR , which is currently around $1.5bn in annual sales and is expected to reach $3bn in sales by 2019 Figure 15."
9360,681,38,"MitraClip currently enjoys a competitive landscape that only incorporates surgical repair of the mitral valve. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement TAVR has outpaced the development of Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement TMVR as the structure of the Mitral Valve is several times more structurally complex than the aortic valve. Companies such as Edwards Lifesciences are developing replacement mitral valves Figure 16, and initial efforts with FORTIS have proven feasibility, but additional development work will need to be completed over the next several years prior to a fully commercially viable product. Edwards temporarily suspended enrollment into the FORTIS trial program during May 2015 due to evidence of valve thrombosis with the mitral valve replacement device."
9361,681,39,"Revenues from sales of MitraClip are currently recorded in the Other segment under Abbott Vascular, along with sales of Bare Metal Stents BMS and Royalties from Drug Eluting Stents DES. Rapid growth of MitraClip has offset modest declines from the remainder of assets within Other Vascular over the past several years Figure 17. We forecast that $80m of incremental sales from MitraClip will offset a -$20m, or -10% decline in revenues from BMS and Royalties during 2015."
9362,681,40,"Abbotts Medical Optics business has been one of the fastest growing segments within the company, and although the segment generates only 6% of total sales, Medical Optics contributed 9% of total organic growth during 2014. The key growth driver of Medical Optics has been strong product performance in the surgical cataract market, which represents 69% of total Medical Optics sales. During 2014, double-digit growth of surgical cataract sales offset declines in the refractive and corneal business segments Figure 18. We expect Abbotts Medical Optics business to maintain recent momentum as rising penetration of Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery FLACS couples with new product launches in the existing Tecnis intraocular lens franchise IOLs."
9363,681,41,"International markets represent 64% of total Medical Optics sales and are expected to continue growing high-single-digits during 2015, as emerging markets continue to rapidly increase procedural volumes for cataract. Demand for cataract surgery on a global basis is expected to continue growing rapidly through 2020, as the World Health Organization WHO has estimated that of the 285m people who were visually impaired, 80% of visual impairment is avoidable with 33% of cases a result of cataract."
9364,681,42,"surgical sales are estimated to constitute 80% of total ophthalmic surgical industry sales, at over $7.2bn annually Figure 19. The market for cataract surgical equipment is expected to continue growing high-single-digits for the remainder of the decade as emerging countries implement programs in line with the long running WHO VISION 2020 plan. Estimates place the number of cataract surgeries annually at 19 million on a global basis with 3 million in the United States. The number of surgeries is expected to grow to 32 million by 2020 as the global population ages."
9365,681,43,"Adoption of Femtosecond Laser-assisted Cataract Surgery OptiMedica began US shipments of the Catalys Precision Laser System in the US during February 2012, after an International launch in late 2011. The Femtosecond Laser supplants manual scalpel incision into the capsule of the crystalline lens of the eye, or capsulotomy, the primary step ahead of phacoemulsification in a cataract surgical procedure. Initial adopters reported that usage of a femtosecond laser increased precision, accuracy and reproducibility versus the standard manual technique, thusly justifying the introduction of an instrument that costs over $500k and incurs significant upkeep costs Figure 20."
9366,681,44,"Clinical evidence regarding outcomes of femtosecond-laser assisted cataract surgery FLACS versus manual methods look somewhat underwhelming for a procedure that already has less than a 1% surgical adverse event rate. While FLACS has been noted to make highly accurate and reproducible capsulotomies, the low variability of a trained surgeon using manual procedures lowers the utility value of the laser precision. Furthermore, FLACS presents an additional logistical issue for centers that separate the laser from the operating room, which would introduce additional time for patient transport."
9367,681,45,A metadata analysis by the Evidence-based Synthesis Program ESP Center presented to the Department of Veterans Affairs in late 2013 found no stable differences between manual corneal incisions and anterior capsulotomies followed by phacoemulsification and procedures supplanted by a femtosecond
9368,681,46,"During early 2015 a large outcomes and safety study of more than 4,000 cases at a single center also seemed to confirm the findings of the VA metadata analysis FLACS and manual surgical methods for cataract surgery seem to have no statistical difference with regard to safety ."
9369,681,47,"Although clinical data has yet to prove the utility of FLACS in one way or another, adoption of FLACS within the US has been rapid within the first three years of product availability. A robust out-of-pocket market for vision correction has helped to drive adoption of FLACS, as any additional costs incurred over the reimbursement for manual surgery are born by the patient and not Medicare or Private Insurance. A survey of surgeons during 2013 suggested that the per case incremental fee revenue varied depending on IOL Figure 21, but the calculated average incremental fee per case of $859 would suggest that the payback period for the laser would be 1,134 laser cases during a 5-year period."
9370,681,48,"Penetration of FLACS within the United States has been estimated to be 10% of all cataract surgical procedures, and is expected to reach maturity at 30% of all procedures near the 2020 timeframe . Global adoption of FLACS should continue to be a secular growth opportunity for Abbott Medical Optics as the developed world ages and emerging market consumers demand higher value healthcare services Figure 22."
9371,681,49,"Alcon is considered to be the market leader in FLACS with its LenSx platform followed by Abbotts Catalys system by OptiMedica, and then several other platforms round-out the competitive landscape Figure 23. We estimate that Abbotts OptiMedica business currently has approximately 10 15% market share of the global cataract surgical market, and has likely gained market share post the OptiMedica acquisition during 2013. Management has estimated Abbotts global market share to be closer to 25% for surgical cataract based on the specific markets where they currently compete."
9372,681,50,"Abbotts $1.2bn Diabetes Care business represented 22% of total Medical Device revenue during 2014 and was a significant detractor to overall growth, as the business declined -8% on an organic basis. A -22% organic revenue decline in the US business overwhelmed 2% growth within International markets. Management has forecasted a return to low-single-digit revenue growth in the global segment for the full year 2015, and seems to be on track, as the company reported 2.8% YoY organic revenue growth during 1Q15. Our 2015 revenue forecast for 3.7% YoY organic revenue growth is based on a combination of strong global sales ramp of the FreeStyle Libre Flash along with a stabilization of pricing within the US market Figure 24."
9373,681,51,"Rollout of Competitive Bidding Program in US Pressured Diabetes Care Revenues in 2013 and 2014 The Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS implemented Round 2 of the Competitive Bidding Program on July 1, 2013, that harmonized the reimbursed bidding rate to $10.41 per 50-count box for both mail order and non-mail order diabetes test strips. Beyond the direct price decline from the $14.62 per 50-count box reimbursement that had been enacted in 2011, as a result of the Round 1 Rebid, and $37.67 national average payment for non- mail order diabetes test strips, the Round 2 implementation greatly altered market share amongst providers Figure 25. Abbotts FreeStyle Lite test strips lost at least 3% market share as a result of the National Mail Order Program, slipping from 3% to less than 1%. The bidding process for a Round 2 Recompete began in Fall 2014 and will be effective July 1, 2016. While no theoretical floor exists for pricing, and market share could remain volatile, we largely see the damage as done with the implementation of the National Mail Order Program during 2013."
9374,681,52,"FreeStyle Libre Differentiates Within Continuous Blood Glucose Meter Market Abbott received CE Mark for the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System in early September 2014. The system reads glucose levels through a silver-dollar sized sensor that can be worn on the back of the upper arm for up to 14 days. The device measures glucose every minute through a 5mm long, 0.4mm wide filament that is inserted just under the skin, which senses glucose levels in interstitial fluid and makes an estimate of plasma glucose levels. Reviews of the Libre have been positive, regarding ease of use along with length of use versus other platforms Figure 26, but some variation in device performance has been acknowledged as a function that the devices are factory calibrated versus user calibrated. Overall, the launch of the FreeStyle Libre has made strong initial inroads within Europe, and management has targeted a commercial launch in several additional ex-US countries during 2015. Abbott completed enrollment for the US trial of FreeStyle Libre in March 2015, but management has not provided a specific timeline for US commercial launch."
9375,681,53,"Estimates have placed the global market for self-monitoring of blood glucose between $6 9bn annually, which includes finger stick devices . Also, around the launch of the FreeStyle Libre Flash, Abbott management indicated the market opportunity in Europe alone was $4bn and the total global market was over $8bn. The International Diabetes Federation has estimated that 387m people are living with diabetes in the world, with 39m in North America and 52m in Europe. Prevalence rates globally have continued to rise, approximately near 110 people within the total population. The percent of the 20 year old population in US with clinically diagnosed diabetes has steadily risen, from 5.2% estimated in the estimation period to over 9% in 2014 Figure 27, and is now potentially more than 11% of the 20 year old population if undiagnosed cases are included."
9376,681,54,"Abbotts $4.7bn global diagnostics business is split into 3 key segments, with 80% of revenues generated from Core Laboratory products, 10% of sales from Molecular testing and 10% of sales from Point-of-Care testing. The Diagnostics business has generated steady mid-single-digit operational growth over the past 3 years, with Point-of-Care diagnostic sales growing mid- teens. While Point-Of-Care growth has outpaced Core Laboratory growth over the past 3 years, the outsized weighting of Core Laboratory sales make it the dominant determinant of growth within the overall business. We forecast lower overall growth for Abbott Diagnostics during 2015, with slightly stronger growth in Molecular and Point-Of-Care offsetting lower growth rates in the Core Lab business Figure 28."
9377,681,55,"We estimate that Abbott Diagnostics represented 25% of the 2014 EBIT from the four main operating segments, Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals, Diagnostics and Vascular, but contributed only 15% of the EBIT growth Figure 29."
9378,681,56,"We think recent revenue growth trends are likely to continue over the next several years supporting profit growth, but the efficiency gains of recent years are likely to not be repeated as Abbott Diagnostics operating margin is now above industry comps. Operating profit margins of the Diagnostics business have improved significantly since 2009, from 11% to 23% in 2014, but yearly gains have become more subdued as the operating segment has surpassed industry peer profit levels Figure 30. Peers such as bioMerieux, Qiagen and Sysmex reported EBIT margins of 10%, 14% and 20% respectively, during the past fiscal year."
9379,681,57,"Favorable Geographical Mix Supports Higher Growth but Competition Intensity is Likely Increasing The revenue size profile of Abbott Diagnostics three major segments closely matches a generalized breakdown of the global diagnostics market, although notably, the mid- to high-single-digit growth of Abbott Diagnostics Core Lab business over the past several years seems to have outpaced the low-single- digit growth of the global core lab market Figure 31. We attribute the outperformance of Abbott Diagnostics Core Lab business versus the overall market due to Abbotts over indexing to International and Emerging Markets, as the International business of Abbott Diagnostics Core Lab business represented 80% of the total Core Lab segment during 2014."
9380,681,58,"International Markets have been a key growth driver for Abbott Diagnostics, as International Sales represented 72% of total Abbott Diagnostics sales during 2014. Operational growth in International markets has outpaced US growth by 1% in Core Lab, 9% in Molecular, while lagging exceptional double-digit growth in US Point-of-Care by -6%, although Point-of-Care is less than 10% of total Diagnostics sales Figure 32."
9381,681,59,"Management forecasted 2015 growth to be similar to that of 2014 for Abbott Diagnostics, which would be a continuation of the steady mid-single-digit growth recorded over the past 3 years. We think this is a reasonable assumption, as market growth rates continue to benefit from rapid development of Hospital systems in emerging markets such as China Figure 33. Management has estimated that the Core Lab Diagnostics market in China to be $2bn annually and is expected to grow 15% annually through 2018 ."
9382,681,60,"Longer term we think Abbott Diagnostics Core Lab business could face some increasing competitive pressures in blood testing from Beckman Coulter Danaher and PerkinElmer, as both companies have also been growing their presence in China among other emerging economies. Point-of-Care diagnostics is a smaller business to Abbott Diagnostics, but we would note that the continuing turn-around of Alere may make a continuation of growth in recent years less likely, as Abbotts i-STAT business has benefitted from missteps with Aleres Triage platform."
9383,681,61,"Abbotts Nutrition division represented 34% of total company sales during 2014, and is comprised of two key business segments, Pediatric and Adult, which constituted 56% and 44% of total segment sales respectively. The business can be further delineated into five sub-segment product areas: Infant Mother, Child, Adult, Sports Active Living, and Therapeutic Nutrition. Abbott Nutrition has been a key driver of total segment operational growth over the past several years although growth dynamics have shifted recently, with growth slowing in the Pediatric business while accelerating in Adult market Figure 34. Management guided for an acceleration of Nutritional operational growth to high-single-digits versus mid-single-digit growth during 2014, with a key catalyst being the annualization of the product recall in China that negatively impacted Pediatric revenues in early 2014. We currently forecast 7% operational growth for Abbott Nutrition in 2015, up from 5% during 2014."
9384,681,62,"We estimate that Abbott Nutrition represented 34% of the 2014 EBIT from the four main operating segments, Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals, Diagnostics and Vascular, but contributed 42% of the EBIT growth, as the Nutrition business segment expanded operating margins 200bps during the year Figure 35."
9385,681,63,"Abbott Nutritional operating margins have expanded towards peers such as Mead Johnson over the past several years Figure 36. However, we would note that as Abbott continues to increase revenue exposure into emerging markets such as China, there could be a negative effect on overall margins, as it seems local competitors in China such as Synutra SYUT, Not Covered, do operate at a lower margin profile versus global companies. On the other hand, local investment by Abbott could support current business margins as local production costs would presumably also be lower."
9386,681,64,"Pediatric Nutrition Expected to Rebound Post Recalls Abbotts Pediatric Nutrition business experienced a marked slowdown in growth during 2013 and 2014 as the business faced headwinds both domestically and internationally. We forecast a reacceleration of growth in both the US Pediatric and International Pediatric businesses during 2015, as the company will lap the share losses in US Government programs and in China, that both negatively impacted the business over the past 2 years Figure 37. During the first quarter of 2015 the company posted 4.5% growth in US Pediatric, the strongest growth rate in two years, and Internationally the Pediatric business grew 11%, sustaining the growth reacceleration that began in 2H2014."
9387,681,65,"The US Pediatric Nutrition business was flat during 2013 and then declined -1% during 2014, with the primary driver being share loss in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children WIC. Accelerating share loss in WIC during 2014 was a change to the infant formula product line that caused several products to no longer meet the WIC caloric requirement. However, Abbott has maintained market leadership in the non- WIC Pediatric channel within the US, with new product launches of PediaSure Toddler brand, Similac Total Comfort and Similac with OptiGRO helping to boost retail sales."
9388,681,66,"The impact of the recall was estimated to have impacted total Pediatric sales growth in 2013 by -5% and by -3% during 2014. Despite the significant product recall by Fonterra, Abbott announced a strategic alliance with Fonterra during 3Q14 to develop local milk supply infrastructure within China, versus sole importation from New Zealand. This endeavor builds on Abbotts prior investments in local Chinese infrastructure that has included an RD center in Shanghai and a nutrition manufacturing plant in Jiaxing. During 3Q14 the company launched Similac QINTI into the Chinese market as the first domestically manufactured product at the new China facility."
9389,681,67,The alliance is subject to Chinese regulatory approval. Both companies will work with Chinese regulators to obtain necessary approvals through the course of project development.
9390,681,68,"If the alliance is successful and approved by Chinese regulators, both companies will form a joint venture. Under the JV, Fonterra and Abbott will invest a total of US$300m NZ$342m or 1.8bn RMB into the farm hub. The farm hub will produce up to 160m liters of milk annually, contain up to 5 dairy farms and more than 16,000 dairy milking cattle. The animals will either be imported or sourced from Fonterras existed farm hubs. Currently pending regulatory approval, the first farm hub is expected to be completed by 1H17 and the remainder will commence production in 2018."
9391,681,69,"The Chinese Pediatric Nutritional market will be an important growth driver for Abbott over the next 5 years, as the Chinese market is expected to be the fastest growing geography and largest overall market for infant milk formula through 2019 Figure 38."
9392,681,70,"We think Abbott has favorable prospects in China, as we anticipate that locally investing in infrastructure for milk supply along with RD centers and manufacturing plants will give the company an edge over competition regarding Government support. News reports in late 2013 suggested that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology hopes to reduce the number of manufacturers of infant formula to 3 5 firms with revenues exceeding US$8bn per year by 2018 . Given the current fragmentation of the Chinese Infant Nutrition market, along with Abbott only holding less than 10% of the total market Figure 39, we think this sets up the company for strong growth in China over the next several years and will be a key driver of overall Pediatric Nutrition growth."
9393,681,71,"Adult Nutrition Benefits From Aging of the Global Population Abbotts Adult Nutrition business has grown at a steady mid-single-digit rate over the past several years, and we expect that trend to continue during 2014 as we forecast 6% operational growth. While the overall growth rate of the Adult Nutrition business has been steady, there has been a divergent growth trend between declines in US product sales and accelerating double-digit growth within International markets Figure 40. We forecast a continuation of recent trends during 2015 with the overall Adult Nutrition business growing 6%, comprised of a -3% decline in the US offset by 13% growth within International markets."
9394,681,72,"Abbotts Adult Nutritional business has declined over the past several years within the US as the company exited certain product lines in an effort to improve the overall margins of the business, and at the same time faced competitive pressures on their leading Ensure brand from private label sellers such as Perrigo and Wal-Mart. Abbotts share in the US meal replacement market has declined modestly over the past several years, with the company still the 1 brand, but share gains of Ensure have moderated and some of the smaller product lines such as Zone Perfect have lost share Figure 41. While only tangential competitors, companies such as Herbalife do seem to be picking up consumer wallet share in the younger demographic of meal replacement within the US. Given the current controversy over non-traditional fitness shake companies, such as Herbalife, we think it is hard to predict what the net effect on the traditional channels that Abbott sells through will be over the next several years."
9395,681,73,"We estimate that the $10.1bn worldwide meal replacement market could grow 4 6% annually over the next several decades as the global population ages Figure 42, which is in line with the 5 6% rate the industry grew over the past 3 years."
9396,681,74,"While we forecast the global meal replacement industry to grow mid-single- digits annually, Abbott may be able to augment growth with exposure to emerging markets, which have been growing double-digits, as a rise of the middle class consumer is expected to continue to occur in countries such as China over the next decade Figure 43."
9397,681,75,"Therapeutic Nutrition an Evolving Opportunity Medical Foods are specially tailored to help treat the underlying nutritional deficiencies of a specific disease. The market for Medical Foods has been estimated to $9bn with $2.1bn in the US, and has been estimated to be growing 10% annually . Market share estimates for the Medical Food industry are difficult to come by, but the main players are similar to the adult nutrition market, with Abbott, Nestle and Nutricia being market leaders. The key difference between Medical Foods and Adult Nutrition is that Medical Foods are semi regulated by agencies such as the FDA, as they produce foods that are prescribed by clinicians to help treat specific medical conditions."
9398,681,76,"Abbott Nutrition: Background Information Founded in 1903, Abbott Nutrition is a worldwide leader in nutritional science, research and development of a broad line of nutritional and therapeutic products. Abbotts products are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide to help infants and children grow, maintain healthy and strong bodies and support the unique needs of patients with chronic illnesses. Abbott Nutrition is a business division of Abbott Labs that researches and develops science based pediatric and adult innovative products in the areas of tolerance, cognition, immunity, inflammation, metabolism, and lean body mass."
9399,681,77,"Abbott Nutrition launched 65 new products in 2014. Adult Nutrition represents 44% in this business segment and has a leading position as 1 or 2 in 25 countries, with 50 Abbott consumer brands in 100 countries. Throughout 2014, Abbott opened nutritional manufacturing plants in China, India and the US as well as an RD center in China. In addition, to further expand its footprint, Abbott announced the strategic partnership with Fonterra to develop a dairy farm hub in China."
9400,681,78,"For over 30 years, the Ensure brand has provided a variety of formulated shakes for active adults with a source of nutritional value to help reach specific nutritional goals such as enhancing the immune system, supporting the digestive tract and rebuilding muscle. The Ensure brand was launched in China as of 2014 as a long term growth opportunity."

9402,681,80,"For more than 85 years, Similac formulas have been developed by leading scientists and more than 280 clinical studies to help mothers and infants a strong start to a healthy life. Similac has a broad portfolio of Similac products, all specialized for different nutritional needs. Abbott launched Similac Qinti and Eleva in 2Q14 in China in an effort to recapture market share lost in the countries affected by its recall. Similac Qinti and Eleva were both launched in China and will be manufacturing at the newly developed plant."
9403,681,81,Similac Qinti - Contains the newest formulation and employs 3 QINTI technologies.
9404,681,82,"Similac Breastfeeding Supplement launched in US designed to enhance levels of DHA, lutein and Vitamin E in breast milk."
9405,681,83,"Recent productsupcoming product launches: Over the past several years, Abbotts nutrition business has averaged more than 70 new product launches annually. Abbott has brought leading infant and adult nutrition products to china which includes the launch of Ensure, Eleva and Similac Qinti."
9406,681,84,"The most recent product launch was the new Similac breast feeding supplement with DHA, lutein and vitamin E. The new product was specially designed to enhance the levels of these nutrients in breast milk. A research study concluded that lactating women did not consistently consume enough key nutrients such as DHA, lutein and vitamin E through their diets. According to The Journal of Nutrition, Lutein is an important antioxidant, supports eye health and enhances infant growth development. In addition, as noted in The Journal of Pediatrics, DHA helps support Infant brain development. However, Infant brain development is highly susceptible to oxidation which vitamin E protects from."
9407,681,85,"In December 2014, with the support of the Patients Association, Abbott Nutrition launched the I-CARE Checklist to help people spot signs of malnutrition in their older relatives and friends and to take action. Malnutrition is a serious condition that occurs when a person does not get enough nutrients. This could be because their diet is inadequate or because they have problems absorbing nutrients from food. In the UK, 1 in 10 people aged over 65 are malnourished. In addition, 88% of people do not recognize the most common signs of malnutrition and only 15% are concerned that their older relatives are not eating well."
9408,681,86,"2013 China Recall Fonterra supplied whey powder that contained bacteria that could cause botulism to Danone. Abbott recalled two batches of Gain Advance Stage 3 infant formula in China. Although the products were not supplied with the contaminated ingredient, the company indicated that it recalled its products because they were packaged on Fonterras production line. Only 112 boxes of more than 7,000 produced had been sold."
9409,681,87,"The Abbott Fund Institute of Nutritional Science Established in 2007, The Abbott Fund Institute of Nutritional Science AFINS is the result of a partnership between the Abbott Fund, the nonprofit organization Project Hope and Shanghai Childrens Medical Center SCMC. This collaborative partnership helps improve clinical pediatric nutrition practices through professional training, innovative research development of nutrition supports protocols, and community outreach."
9410,681,88,"Abbott Established Pharmaceuticals represented 15% of total company sales during 2014, and is entirely focused on selling branded generics into emerging markets. The two reporting segments within Established Pharmaceuticals are delineated by geography, Key Emerging Markets and Other Emerging Markets, with Key Emerging Markets primarily comprised of Brazil, China, India and Russia, with the largest single geography being India Figure 44."
9411,681,89,"Operational growth rates for the Established Pharmaceuticals business and its sub segments have been clouded by acquisitions and divestitures, but the management team has highlighted that the business is growing high-single- digits organically, and that Abbott is slightly outpacing overall market growth rates Figure 45."
9412,681,90,"Abbott management has embarked on a unique strategy with the Established Pharmaceuticals business, focusing efforts 100% in Emerging Market countries, and on 5 core therapeutic areas, Anti-Infectives, Cardio metabolic, Gastroenterology, PainCentral Nervous System and Anti-Infectives. The company also has an influenza vaccine franchise, but it is expected to receive less aggressive investment versus the 5 core areas. Established Pharmaceutical assets mostly target out-of-pocket sales, versus insured reimbursement, in areas where brand focus can dominate local competitors."
9413,681,91,"Abbott has expanded into Latin America and Russia with recent acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals for $3.4bn LatAm and Veropharm for $305m Russia, and is actively looking to build a larger presence within India."
9414,681,92,"We estimate that Abbott Established Pharmaceuticals represented 15% of the 2014 EBIT from the four main operating segments, Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals, Diagnostics and Vascular, and contributed a proportionate 16% of the EBIT growth Figure 46."
9415,681,93,"Abbott Established Pharmaceuticals operating margin reached 20% during 2014, and although direct comparisons to generic companies such as Dr. Reddys and Sanofi are difficult given the nuances in product mix, Abbotts Established Pharmaceutical margins generally seem in line with industry peers Figure 47."
9416,681,94,"Right now the Established Pharmaceutical business is in investment mode, but longer term, management thinks that there is a margin expansion opportunity, as Abbott still has some legacy European plants that are not optimal for operations and the company will likely move more cost to local geographies over time."
9417,681,95,"Furthermore, RD expense is more weighted towards Development versus Research for the Established Pharmaceutical strategy, as Abbott takes licensed assets, develops them into commercial products, and then iterates products and registers across geographies. The net effect of this strategy should produce high incremental margins on revenues."
9418,681,96,"Background Information Abbott Established Pharmaceuticals EPD, established in 2010 and headquartered in Basel Switzerland, offers highly qualified and affordable branded generic medicines that successfully treated patients for many years. In 2014, Abbott took several steps in the established pharmaceutical segment by strengthening its product portfolio, building geographic presence and increasing focus on growth markets. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In 2014, it expanded this business through two acquisitions, CFR pharmaceuticals and Veropharm, which significantly enhanced the portfolio and presence in Latin America and Russia."
9419,681,97,"On September 26, 2014, Abbott acquired CFR Pharmaceuticals S.A. CFR. Abbott purchased 99.6% of CFRs ordinary shares for $3.4bn. Abbott established itself among the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in Latin America and further expanded the companys presence in rapidly growing markets through the acquisition of CFR."
9420,681,98,"On December 12, 2014, Abbott acquired Veropharm, a leading Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer. Abbott acquired Veropharm for 16.7bn Rubles US$305m and through the acquisition, Abbott established a manufacturing footprint in Russia and obtained a portfolio of medicines that were well aligned with Abbotts pharmaceutical therapeutic areas of focus in womens health such as the central nervous system, cardiovascular and gastroenterology."
9421,681,99,"Abbott is the number one pharmaceutical company in India, Chile, Colombia and Peru and top five in Russia. Abbott Established Pharmaceuticals has 27 manufacturing sites, 10 pharmaceutical development sites, 1500 products in its portfolio in over 88 countries in which in which they have commercial presence."
9422,681,100,"Key Products Figure 48: Abbotts established pharmaceuticals business focuses mainly on country specific portfolios that are made up of global and local pharmaceutical brands that best meet the needs for patients in each country. Abbott has more than 300 branded generic development projects, and over the next several years Established Pharmaceuticals plans to expand its product portfolio in its key markets through the development and launch of new branded generics with the aim to be among the first to market a new branded generic for a particular pharmaceutical product, further geographic expansion of existing brands, new product enhancements and strategic licensing activities. Abbott is also actively working on development plans for several key brands such as Creon and Influvac. Based on the product, the development activities focus on new data, markets, formulations and combinations or indications."
9423,681,101,"We think management has executed several impressive acquisitions over the past decade including Knoll, Advanced Medical Optics, CFR, Veropharm, Topera, Idev Technologies, OptiMedica, etc. which aligns Abbott in a favorable position for growth and profitability. We think that the recent additions of CFR and Veropharm will contribute a value-add to its established pharmaceuticals business which should provide a significant footprint in both Latin America and Russia. Furthermore, the sale of Abbotts EPP business to Mylan should help Abbott refocus its efforts on emerging markets and profit from the increased demand. We see that managements efforts to improve efficiency through streamlining the company has developed success and improved margins for Abbott and think that the foundations are well developed for future growth."

9427,681,105,"Over the past 4 years we estimate that ABT has exceeded quarterly analyst estimates 88% of the time, but that the stock has only produced positive alpha on these quarterly surprises 47% of the time. However, a macro pattern does seem to suggest that investors are rewarded for positive results, as the string of negative stock returns during the 4Q13 to 3Q14 period coincided with negative headline events such as the product recalls within the Nutritional segment Figure 51."
9428,681,106,"Quarterly results over the next 12-months could produce positive event alpha for investors, as accelerating operational growth across Vascular, Nutritionals and Established Pharmaceuticals could drive higher incremental margins versus what is currently expected by our estimates and the street Figure 52."
