AMZN: We Think the Street – Buy- and Sell-side are September 30, 2020
Looking at SOTP Wrong (Us Included). We are Reframing
Why AMZN is the Best Mega-cap on a Multi-year Basis.
BOTTOM LINE: We and almost every other investor we have spoken to over the years, has been MICHAEL LEVINE
framing the AMZN SOTP valuation wrong. Amazon advertising is only ~5% of revenues, but is far greater 212-514-4682
contributor to overall non-AWS EBIT margins than the street recognizes. Said differently, If advertising 
was viewed as a stand-along business unit (we will explain why it shouldn’t be), it would represent well
north of 300% of 2020E non-AWS EBIT.
Amazon (AMZN)
Based on our view that there is massive upside by 2024E, we increase our PT to a Street high of $4,500
based on an average of our 2024 SOTP and 30x our 2024 EBIT “power” of $91bn vs. our in-print RATING: BUY
estimates of $71.5bn and the street at $69bn- both of these are modeled back at 10%, Overall, we think (Previous: BUY)
investors are materially underestimating the earnings power of the business. We are going to be good
bulls (not all our colleagues always are) and not factor all of the goodness in our estimates. We wanted Target Price: $4,500
to frame a highly likely outcome, as well as dynamics of the AMZN business that we this not totally (Previous: $3,925)
appreciated. As a long time buy-sider, I think one of the most important values the sell-side can bring is
reframing an underappreciated dynamic. We don’t think we are going to disappoint. Price (9/30/20): $3,148.73
We would highlight that this is not a short-term call. We do think Street estimates for fulfillment in
particular are modeled too low in H121 based on the company’s message that they are embarking on
another fulfillment center investment cycle – made loud and clear in our view on the 2Q20 call. Also, we
all know eCommerce has seen a massive acceleration from the pandemic, but can imagine guiding could
be challenging. Long term, we would bet that over a 4-year period a Long AMZN / Short the market MARKET DATA
position will be handsomely rewarded. 52 Wk Hi - Low $3,344 - 1,626
Market Cap. (MM) $1.52tn
There are a few observations we wanted to highlight:
Avg. Daily Vol (000) 2.5
 Everybody who is using a SOTP model for AMZN is doing so incorrectly (ourselves too). We
also are not huge fan of SOTP models because the Buy-side or Sell-side makes inaccurate EPS 2020E Prior 2021E Prior
conclusions, but in AMZN’s case think is necessary. Why we are not a fan: 1Q 5.09 5.09 9.18 6.76
 These SOTP analyses are often done as means to justify that a company is worth
more than it is currently trading at, but let us be clear. Analysts may lie – the market 2Q 10.49 2.26 13.02 10.75
doesn’t lie - and the associated price a stock currently trades at is what it is. It can 3Q 7.96 2.93 13.24 10.71
turn out to be true, taking the case of Icahn’s successful push to separate PYPL from
EBAY. We would argue there are a lot more reasons that untethered from EBAY, 4Q 9.6 4.82 17.33 12.45
PYPL has been able to transform into a different business than it would if still owned
by EBAY. But back to our initial point, analysts may lie – stocks don’t lie. Massive FY 33.1 15.10 40.67 40.67
kudos to whomever bet alongside Mr. Icahn, but this has been a grand slam home
run, with PYPL alone at a 230bn mkt cap.
 We do not remotely subscribe to the thesis that AWS profits – highly profitable and P/E 163x 60.8x
quantifiable – are being used to “subsidize” retail losses.
Sales 2020E Prior 2021E Prior
 SOTP debates aside, we would all concur that more disclosure is better than less disclosure. 1Q 75.5 75.5 94.4 90.9
This typically leads to multiple expansion given investors greater understanding of the different
moving pieces of complex businesses. Examples we would cite are BABA (cloud and offline 2Q 88.9 80.9 99.6 95.3
have been huge drags on a highly profitable core business), NFLX (domestic is highly 3Q 92.8 87.8 108.9 103.7
profitable vs international), and GOOG most recently took a cue from some of these other
mega-caps. Ironically, AMZN over the last few years has gone from the mega-cap disclosing 4Q 115.8 111.1 135.8 128.9
the least to the one disclosing the most.
FY 355.3 355.3 438.8 418.8
 Now let’s chitty chat AMZN. We think the street often tries to ascribe different multiples to AWS
(they certainly should), advertising, subscription, FBA, GMV, 1p revs, 3p revs etc. You name it,
BALANCE SHEET DATA (6/30/20)
somebody has done it. The only reported FACTS we have about OI is AWS, Domestic and
International so all the other assumptions are being made by the Street. Cash ($) $71.4bn
We have historically modeled for our SOTP: 1) Domestic and 2) International GMV (we gross Debt ($) $75bn
up the 3rd party GMV and admittedly are making an assumption on the take rate, as it likely has Debt/Equity 0.98x
only continued to uptick given FBA growth), 3) AWS, 4) Advertising, and then have applied a
“holding company discount”. Book Value/Share $123
Source: Pivotal Research Group and Company
We believe you could nitpick our approach to international GMV. That said, we believe: Documents
1) The company remains in aggressive investment mode – particularly in India – and suspect
this market alone is a large % of the international losses
Important Disclosures Are Located In The Appendix

2) Based on our channel work, we are of the view that most of the Western European markets
are doing MSD % OI margins
3) Unlike China, which was a guaranteed unwinnable fight for AMZN relative to Chinese
natives like JD, and BABA, there was a zero-probability chance the Chinese government would
allow ecommerce to be dominated by a foreign player.
4) By comparison, we think the Indian government is way more foreign business friendly, and
valuing the company on retail OI (god knows how many assumptions you need to make to
come up w a clean retail OI number) would attribute no value to international revenues.
 We would advocate the investors should essentially look at the business in two primary
buckets: AWS and Everything Else
 So why do we think so? AMZN is probably the company that penned the term
“Flywheel” or certainly made it pervasive in the investment and operating
communities. What do we mean? Let’s start to dissect by reporting line.
 Retail - The 1p and 3p businesses, while with different margin structures – 3p is
much higher and reported only as the net take, are intimately intertwined. They
benefit from the same end-customer base. With FBA’s continued expansion and
penetration as a % of the 3P business, they often share the same warehouse space,
as well as the same logistics/delivery providers. They share the same payment
processing and benefit from the same marketing. We have long put zero stock in
trying to look at one vs. the other. FBA increasing as % of the mix is good for retail
margins and AMZN’s take rate, but to our SOTP comment, we are not going to try
and put a different multiple on one vs. the other.
 Subscription – Prime – Sweet Sweet AMZN Prime. While we get that investors
love subscription businesses because they are sticky, recurring, and have much
greater degrees of predictability, AMZN Prime is all about the flywheel. There may
be a small base of Audible users or more on the come with its recent Luna Cloud
gaming service announcement, but end of the day the subscription business at
19.2bn in 2019 is all about Prime.
 Back to our Flywheel comment, the Prime business exists because of the
robust selection, and value proposition it represents to end consumers.
And to further sweeten the deal, AMZN over the last 5-7 years has only
further increased the value of a prime subscription by including an
increasingly robust offering of streaming video, streaming audio and most
recently, 1-day shipping.
 On the other side of the “network effect”, the larger the Prime subscriber
base, the more enfranchised sellers are in participating in AMZN’s FBA
(Fulfillment by Amazon) program. Having the “Prime Enabled” logo next to
your item, is a key driver to a shopper’s propensity to click. So back to our
comments about Retail, Prime and Retail are intimately intertwined. Within
that context, we think ascribing a value to Subscription in SOTP separately
also makes no sense
 Advertising – As we have framed in our earlier notes about AMZN’s ad business, 1)
We think they are the only online player really benefiting from trade budgets today,
2) We believe there was an evolution internally in which AMZN found the right
advertising business for AMZN.
 We estimate at least 85-90% of the AMZN business today is sponsored
listings. In this scenario, an advertiser pays for higher placement within the
product sort order, the user stays on AMZN, and AMZN keeps the
transaction and transaction data.
 To use CPG as an example (we think by far the largest advertiser vertical
on AMZN), we think P&G, Unilever, Energizer - companies that don’t have
a real DTC strategy -view advertising on AMZN to be not so different than
paying for favorable shelf placement at WMT, TGT, KR, etc. The reality is,
this is a) where their customers are, b) has better quantifiable results than
the offline analog, so have been happy participants.
 We think that AMZN could become more aggressive with AMZN
Fire/potentially giving the TV device away to further drive their video
inventory, but think that this hasn’t happened yet (but who knows – prime
day is around the bend), but a development worth closely watching.
 Similar to Retail and Prime, we think investors have potentially thought
through the Ad business as being a separate business unit, but we think
that it sits under the broader retail umbrella to a greater degree than
investors recognize. The ad business doesn’t exist without retail.
 So why does this all matter? Let’s do a little fun math. 1) FY 2015 North America margin was
4.3%, international was (0.3%) 2) The FY 2015 Other revenue line in totality was $1.7bn (with
advertising likely $1.2-1.3bn), 3) Street estimated GAAP EBIT is ~$69bn for 2024
 In our view, 2016 was the year advertising had the real break out - with Other
revenues growing 74% y/y and advertising growing, we estimate, ~90% y/y.
 For context, our estimate of advertising was $13.8bn in 2019, growing 41% y/y to
~19.4bn in 2020.
 Now this is where it gets interesting – based on our channel work, and some
common sense, we estimate that advertising EBIT margins (if it were a stand-
alone) are north of 80%, and believe that could even be CONSERVATIVE.
 Running this math based on 2019 actuals, Non-AWS EBIT was $5.3bn, and

Advertising if looked in isolation would be ~$11bn – implying that the rest of the
business is losing money??!?!?!?!?! We actually think of this as a huge positive not a
negative.
 As we stated under bullet 4, we think that there is AWS and Everything Else so we
look at advertising as another part of the Flywheel.
 Valuation is often more of an art-form than pure science, but end of the day what
matters is what is the underlying earnings potential of the business.
 In our view, we think the key exercise for valuing AMZN, is to do is the following:
 Take AWS Revenues and EBIT estimates for 2024 (newly published
today) – we are at ~$100bn in revenues and $34.5bn in OI
 Assume the “stand-alone” advertising business does $52bn and an
estimated margin of 75% (let’s assume they do more around CTV/Fire
TV so the margin goes down from predominantly sponsored
products, that is $39bn!
 So combined, between these two lines, we are already at $73.5bn in EBIT
 If we assume that the non-ad components of the north American retail biz
are able to get back to a 4% EBIT margin as they were in 2015 (North
America was 4.3%), we would get on our estimates of retail revenues of
19.5bn
 All in, this is $93bn of EBIT “Earnings Power” vs the street at $69bn – 14% EBIT
margins vs the street at ~10%
 Assuming we are correct, by 2024 investors won’t need to do these financial
acrobatics, because the underlying report EBIT of the busines will show up flowing
through the income statement.
 Let’s entertain the negative side and see where we could be wrong. Do you mean to say
AMZN is back to its old days of selling things at a loss? And don’t they always find a way to
keep spending? Well yes and no.
 We think this comparison to 2015 margins is a decent proxy to think through earnings power,
and are expect international EBIT will be positive by then as well. We do see a few big step
function potential costs that are worth framing, and want to discuss where our logic could be
wrong.
 There has been a huge amount of incremental investment into the business with
fulfillment having slowed in 19/18 in terms of order of magnitude y/y dollar growth
pretty substantially – we think there is a massive step up this year
 Content costs – a straight up gross margin headwind have increased substantially
and potentially could again
 We actually think a more logical owner of things like NFL rights at the next
round of negotiations is more likely to be AMZN, AAPL or GOOG relative
to the current rights holders as we suspect we have hit a negative
inflection point with linear viewing/cable subscribers. We also think that the
potential for one of these tech companies, who each have MASSIVE
international audiences to have a big impact on the league’s international
presence and brand would likely only further drive this – this would be a
huge step up in content costs
 One day shipping evolves into same day shipping – as we have been writing about
since initiating on AMZN last year, we have viewed one day shipping as a step along
the road on the way to inevitable same day shipping – a clear incremental driver of
incremental cost headwinds.
 The grocery category is clearly one of the last uncaptured categories of huge TAM-
particularly in the US. We think that the elements of fresh product, different fulfillment
center needs (in part because of perishable), are subscale at this point. But would
highlight that 1) we think Bezos’ world view is that he wants AMZN to own as large a
percent of the consumers wallet as possible – if they dominate in grocery, they will
have largely achieved that, 2) groceries are arguably to last category within which
AMZN is not dominant, so see fewer negative new category introduction headwinds
and 3) we are assuming AMZN can ultimately get to a ~3-4% EBIT margin in grocery
at scale.
 Logistics? – we have been of the view for several years, that AMZN has ambitions to
compete with FDX/UPS in the top US cities/where they have the most density. We
think investors have been paying for some of these investments “along the way”, and
think that AMZN has pulled back mid-Covid from their intentions to compete with the
third-party carriers, but think this is a function of necessity given the incredible high
level of demand for all eCommerce companies. We would be shocked if AMZN is not
in market well in advance of 2024 – pricing below their peers. Overall, we think this
competitive push would be a headwind to EBIT, but would be favorably viewed as a
new leg of the AMZN story.
 The ad business is more mature than we appreciate. We think that the ad biz grows
correlated with GMV and while we have estimated GMV growth of 13% in 2024, and
ad growth at 20%, potentially we are overestimating the headroom in the business.
 In summary, we think that most of these potential large pockets of investment (ex-fulfillment
build-out) would likely be seen as incremental drivers of revenue growth, so to the extent EBIT
numbers are too high, we would suspect the revenue numbers are likely too low.
 AMZN long-term skeptics will respond to an analysis such as this that they always manage to
spend away the upside, but if grocery is in fact the last “frontier” category, we think they will

ultimately run out of large incremental “big ticket” investment opportunities and the underlying
earnings power of the business will flow through.



WHERE WE COULD BE WRONG: 1) AWS continues to slow faster than we expect, 2) 3rd party fees at 26.7% for 2018 (we model
their exit run rate for Q4 at 27.3%) see material pressure. AMZN began reducing some fees over the last 2 months - we are nervous
that they could actually be way too high, but don’t know how to handicap magnitude, 3) offline retail is able to strike back harder
than we appreciate – we are surprised WMT already had its wheels in motion in terms of a response 4) we are underestimating the
size of the investment cycle. Incremental investment for one-day is impacting shipping costs – if they really want to get this right, it
could be a material investment in fulfillment too.
RISKS: 1) Over saturation of AMZN within eCommerce, 2) macro-economic deceleration causes greater than expected declines in
commerce, 3) AWS slows materially, and 4) anti-trust action.

Bernanke’s Mississippi Bubble Stock? Part III
Analyst’s Notes....Continued
• At the time of our initial report (July 24, 2017), Amazon was valued at $1025.67 while BTC traded at $2779 or a ratio of .369. We had a
price target of .04 BTC, $640, or .11 gold oz which implied a BTC price of $16,000, a gold price of $5800, or a decline in Amazon’s
share price in USD. We point this out given that our initial BTC target was surpassed in December 2017. Based on today’s level of
monetary insanity we have a BTC target of $20,568 and a gold price target of $6,652. At today’s BTC price of $9,500.71 the ratio of
Amazon’s share price to BTC is .201 and while Amazon’s share price to gold ratio is roughly 1.42.
• Fintrust Brokerage Services is raising our Sell rating to Hold, and we are raising our nominal price target price from $1,111 current
USD to $1,611 on the basis of our dividend discount model and current interest rates. Our target prices relative to BTC is .078 and our
gold relative target is .24 gold ounces in our real purchasing power price estimates. This represents 15.7% nominal downside from today’s
price of $1,911.
• As repeatedly stated in our reports, our estimates are naturally wide given we are in the midst of the largest money debasement in a
“Western” country, since John Law in 1720 or the German hyperinflation of 1914-1923. Our valuation calculations under various
scenarios range from a low of $1170 to a high $2550 per share in current USD. The wide range of estimates is the natural outgrowth the
company’s high growth rates and historically low interest rates. Discounted cash flow models for high growth companies in a negative to
near zero interest rate environment return nearly infinite prices for the value of an equity that invests cash today and promises cash
tomorrow because cash today has nearly no value, while cash later, if it materializes, has potentially large value.
• Using Valueline, we calculate that Amazon has realized a 10-year historical growth rate in equity of 28%. In addition to our own analysis,
we used Valueline’s 2020 earnings estimate of $35.60 and projected cashflows forward for 20 years and then discount those earnings
back at 6% and added this sum to Valueline’s estimated 2019 book value estimate ($131.55) to derive a fair value estimate of $2,011. At
the current $1,911 per share price, we estimate that the market is discounting Amazon’s like a 20-year monopoly that will sustain a 16%
growth rate.
• While we understand the market’s pricing for AMZN, we continue to note that one of history’s other great trading, logistics and information
monopolies, the Dutch East India company, realized returns of 18% for 200 years, after being granted a 21-year monopoly, but its earnings
and dividends were irregular in amount and form. In addition, we note that the company’s stock price reached a record low dividend yield
of 3.5% and record stock price high of just over $1100 per share, during the period that coincided with the peak insanity of John Law’s
monetary system in 1720. Using Valueline’s 2020, $70.25 per share cashflow estimate for each Amazon.com share and dividing by 3.5%
we derive a $2007 price. Importantly for price targets, Amazon.com retains its earnings, whereas the Dutch East India Company
distributed its earnings (source: globalfinancialdata.com), as a result, the share price, book value, and our estimates of fair value would
be expected to continue to increase over time.
Co nclusion, Recommendation & Risk
Ou r conclusion, recommendation and risk assessment remain the same as in our previous reports.
As rec orded by Washington Irving, John Law’s “System” eventually collapsed as “capitalist gradually awoke from their bewilderment” in
the system which was designed to “depreciate the value of gold and increase the illusive credit of paper.” As a result of this
awakening, Law was forced to reduce the value of the bank’s notes by one-half and the shares of CDO fell from 9000 to 5000 livres.
While the bank notes were restored to their full value, Irving reports that “government itself had lost all public confidence equally with
the bank.” (any chance of a collapse in political confidence or confidence in the central banks?).
In turn, this failing of confidence in government, led to a massive hyperinflation as paper money was refused. Irving reports
that jewels, precious stones, plate, porcelain, trinkets of gold and silver, all commanded any price, in paper while land was bought at
fifty years’ purchase….Monopolies now became the rage among the noble holders of paper” (got your FANG stocks?) Law was forced
to flee France and Irving quotes Voltaire as saying, “He was a quack to whom the state was given to be cured, but who poisoned it with
his drugs, and who poisoned himself.”
We can name a few bankers worthy of such modern praise. Should they be so bold as to read this report, we would encourage
them to read The Great Disorder by Feldman and to remember that economist used to also be moral philosophers. When you devalue
money and remove its ability to act as a store of value – you devalue the man who prudently saved and you steal from him the excess
of his labors – as periods of hyperinflation have repeatedly shown, once a man has been devalued economically, it is a short step to his

devaluation physically. It is not the moral obligation of the central bank to finance every bad political idea. The proper moral role of the
central bank is to lend against good collateral at high rates of interest during times of economic stress, not finance anything, anywhere,
at any time at low rates of interest. If central bankers no longer hold themselves accountable, our analysis of history suggests that they
might eventually and rightfully be driven from the country under the threat of tar and feathers.

We performed a DCF evaluation of AMZN based on our 10-year forward earnings forecast, which is summarized in the preceding table.
Our key assumptions are that (1) AMZN’s Cost of Capital is 8.0% and that (2) the Company’s discounted Terminal Value is driven by an
assumption of 23.0% ongoing revenue growth. Our model indicates that the shares’ target price is $1,611 or % downside. As the following
Share Price Matrix illustrates, the target price is sensitive to very modest changes in WACC or perpetual unlevered free cash flow
growth rate assumptions.

iPhone—Intra-Quarter Data Points Leave us to Est. ~54-57M iPhones
Shipped in F2Q22; Blended ASP ($/unit) and 3rd-gen iPhone SE Ramp in
Focus
Based on our proprietary data analysis / Wells Fargo iPhone index, we think Apple shipped ~54-58
million iPhones during F2Q22; est. iPhone revenue in the range of $44-$48 billion. We consider
intra-quarter iPhone-related data points as net-neutral vs. our maintaining F2Q22 iPhone revenue /
shipment at $47.416B / 57.47M (vs. street at $48.345B / 57.41M). We expect investors to be
focused on commentary around any weakening of consumer demand, especially in China, as well as
improvement around the company's supply chain. We will be focused on ASP uplift from the iPhone 13
lineup as well as commentary around the rollout of the company's 3rd-gen iPhone SE ($429 starting
price; launched on March 8th).
Hardware Subscription Oering? We hope to hear more detail on Apple's reported plans to oer a
subscription service for its hardware products by the end of 2022. Investors should be positive on any
move toward a subscription hardware model with added recurring revenue and potential for a higher
proportion of newer iPhones driving pull-thru revenue for wearables such as the upcoming AR/VR
headsets. We would note Apple's November '21 launch of Apple Business Essentials for SMBs, which is
designed for SMBs of up to 500 employees and packages device management, support, and iCloud
storage into subscription plans.
We would highlight mixed / neutral data points below with strong U.S. smartphone imports and
relatively weak China mobile phone shipment data.
U.S. Smartphone Imports
February U.S. trade data implied a continued positive trend for January + February in terms of
smartphone imports with imports to the U.S. totaling $10.819 billion, +35% y/y. February imports of
smartphones totaled $4.251 billion, +21% y/y. On a unit basis combined January + February imports
were 28.272 million, -3% y/y. Smartphone imports from China, which we have seen represent the
highest historical correlation with Apple’s iPhone shipments, are +25% y/y on a US$ basis in Jan + Feb;
units are +12% y/y.

Services—Solid Double-Digit Growth to Continue
We are modeling F2Q22 services revenue at $20.101B or up +19% y/y and +3% q/q (vs. Street est. at
$19.728B, +17% y/y). We continue to believe that Apple will maintain subscription growth momentum
despite the end of COVID lockdowns with potential for a positive mix shift driving further margin
upside. We model the number of Apple services subscriptions to expand to ~810 million exiting
F2Q22, up in the low to mid-20% range y/y following several quarters of high-20% growth. We
estimate that Apple will reach ~960M subscriptions exiting F2023.
We will also be focused on Alphabet's Distribution Partner TAC (Trac Acquisition Costs) when the
company reports on 4/26 AMC. These payments to Apple have historically been highly correlated with
Apple's Services revenue.

Mac / iPad
We expect Apple to report positive Mac results following share gains in Gartner and IDC preliminary
1Q22 PC shipment data. We are modeling Mac revenue at $9.011B (Street: $9.094B) and iPad
revenue at $7.135B (Street: $7.208B). Gartner 1Q22 preliminary PC shipment data (sell-through)
estimated Apple shipments at 7.005M units, up 8.6% y/y compared to an industry-wide decline of
7.3% driven by its M1-based processor lineup. Apple saw even stronger growth in the United States
where Mac shipments were up 18.6% y/y (-9.1% q/q) compared to a market-wide decline of 16.5%. We
continue to be positive on Apple's ability to pick up share in the PC market, especially the commercial
market, as its high-performance M1 processors give the company an edge. We will also be focused
on any easing of the iPad's supply chain following commentary that it was severely constrained last
quarter.
At the same time, we think it is clear that the PC market is beginning to slow / enter a digestion phase.
Taiwanese notebook ODMs and component suppliers continue to report low visibility into 2Q22 but
with Quanta expecting 2Q22 notebook shipments to increase q/q; Compal expecting shipments to
increase in the high-single digit or double-digit q/q range (vs. -20% q/q in 1Q22) and Wistron and
Inventec are forecasting shipments to increase in the single digits q/q in 2Q22.

Wearables
We are modeling Apple's Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment at $9.335B compared to the
consensus estimate at $8.711B. We have seen conicting reports about Apple moving to cut orders
for its AirPods in 2Q22 (DigiTimes citing a 20M unit reduction in 2022). We expect broader availability
of Series 7 watches and AirPods 3 to continue to drive growth in F2022. We model F2022 Wearables
revenue at $45.41B (+18% y/y) vs. the consensus estimate at $43.19B.

AMAZON EARNINGS PREVIEW: ANOTHER LOSS
Haiku: Amazon sold us, a kindle fire tablet, for thirty dollars. PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART
Shares of AMZN are up over 10% since the company reported March quarter earnings, trading
close to the 52-week high of $493.20 reached on July 20th, 2015. Investors remain enthusiastic
on the growing Prime ecosystem, and the fast-growing Amazon Web Service (AWS) that showed
surprisingly strong profitability when the company first started breaking it out in the March
quarter. Regarding AWS, we mention that the nature of this business is high volume, low margin.
This is a business driven by price decreases, and looking back just two quarters one can see that
the segment margin was 8.4%, a much lower level that the recently reported 16.9%. Investors
who expect AWS margin to continue to improve may be disappointed.
We estimate revenue for the June quarter to be $22B, which is growth of 9% YoY. Our revenue
estimate is in line with the consensus estimate. Our loss per share estimate of $0.20 compares to
Source: marketwatch.com
earnings per share of $0.27 in the prior year and a loss of $0.12 in the prior quarter and below
the consensus loss per share estimate of $0.14. Earnings are Thursday post-market.
North America: We expect revenue from the North America segment to be at $13B in the
quarter for 59% of total, +19% YoY growth and segment operating income of $525M. We
expect Media to grow in North America at +17% YoY for 22% of North American revenue and
EGM (electronics and other general merchandise) revenue to grow at 20% YoY, accounting for
77% of North American revenue.
International: We expect revenue from International segment to be $8B in the quarter with a
growth of 3% YoY growth. We expect Media revenue to grow at 2% YoY to provide 32% of
total, and EGM to grow at 3% YoY providing 67% of International revenue.
AWS :We expect revenue from company’s Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business is
expected to be $1.6B, for 7% of total revenue and growth of 53% YoY.
Company Data
Media & EGM: We expect worldwide Media revenue to grow at 10% YoY to $5B for 24% of
total revenue. Electronics and Other General Merchandise (EGM) revenue estimated at $15B, Price ($) 487.25
+14% YoY growth. This segment is the growth engine for the company and expected to account 52-Week Range ($) 284.00-493.20
for 68% of total revenue.

Estimates and Valuation
We adjust our 2015 estimates to:
$0.47 in GAAP EPS and $102.1B in net revenue.
From
$0.57 in GAAP EPS and $102.1B in net revenue.
Our estimates compare to consensus of $0.47 in EPS and $103.2B in revenue.
Our 2016 remains unchanged estimates at:
$2.74 in GAAP EPS and $117.5B in net revenue.
Our estimates compare to consensus of $2.78 in EPS and $121.9B in revenue.
Our FY16 revenue estimates represents a growth of 15% YoY, and EPS YoY growth of 478% and Operating Margin
estimate at 2%
Based on our $2.74 estimate for calendar 2016 EPS and using a 173x multiple, we determine a 12-month price target of
$475 for AMZN. Our prior target was $425. We maintain our HOLD rating on shares of Amazon Inc.
Risks
Competition: Amazon faces competition from various industries like retail, e-commerce services, digital and web
services. These competitors have longer histories, greater resources and brand recognition and more customers, and are
capable of adopting aggressive pricing, securing better terms from vendors and employing more resources for
technology, fulfillment and marketing.
Expansion: The company is witnessing significant expansion in its global operations which has increased the complexity
of the business. This expansion also leads to strain on management, growth, financial, operational and other resources
and also subjects the company to additional legal, financial and business risks.
Fulfillment Centers: It is very important for the company to predict customer demand and optimize and operate its
fulfillment centers successfully, otherwise it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity,
increased costs and impairment charges. This could harm the business.
Seasonality: The seasonal nature of the business puts a strain on the operations of the company. A net sale in the
fourth quarter is disproportionate which leads to inventory, gross profits, net shipping costs and accounts payable being
adversely affected.
Foreign Exchange Risk: The company has significant foreign exchange risk associated with its international websites,
which affects operating results. Further expansion in international operations increases exposure to exchange rate
fluctuations.
For additional risks, see the AMZN 10-K filing with the SEC.

 Revenue Guidance As Low As Feared. No Change To
Joseph Galone Apple EPS Est Or Target Thanks To Lower Tax Rate

• We are not changing our 2018 CY EPS estimate of $12.00 or price

target of $198 as a lower tax rate assumption of 15% vs prior estimate
of 19% was offset by lower gross margin estimates and lower
contribution from Other income and expenses.
• As we previewed in our note last week (Link), FQ2 revenue guidance
was $60 billion compared to a consensus estimate of $68 billion just a
week ago. The consensus estimate implied a sequential rise in ASP in
FQ2, but CFO Luca Maestri poured cold water on that theory during
the call. We now estimate a 6.5% q/q decline in ASP in FQ2 versus our
AAPL $167.78
prior estimate of a 3.9% decline and yet CFO Luca Maestri appeared to
12 month target $198.00 be guiding to an even lower ASP.
U pside 18.0%
BUY ""For ASPs, there's also another element that we need to consider. As you
know, our newest products this year have higher ASPs than they had in
52 week range $128.53 - $179.26
the past. And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest
Dividend Yield 1.2% products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline
Market Cap (m) $869,702 sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced
historically."" -Luca Maestri, Apple CFO, 2/1/18, FQ1 2018 conference call

• Consensus numbers will be coming down for Apple, but as we suggested last
week, Apple still generates impressive revenue growth. We estimate 15% in
the March quarter and 10% for the Calendar year.
• Based on CFO Luca Maestri's comments, it appears that Apple added 4.2
million iPhones into the channel. Its highest quarterly inventory addition ever.
""We exited the December quarter towards the lower end of our target range of 5
to 7 weeks of iPhone channel inventory, with less than 1 million more iPhones in
the channel compared to the December quarter a year ago, in line with our
growth in average weekly unit sales."" -Luca Maestri, Apple CFO, 2/1/18, FQ1 2018
conference call

• The $796 iPhone ASP was higher than we expected in the quarter. Here is our
best guess on unit mix.
▪ Versus our estimate going into the quarter.
▪ As a result, we are bumping up our FQ2 iPhone ASP by $25 to $745 and
lowering our unit estimate by 1 million to 52 million, which lifts our FQ2 total
revenue estimate by $500 million to $60.9 billion, the mid-point of the
guidance range of $60-$62 billion.
▪ We increased our Calendar 2018 revenue estimate by $700 million. A $2.0
billion increase to iPhone revenue (on higher ASP assumptions) was partially
offset by lower estimates for Mac unit sales and services revenue. It's notable
that we are cutting Services revenue and that growth was under 20% despite
the focus of this line item early in the call. We cut some unit growth from our
iPhone expectations, but expect low single digit unit growth each quarter.
▪ The weak guidance for FQ2 gross margins caused us to cut our GM estimate
for Calendar 2018 by 70 basis points to 38.3%, a 10 basis point contraction from
2017.
▪ We bumped up our R&D estimate by $700 million for the year. It grew 19% this
quarter and regularly outpaces our estimates. We expect R&D to represent
5.3% of revenue in Calendar 2018, up from 2.8% in Calendar 2013. No one on
the call asked about what the R&D priorities are, but we did get a lengthy
description of the HomePod, even though Other Products represented 6.0% of
revenue in Calendar 2017.
BTIG LLC Walter Piecyk  www.btigresearch.com

▪ Our Calendar 2018 EPS estimate would have been cut to $11.44 from $12.00 if
the company had not guided to the 15% tax rate versus our 19% estimate.
▪ Share repurchase finally rose to $10 billion and we expect it to stay at those
levels in future quarters in order to hit our target.
""Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital structure for our
company. Our current net cash position is $163 billion, and given the increased
financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are
targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time. We will provide an
update to our specific capital allocation plans when we report results for our
second fiscal quarter, consistent with the timing of updates that we had provided
in the past."" -Luca Maestri, Apple CFO, 2/1/18, FQ1 2018 conference call
▪ Our $10 billion estimate of quarterly share repurchase might be prove to be
too low based on CFO Luca Maestri's comments above. If Apple bought $15
billion of stock back each quarter it would lift our $12.00 EPS estimate up to
$12.19.
▪ Tables that compare our estimate revisions are below.

APPLE INC INITIATION
REVENUE Figure 1: Service revenue breakdown
Apple has five revenue segments: iPhone (50% of sales), Mac (10%), iPad (9%), Wearables,
Home and Accessories (11%), and Services (20%). The first four are grouped under products.
Wearables, home and accessories consist of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats
products, HomePod, iPod touch and other Apple-branded and third-party accessories.
Services are licensing, App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iTunes.
Service revenue grew by a 17% CAGR from FY16 to FY20 to double from 9% to 20% of total
revenue (Figure 3). iPhone revenue was flat in the same period but is expected to surge in
FY21 and FY22.

EXPENSES
Cost of sales grew at a 5% CAGR from FY16 to FY20, in line with its revenue CAGR of 5%.
Operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses (7% of sales) and
research and development (7%). Over the past five years, SG&A consistently ranged at 6-7%
of sales, while R&D grew from 5% to 7% of sales. Total operating expenses grew at a 8%
CAGR.
MARGINS
Gross margins averaged 38% in the past five years. Margins for services averaged 61% in the
past four years, almost double the product margins of 33%. We forecast elevated margins
for both services and products for FY21 and FY22 on the back of higher ASPs of new 5G
devices and a higher installed base for services boosting operating leverage. Normalisation
of freight costs could jack up product margins further.
BALANCE SHEET
Assets: Fixed assets increased modestly by 36% in the past five years to US$37bn, roughly
in line with revenue growth of 27% between FY16 to FY20. Fixed assets only comprised 8%
of total assets as Apple outsources most of its manufacturing needs. Inventory grew 90% in
the past five years to US$4bn, likely due to Apple’s wider range of product line-ups in recent
years.
Liabilities: Net debt averaged US$19bn in the past five years. It was pared down to lower
levels in FY19 and FY20 as fixed assets were flat in those years.
CASH-FLOW
Apple historically generates strong cash flows every year. Cash flow from operations in FY20
jumped 16% YoY to US$81bn from a strong iPhone 12 launch. Much of the cash was used
for stock repurchases of US$72bn in that year. Meanwhile, capex averaged US$11bn in the
last five years, largely stable.

BUSINESS MODEL Recent product launches
Apple designs, makes and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables iPhone 12 with 5G
and accessories, and sells a variety of related services. Customers are primarily in the
consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets.
Apple sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its markets directly to
customers through retail and online stores and a direct sales force. It also distributes
indirectly through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.
FY20 net sales through direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 34% and 66%,
respectively, of total net sales. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales
in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Main markets are the Americas (45% of FY20 sales), Europe (25%),
Greater China (15%), Japan (8%), and the rest of Asia Pacific (7%).
In the service segment, the main revenue contributor is the App Store, which takes in 30% iMac with new M1 chip
of revenue from in-app purchases of games, app sales, and app subscriptions. Next is
licensing, which includes payments from companies like Google to be featured on Apple
products. Other services include AppleCare, which is Apple’s extended warranty service with
a price range that depends on the product. iCloud generates revenue through subscription
fees for use of cloud data. Apple Music also generates subscription fees as well as revenue
from carrier partnerships. Apple Pay earns a percentage of transaction fees from users and
banks. New to services and not yet meaningfully contributing are Apple TV, which earns
subscription fees, and Apple Card, where Apple likely takes a cut of the interest charged by
its partner bank.

INDUSTRY
The high-end smartphone market is predominantly served by Apple and Samsung. Huawei
has fallen out of the ranks following U.S. sanctions. Apple’s share of global smartphone sales
averaged 14% in the past three years, hitting a historical high of 21% in 4Q20 on the back of
the iPhone 12 launch (Figure 8). The International Data Corporation (IDC) expects the global
smartphone market to grow at a 3.6% CAGR over 2020-2025 (Figure 6). Apple’s key markets,
China (18% of sales) and the US (45%), are forecast to grow 6.0% and 3.5% respectively.
Despite tepid market growth, Apple can rely on its consistently growing ecosystem of
installed users to outperform the market. The iPhone’s installed base breached 1bn in 2020
(Figure 9), growing by a stronger 5-year CAGR of 7% than the pre-pandemic smartphone
sales CAGR of 2%. Most iPhones are sold to upgraders in its installed base (Figure 7).

Risks
1. Antitrust laws could affect service revenue. Apple could lower its App Store fees for larger developers as a result of lawsuits.
Apple last year lowered its fee to 15% for smaller developers making less than US$1mn per year from their apps. But App Store
revenue is largely driven by its larger developer base, contributing 30% fees.
2. China’s gaming crackdown could hit App Store spending. China’s gaming revenue contributed an estimated US$2bn or 13% to
App Store revenue in FY19. That said, even if China’s gaming crackdown intensifies, we believe the impact will be minimal as
China’s gaming revenue translated to less than 1% of FY19 revenue.
3. Chip supply shortage. Apple guided for a US$3-4bn of impact from chip shortages earlier this year. This will affect iPhone and
iPad sales in the coming quarter. There is a risk of the impact coming in at the higher end of the range.

Managing supply chain and FX headwinds well
UNITED STATES | CONSUMER | 3Q22 RESULTS 3 August 2022
 3Q22 revenue and PATMI in line with expectations. 9M22 revenue/PATMI at 77/80% of
our FY22e forecasts.
 Record iPhone revenue for June quarter, with growing installed base and increasing
customer engagement driving Services growth.
 Gross margins slightly above forecasts, demonstrating Apple’s ability to better manage
supply chain constraints.
 We adjust our FY22e earnings forecasts upwards slightly to reflect higher gross margins
and PATMI outperformance YTD. We expect Apple to weather the supply chain
constraints and 6% FX headwind. We maintain BUY recommendation with a higher
target price of US$198.00 (prev. US$194.00) on DCF with a WACC of 6.1% and terminal
growth of 3.0%.
Results at a glance
The Positives
+ Record revenue for iPhone and Services. AAPL reported record sales from its iPhones for
3Q22 – US$63.4bn (3% YoY), with customer satisfaction and brand loyalty at an all-time high.
There were also a record number of people switching to iPhones in the quarter. The
company also mentioned no obvious macroeconomic impact on iPhone sales in the quarter
besides FX. Services also set records for the quarter across both developed and emerging
markets, up 12% YoY overall despite almost 5% FX headwinds, supported by a growing
customer installed base, and increasing customer engagement.
+ Gross margins slightly above forecasts. AAPL recorded gross margins of 43.3%, slightly
above consensus forecasts, demonstrating its ability to manage supply chain constraints
better despite COVID-related factory shutdowns in China, and increasing FX headwinds.
Products gross margin was down almost 1.5% YoY to 34.5%, while Services gross margin up
1.7% YoY to 71.5%.
The Negatives
- Supply constraints and FX to impact revenue growth. A couple of headwinds are likely to
continue from 2Q22 into 3Q22. For Products, AAPL expects supply constraints to continue,
although at slightly lower levels compared to 2Q22 – affecting Product margins. A
strengthening US dollar relative to most other currencies is also likely to provide
approximately 6% of negative headwinds for revenue growth.

APPLE INC Update
Outlook
Supply chain constraints will ease, and strength of the US dollar will continue to hurt
margins. AAPL expects 3Q22 revenue growth to accelerate compared to 2Q22, despite FX
headwinds. The company also guided gross margins between 41.5% and 42.5%, with
operating expenses of US$12.9bn-13.1bn.
Figure 1: Guidance summary for AAPL vs PSR
Demand for AAPL products is likely to remain resilient, with customers switching over to
iPhones. At the same time, more than half of the customers who purchased its other
products – Mac, iPad, Wearables, were new to the product, a trend we expect to continue
moving forward, especially with the new M2 chip release and new iPhone release later this
year.
A growing installed base of AAPL users across all regions and product categories is also
supporting the expansion in Services, with transacting accounts, paid accounts, and paid
subscriptions all showing double digit YoY growth – creating a flywheel effect.
Maintain BUY with a higher TP of US$198.00 (prev. US$194.00)
Even with near-term headwinds, we are adjusting our FY22e PATMI forecasts upwards
slightly to reflect higher gross margins, and the outperformance for 1H22. We maintain BUY
and our target price of US$198.00 (prev. US$194.00) on DCF with a WACC of 6.1% and
terminal growth of 3.0%.

Holiday eComm Update
Sales Tracking +17% vs. Our +18% Projection; Cyber
Monday Pricing More Competitive - ALERT
Latest thoughts on Holiday eComm and key takeaways from our updated
Internet
proprietary pricing survey:
Doug Anmuth AC
(1-212) 622-6571
1) Holiday online sales tracking ~17% thus far–Cyber Monday at +16.8% Y/Y and

Thanksgiving &Black Fridayin the 17%-18% rangeaccording to Adobe–and largely
BloombergJPMA ANMUTH <GO>
in-line with our +18% Y/Y estimate. According to comScore, US desktop retail
Ashwin Kesireddy
eCommerce spending for Thanksgiving and Black Friday grew 22% & 20%,
(1-415) 315-6756
respectively. Other notable takeaways from Adobe include: a) overall web traffic to 
retail sites was up 11.9% (vs. season avg. +5.7%) & mobile represents a new record of Cory A Carpenter
47.4% of visits & 33.1% of revenues; b)during November 23 through 26,online sales (1-212) 270-8125
totaled $13.03B, +14.4% Y/Y; c)Thanksgiving Day spend totaled $2.87 billion (18.3 
percent growth YoY) while Black Friday hit $5.03 billion (up 16.9 percent YoY); d) Dae K Lee
Thanksgiving weekend (November 25 and 26) saw $5.12 billion in revenue; and e) (1-212) 622-5673

online spend surpassed at least $1 billion every day in the lead up to Thanksgiving.

2) AMZN remained the overall price leader in 4 of 9 categories we tracked (1-212) 622-2630

heading into Cyber Monday, but competitors’ price delta vs. AMZN narrowed
Christopher Horvers, CFA
more after Black Friday. AMZN led pricing in theBaby, Sporting,Toys,and Beauty
(1-212) 622-1316
categories, while TGT (covered by JPM’s Chris Horvers), WMT (covered by JPM’s

Chris Horvers) and Specialty stores offered higher discounts in other categories.

(1-212) 622-0359

3) Discounts increased into Cyber Monday. We looked at 110 items across 9
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
categories and tracked them across AMZN, WMT, TGT,and across a specialty player
in each category. Of the 110 items, 9 items were either unlisted or were‘out of stock’
on various websites for Cyber Monday. We believe ‘out of stock’ indicates healthy
demand for those itemsover the weekend,but it also becomes a problem if customers
cannot get what they want (Please see Tables 2 through 10 for more details). Of the
remaining 101 items, pricing overall had decreased over the last 10 days w/AMZN
pricing dropping -3% vs. -8% for TGT, -5% for WMT, and -7% for Specialty. We note
that the price delta vs. AMZN has narrowed to 0% from 2% for WMT, 0% vs.5% for
Specialty segment, and Target offered higher discounts during Cyber Monday than
AMZN.Wewould also note that during the holiday seasonextending through the end
of the year, products often come in and out of stock & pricing may change.
4) AMZN’s lead. Our survey suggests AMZN was the overall pricing leader offering
the lowest prices in 4 of our 9 baskets. While this may optically look unfavorable after
having offered lowest prices in 7 out of 9 baskets heading into Black Friday, we
believe that less price aggression after Black Friday indicatesstrong online demand at
the retailer over the weekend. We remain optimistic on AMZN's performance this
holiday season.We note that Specialty stores have dropped pricing materially as their
premium vs. AMZN declined from 5% on Nov 16 to prices now that almost match
AMZN.

Flipkart and Walmex. On a two-year basis we estimate SSS accelerated to +16.8%
from +13.7% in 2Q (+8.9% in 1Q). Comp sales outpaced inflation in most markets Jessica Taylor

+11.7% at Walmex (transactions up +5.2%, ticket up +6.2%), 2) +5.6% in China
(transactions up +1.0%, ticket up +4.6%), and 3) +5.2% in Canada (transactions up Gabriella Carbone

Positive Comps and Transactions Across Geographies...
Walmex led international with net sales up +12.9%, a comp of +11.7%, driven by
food and consumables combined with 20 new doors opened in the quarter.
Specifically, in Mexico comps grew +11.1% with strength in Bodega and Sam's
Club. Both transactions and ticket were strong for Walmex, up +5.2% and +6.2%
respectively. China delivered net sales growth of +6.9%, a comp of +5.6% with
strength in Sam's Club and e-commerce. Transactions in China increased +1.0%
with ticket up +4.6%. Canada performance was also solid with sales growth of
+5.5% and a +5.2% comp, driven by strong transactions, up +5.8%, partially offset
by slightly negative ticket, down -0.5%. Canada saw sales in food and consumables
outpace sales in general merchandise.
...With Initiatives Bearing Fruit
Flipkart performed well in the quarter, with Big Billion Days moving into 3Q this year
from 4Q last year. The eight day event drove over 1B site visits with 60% from tier
2 and tier 3 cities, many shopping for the first time while Flipkart ads helped drive
the 30% global increase in advertising growth. PhonePe was strong in the quarter
with total payment volume, TPV, over $920B, with a record 3.6B monthly
transactions, translating to over 10B transactions for the quarter for the first time.
Mexico is driving performance through core sales and profit performance as well as
developing customer solutions through alternative businesses, including the Cashi
payments business, BAIT telecom, and the emerging healthcare business. Finally,
in October the company launched Walmart Fulfillment Services in Canada , which
will enable two-day shipping to 95% of Canadians.

Walmart Inc
E-commerce Continues to Show Strength
We continue to be encouraged by e-commerce strength in the international
segment, with 20% of sales initiated digitally, outpacing total company at 13%. E-
commerce sales penetration was up 400 bps vs. last year to 23% of net sales
(+18.2% contribution in 2Q) with Flipkart a key driver. China also leads in e-
commerce, with growth of +63% and penetration at 41%, almost double overall
international. Mexico e-commerce net sales were up +17%, +44 % on a two-year
basis while in Canada e-commerce sales were up +3%. +34% on a two-year basis.
And Inventories Are Well Managed
Inventory for the international segment was up +2.5% for the quarter, aided by a
currency tailwind, however the underlying inventory levels vs. last year have
reduced over the last three quarters and management is pleased with the current
in-stock levels as the segment laps late orders last year.
But Margins Are Under (Temporary) Pressure
3Q GPM decreased 131 bps (a sequential deceleration from down 18 bps in 2Q),
primarily driven by the timing of sales events, including Big Billion Days. Mix was
also a headwind, specifically growth in lower margin formats and channels of
Sam's Club as well as e-commerce in China. Walmex gross profit rate was relatively
flat, as supply chain efficiencies and new revenue streams in Mexico were offset by
price investments. Gross margin rates in China and Canada decreased, based on
mix impacts from growth in lower margin formats and e-commerce in China and
mix into food and consumables and higher shrink in Canada. Operating margins
levered (-136 bps) on strong sales, including the timing of sales events. Walmex
operating expense rate was relatively flat as savings were reinvested in strategic
priorities, while China and Canada saw decreases driven by leverage and
productivity.

JPM 4Q20 EPS Instant Insight
Stock Rating/Industry View: Overweight/Positive
Price Target: USD 164.00
Price (14-Jan-2021): USD 141.17
Potential Upside/Downside: 16%
Tickers: JPM
Bottom line
EPS was ahead of expectations, driven by a provision for credit losses at a net benefit of $1.9bn ($2.9bn of
net reserve releases and $1.1bn of NCOs), compared to expectations of a provision expense. Still,
revenues (fee income followed by net interest income) and expenses were both also better than
forecasted. Looking out, it guided up its 2021 net interest income expectations, though this will be
accompanied by expense growth (up 4%-plus). Of note, it kept its business line ROE targets (normalized
environment) unchanged.
Outlook
Net interest income: ~$55.5bn (was $54bn in 10-Q) for 2021 (up +$0.5bn from 2020) including ~$13.6bn in 1Q21
and $14bn+ in 4Q21
Expenses: $68bn-plus for 2021 (vs. $65.5bn in 2020, including $2.4bn of incremental investments (non-tech +$1.5bn,
tech +$0.9bn); said above $67bn prior
Share repurchase: it intends to begin share repurchase in 1Q21
Business Line targets
CCB - ROE of 25%+/- (NO CHANGE) and an overhead ratio of 50-55% in a normalized environment; Net charge-offs
expected to be higher in 2H21 vs. 1H21
CIB - ROE of ~16% (NO CHANGE), revenue of ~$43B, and an overhead ratio of 54%+/- in a normalized environment
CB - Revised long-term gross IB target of $4bn (from $3bn); Maintained long-term targets of $1bn each of expansion
market revenue and international revenue and ~18% ROE (NO CHANGE); In a normalized environment continue to
expect a 40%+/- overhead ratio
AWM - In a normalized environment continues to expect long-term AUM flows of 4% of book, revenue growth of 5%, pre-
tax margin and ROE of 25%+ (NO CHANGE)
Firm – We note this looks to imply a 17% ROTCE on ~12% CET1
Key takeaways
EPS beat. JPM reported 4Q20 EPS of $3.79. Our estimate was $2.51 and consensus was $2.62. EPS was $3.07,
excluding a $2.9bn ($0.72) loan loss reserve release (it noted positive vaccine and stimulus developments contributed to
its reserve release). The quarter also included $540mn of net gains on certain legacy equity investments, $243mn of
revenues from credit adjustments & other largely driven by funding and credit spread tightening on derivatives, and
$70mn of investment securities gains. These were partially offset by a $276mn of legal expense and $152mn of MSR
risk management losses ($425mn net benefit; $0.11).

Revenues up. Managed revenues increased 3% y-o-y and rose 1% linked quarter to $30.2bn. Tangible book increased
3.4% to $66.11 (2.1x). It posted a 1.42% ROA, 19% ROE and 24% ROTCE. Its CET1 ratio was unchanged at 13.1%, while
its SLR was declined 10bps to 6.9% (5.8% ex. temporary relief). Its LCR was 110%, down from 110%. Its average share
count was unchanged.
NII higher. Net interest income rose 2%. Average earning assets rose 3% with loans (+1%) and securities (+4%) higher
and trading assets lower (-1%). Period-end loans increased 2% with wholesale (+4%) and credit card (+3%) up and
consumer (-1%) lower. CCB loans were little changed with increases in auto (+7%) and card (+3%) offset by declines in
home lending (-2%) and consumer & business banking (-2%).
NIM slips. Its net interest margin declined 2bps to 1.80%. Its yield on average earning assets fell 8bps (-4bps ex CIB
markets) to 1.97% (loans +3bps, securities -19bps), while its cost of interest bearing liabilities declined 7bps to 0.23%
(IBD -2bps to 0.05%). Deposits rose 7% linked quarter with NIBD and IBD posting similar growth rates.
Fees income little changed. Fee income declined 1% with increases in credit card, asset management, investment
banking and lending & deposit fees more than offset by a seasonal decline in principal transaction and lower mortgage
fees.
Costs controlled. Expenses declined 2% y-o-y and decreased 5% from 3Q20 to $16.0bn. The y-o-y decline was driven
by lower volume- and revenue-related expense partially offset by higher investments in the business. Its managed
overhead ratio was 53%. Its effective tax rate was 19.4% (+40bps), while managed was 24.2%.
Asset quality benign. Its NAL ratio improved 7bps to 1.04%. Its NCO ratio declined 5bps to 0.44%. Wholesale NCOs
increased 12bps to 0.19%, consumer declined 3bps to 0.05%, and credit card fell 75bps to 2.17% (-84bps y-o-y). The
provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $1.9bn ($2.9bn of net reserve releases and $1.1bn of NCOs), compared to
an expense of $0.6bn in the prior quarter. It had a wholesale reserve release of $2.0bn, reflecting an improvement in the
macro-economic scenarios and the continued ability of clients to access liquidity and capital markets. The consumer
reserve release was $0.9nm, in Home Lending, primarily due to improvements in HPI expectations and portfolio run-off.
It had a $0.6bn release in 3Q20. Its reserve/loan ratio declined 31bps to 2.95%.
Line of Business Revenue Drivers
Consumer & Community Banking - Revenues rose 3% y-o-y and increased 12% sequentially to $4.3bn. Consumer &
Business Banking revenues increased fell 14% y-o-y, driven by the impact of deposit margin compression largely offset
by growth in deposit balances. Home Lending revenue increased 16% y-o-y, driven by higher net production revenue,
largely offset by lower net interest income on lower balances and spread compression as well as lower servicing
revenue. And, Card & Auto revenue decreased 7% y-o-y, driven by lower Card net interest income on lower balances.
Corporate & Investment Banking - Revenues rose 17% y-o-y and slipped 2% linked quarter to $11.4bn. Total trading
revenues rose 20% y-o-y (guided to +20%) but declined 10% linked quarter to $5.9bn. FICC rose 15% y-o-y, driven by
strong performance in Credit, Currencies & Emerging Markets and Commodities. Equities increased 32%, predominantly
driven by strong client activity in derivatives and Cash Equities. Securities Services was little changed. Investment
banking fees increased 34% y-o-y (guided to up 20%) and rose 18% linked quarter to $2.6bn as advisory jumped 95%,
debt underwing was unchanged, and equity underwriting declined 2%.
Commercial Banking - Revenues rose 7% y-o-y and increased 8% from 3Q20 to $2.5bn. Relative to the prior year,
growth was driven by higher deposit balances and fees, higher lending revenue due to increased portfolio spreads, and
higher investment banking revenue largely offset by lower deposit margin.
Asset & Wealth Management - Revenues rose 10% y-o-y and increased 9% q-o-q to $3.9bn. Relative to 4Q19, it
benefited from higher performance and management fees, as well as higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset
by deposit margin compression.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or
Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are

deemed to be in the same industry (“the industry coverage universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a
particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as
Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the
equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of
all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target:
Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's
expectation of where the stock will trade in the next 12 months. Upside/downside scenarios, where provided,
represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period.
Top Picks:
Barclays Equity Research's ""Top Picks"" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry
(as defined by the relevant ""industry coverage universe""), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that
industry. Barclays Equity Research publishes ""Top Picks"" reports every quarter and analysts may also publish intra-
quarter changes to their Top Picks, as necessary. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their
published research in addition to their Top Pick, there can only be one ""Top Pick"" for each industry. To view the current

PepsiCo (PEP, Overweight rated) is scheduled to report 4Q21 earnings results on Beverage, Household & Personal
Thursday, February 10, before the open. We have adjusted a few of our underlying Care Products
assumptions to better reflect the likely more challenging operating environment Andrea Teixeira, CFA AC
during 4Q(i.e., increased pricing actions but more than offset by worsened supply (1-212) 622-6735

sales moving to +8.9%/+8.4%, from +9.2%/+8.6% previously. Even after reducing BloombergJPMA TEIXEIRA <GO>

this outlook, we are still ahead of the current Consensus Metrix and implied

bottom-line perspective, our 4Q21 EPS of $1.53 remains unchanged and is ahead

of current Bloomberg consensus of $1.52(and, for what it’s worth the implied 4Q

been the norm from staples earnings so far, in particular HPC, the operating

Net-net we expect continued solid performance from PEP, and its resilient and
defensive business model is clearly in favor as evidenced by its outperformanceof
late (since 3Q results PEP +16.1% vs. XLP +11.1% and SPX +3.1%), and while
current valuation is making it tougher to see more meaningful upside in shares
near term, we think PEP remains a core staples holding given its resilience of
above-average underlying top-and bottom-line growth and better visibility, which
are the primary investment merits that investors look for in staples..

 Framing Top-Line Expectations for 2022. Following a very strong year from a top-
line organic growth perspective in 2021 (expectation to close the year at approximately
+8% on top of +4.3% organic growth in 2020 despite pandemic impact), the company
is expecting 2022 to be consistent with its long-term financial algorithm, which calls
for +MSD% (+4-6%) organic growth. While the company moved past the worst of the
pandemic impacts in 2021, the year was not without challenges, and with still-
recovering marketsand various supply chain issues through the year, we see continued
runway for recovery and underlying growth in 2022 across segments (excluding juice
divestiture impact in PBNA) given pricing actions and volume growth with improving
supply conditions, recovering away-from-home volumes, and resilient at-home
performance. At a high level, we think the underlying momentum driven by
investments in marketing and innovation position the company well to deliver in line
with its +MSD% organic growth targets, particularly given momentum in FLNA and
PBNA (which we discuss more in the note). All in, we are currently forecasting
organic revenue growth of +5.2% (volumesup +1.6% and price/mix up +3.6%), which
is very slightly ahead of Consensus Metrix consensus of +5.1%.
 What Will Margins Look Like in 2022? PEP’s ability to potentially drive margin
expansion in 2022 despite the significant inflationary pressures being seen throughout
the industry should set it apart from the majority of CPG peers and highlight the
resilience and attractiveness of its business model, which calls for core operating
margin expansion of 20-30 bps per annum. PEP has solid visibility into expected cost
pressures and has taken multiple rounds to price through higher inflation, including
some over the summer and “much more” in the fall, with the full impact being seen in
1Q22. The company should also continue to execute against $1 billion annual
productivity initiatives, which is mostly reliant on leveraging automation and
digitization and should be particularly helpful in an environment with higher labor
inflation. The divestiture of lower-margin juice business (we estimate the business
generated HSD% EBIT margins) will be a benefit to margins, which we estimate could
be worth about 20-30 bps to gross and EBIT margins. While the input cost
environment continues to evolve, given the pricing and productivity efforts across the
business, we think PEP can deliver about 20 bps gross margins expansion in 2022
(roughly flat pre-divestiture) and operating margin expansion of +65bps(+33 bps pre-
divestiture).
 Updated FX Outlook. With its 3Q21 earnings release, PEP reiterated its outlook for
FX to be a +1% translational tailwind to both revenue and EPS, and since the day prior
to that release (October 4, 2021) FX has turned less favorable by about 60 bps for 4Q
according to our currency model, and looking ahead to 2022, the impact of currency
has gotten incrementally unfavorable by about -50 bps. Net-net for 2022, we would
expect currency to be a headwind of about -1%. For 4Q21 and 2022 we are now
forecasting FX to be a 30 bps benefit and -100 bps headwind, respectively, vs.60 bps
benefit and flat previously.
 4Q21 Expectations. Our 4Q21 EPS of$1.53is unchanged (vs. Bloomberg consensus
of $1.52 and company-guided implied 4Q EPS of at least $1.47) even as we tweak a
number of our underlying assumptions to better reflect our view of the operating
environment in 4Q and the scanner data, as well as updated FX outlook. As such, our
4Q organic growth estimate moves to +8.4% from +8.6% previously, but is still ahead
of current Consensus Metrix of +7.6% and company-guided implies 4Qorganic growth
of +7.1%. We are expecting an acceleration of price/mix in the quarter as additional
pricing actions begin to flow through (our +5.3% price/mix is ahead of consensus


Andrea Teixeira, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622-6735 04 February 2022

+5.0% and implies a modest sequential acceleration in the two-year CAGR) while our
+3.0% volume growth is 20 bps ahead of consensus and implies roughly flat sequential
two-year CAGR. From a margin perspective, we expect gross margin compression
of -75 bps (to 52.7% vs. consensus 52.5%) and 5 bps of leverage on SG&A (to 40.7%
vs. consensus 40.6%) as incremental pricing actions and productivity partially offset
inflationary and supply chain pressures while increased A&M is offset by reduced
COVID-19 costs. Additional detailsinside.
2022 Outlook
While the same sort of questions surround PEP as others in CPG for 2022, namely
the magnitude of inflationary pressures, likely pricing actions to mitigate these cost
pressures, and resulting elasticities, we think PEP has already done a good job in
previewing the company’s thoughts aroundthese topics and importantly during 3Q21
results indicated that it expected organic top-line and EPS growth inline with its
long-term algorithm (+MSD% organic top-line and +HSD% EPS growth), although
completion of the juice divestiture could be about $0.10 dilutive to EPS (-1.5%) and
FX figures to be somewhat more of a headwind now.That said, we expect these
topics will continue to command a fair amount of airtime on the company’s 4Q
earnings Q&A, as will the sustainability of the strong top-line momentum seen in
2021. Beyond the top-line and margins, weexpect FCF conversion and capital
allocation to be keytopicsin 2022 as proceeds from the close of the juice brands
divestiture and improved balance sheet position should also allow the company to
resume share repurchases in 2022.
Organic Revenue Growth
PEP’s expected 2021 organic growth of approximately +8% on top of +MSD%
growth in 2020 (despite the pandemic impact) is impressive,and since 2019 (based
on our estimates) the company could post a three-year organic revenue growth
CAGR of +5.7%. While the company moved past the worst of the pandemic impacts
in 2021, the year was not without challenges,and with still-recovering marketsand
various supply chain issues through the year(in particular for Gatorade), we see
continued runway for recovery and growth in 2022across segments given pricing
actions and volume growth with improving supply conditions, recovering away-
from-home volumes, and resilient at-home performance. At a high level, we think the
underlying momentum driven by investments in marketing and innovation position
the company well to deliver in line with its +MSD% organic growth targets,
particularly given momentum in FLNA and PBNA. In FLNA the drivers of growth
for 2022 are likely to be 1) continued growth in variety and multi-packs; 2) further
away-from-home recovery; and 3) faster growth in “permissible”snacking (e.g.,
lightly salted, organic, Pop Corners).In PBNA, we see the segment benefitting from
1) strong pricing environment for CSDs (i.e., rational); 2) aforementioned
investments in marketing and innovation; 3) further recovery in away-from-home
(was indexing at around 90% of 2019 levels); and 4) improving supply conditions for
Gatorade. All in, we are currently forecasting organic revenue growth of +5.2%
(volumes up +1.6% and price/mix up +3.6%). On a divisional basis, our organic
revenue forecasts are as follows: +4.9% in FLNA, +3.5% in QFNA, +4.3% in
PBNA, +9.2% in Latin America, +4.1% in Europe, +6.7% in Asia, Middle East, and
South Asia,and +6.3% in Asia-Pacific, Australia,and New Zealand/China. Below,
we outline our 2022forecasts vs. consensus.

Outlook for Margins
PEP’s ability to potentially drive margin expansion in 2022 despite the significant
inflationary pressures being seen throughout the industry should set it apart from the
majority of CPG peers and highlight the resilience and attractiveness of its business
model that calls for core operating margin expansion of 20-30 bps per annum.PEP’s
cost base is well diversified (no single commodity accounts for >10%),and the
company noted in 3Q21 that its supply chain was well managed(except for
Gatorade,which continues to face stock outs due to disruptions from co-packer).
From an inflation perspective, PEP typically forward hedges six to ninemonths,and
as such the company is beginning to roll into higher costs, although PEP has solid
visibility into expected cost pressures and has taken multiple rounds to price through
higher inflation,including some over the summer and “much more” in the fall, with
the full impact being seen in 1Q22. The company should also continue to execute
against $1 billion annual productivity initiatives, which is mostly reliant on
leveraging automation and digitizationandshould be particularly helpful in an
environment with higher labor inflation.Also, the divestiture of the lower-margin
juice business (we estimate this business generated EBIT margins in the HSD%
range) should mechanically lift margins in 2022, which we estimate could be worth
20-30 bps to gross and EBIT margins. While the input cost environment continues to
evolve, given the pricing and productivity efforts across the businessand juice
divestiture, we think PEP can deliver about +20 bps gross marginsexpansion and
operating margin expansion of +65bps.
2022EPS
On the bottomline, we forecast 2022EPS of $6.63, which $0.10 below the current
Bloomberg consensus(likely includes a mix of estimates including/excluding the
juice brands divestiture), although excluding about $0.10 dilution from the juice
divestiture our 2022 EPS would have been $6.73, inline with consensus. Our 2022
EPS forecast implies +6.1% growth YOY, or +7.7% pre-divestiture(inline with
PEP’s long-termalgorithm of +HSD core constant currency EPS growth). An
unfavorableFX environmentwill likely also be a headwind, although excluding that
we think PEP could have reached HSD% EPS growth even inclusive or the juice
divestiture. Our 2022 EPS estimate also assumes 1 point of growth from share
repurchases.Below, we outline our forecasts vs. consensus.

4Q21 Earnings Preview
Date: Thursday, February 10
Estimated Release Time: 6:00 AM ET
Conference Call Details:
Pre-recorded Management Discussion: 6:30 AM ET (transcript of prepared remarks
will be released at this time as well)
Live Q&A Conference Call: 8:15 AM ET
PepsiCo (PEP, Overweightrated) is scheduled to report 4Q21 earnings results on
Thursday, February 10, before the open. We have adjusted a few of our underlying
assumptions to better reflect operating dynamics during the quarter, as well as for
recent FX movements, which results in a modestly lower top-line expectation (4Q21
total/organic sales growth +8.6%/+8.4% vs. +9.2%/+8.6% previously),although our
4Q21 EPS remains $1.53. Our $1.53EPS estimate for 4Q is $0.01ahead of the
current Bloomberg consensus. Overall, PEP’s 2021 guidance calls for full-year
organic growth of approximately +8% and “at least"" +12% core EPS growth,
implying core 2021 EPS of “at least”$6.20. PEP’s 2021 guidance implies 4Q
organic growth of approximately +7.1% and EPS of at least $1.47 (vs. current
Consensus Metrix organic growth +7.6% and Bloomberg consensus EPS of $1.52).
Through PEP’s 4Q (16-week period) endedDecember 25, we think the operating
environment likely remained largely supportive of strong underlying organic growth
trends seen in 3Q (+9.0%) and yeartodate (+8.4%), although during the quarter the
company dealt with the brunt of the Delta variant (early September in the US) and
the beginning of the Omicron surge. We don’t see these events as having a material
impact on underlying demand trends, which appeared to remain strong in the tracked
channel data, although impacts to the supply chain, including likelihood of employee
absenteeismat plants and on routes, could have had an impact on keeping shelves
fully stocked(i.e., could have had lost sales despite the strength seen in scanner
data). On the other hand, some limiting factors to 3Q growth, including a plant
outage in FLNA in 3Q and bottle shortage for Gatorade in PBNA, should have
resolved (in the case of FLNA) or lessened (inthe case of Gatorade).Moreover, to
the extent that a virus surge negatively impacts on-premise performance, for PEP we
would expect there to be an offset in off-premise demandincluding in QFNA, which
benefits from more at-home breakfast occasions.


Andrea Teixeira, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622-6735 04 February 2022

Comparisons are tougher sequentially (lapping +5.7% organic from 4Q20 vs. +4.2%
from 3Q2), although our current estimates, while a bit of a sequential deceleration
(modeling +8.1% organic in 4Q21 vs. +9.0% reported in 3Q21), implya flattwo-
year CAGR sequentially from +6.6% in 3Q21 with additional pricing actions taken
in the marketplace potentially mitigated by some supply chain disruptions during the
quarter. Specific to pricing, CFO Johnston noted that the company was taking
additional pricing (“much more” relative to pricing taken earlier in the year) in the
fall, which should begin to flow through in 4Q21,and we continue to expect a focus
on RGM initiatives given the cost inflation throughout the supply chain.
From a profitability perspective, we are expecting less gross margin pressure in 4Q
vs. 3Q given the aforementioned easier compares and pricing actions, although we
are still forecasting -75 bps compression (to 52.7%),and on a two-year basis we are
expecting slightly higher pressure relativeto 3Q21 (i.e., modeling gross margin -190
bps vs. 4Q19 relative to -180 bps compression in 3Q21 vs. 3Q19).Our gross margin
estimates are modestly higher than the current Bloomberg consensus (20 bps above
consensus of 52.5%), although we are also modelingfor slightly stronger topline
(both volumes and pricing). On SG&A, we are conversely slightly higher than
consensus with anSG&A ratio of 40.7% vs. current Bloomberg consensus of 40.6%.
The company should have a sizable increase in A&M spending in the PBNA
segment in 4Q21 given tougher compares vs. last year. On the otherhand, while it’s
likely that there were COVID-19 costs in 4Q21 given Delta and Omicron, we would
expect that costs incurred should be more moderated from prior-year levels of
$106M (e.g., 1Q20-3Q20 COVID-19 costs $668M vs. 1Q21-3Q21 $114Mand 3Q21
specifically COVID-19 costs $18M vs. $147M in 3Q20, or 0.6% to operating
margins and roughly ~$0.07-0.08 to EPS).
On PEP’s Q&A conference call, we expect investors to focus on the overall
cost/inflationary environment, progress on pricing actions and any associated
elasticities being seen in the marketplace, as well as general impacts from evolution
of the COVID-19 virus around the globe, in particular recent impacts from Omicron
on away-from-home demand and supply chain (e.g., absent sick employees
impacting DSD system).

Organic Revenue Growth in 4Q
As noted above, we broadly expect another solid quarter from a top-line perspective
ahead of the implied 4Q guidance,and at the company level our organic growth
estimate of +8.6% for 4Q is 100 bps ahead of the Consensus Metrix consensus of
+7.6% and implied 4Q company guidance of about +7.1%. Our estimate implies a
modest acceleration in the two-year CAGR to +7.1% from +6.6% in 3Q,while
consensus assumes a sequentially flat two-year CAGR. We do not believe we are
being overly aggressive in our higher estimates as we assume volumes largely flat
sequentially from a two-year CAGR perspective (+3.0%) and pricing to accelerate to
+4.1% two-year CAGR in 4Q from +3.7% in 3Q. Consensus Metrix is likewise
contemplating an acceleration in pricing but to a lesser extent than we are,and on
volumes we are broadly inline.
We expect investors to focus mostly on FLNA and PBNA organic growth trends, as
is typically the case, to gauge the resiliency of the snacks and beverages businessas
the company deals with potential supply chain impacts from COVID-19 and executes
on additional marketplace pricing actions.In other segments like QFNA, we expect
investors to focus on the sustainability of breakfast occasions and to look to any
potential benefits from more cautious return to office habits given Omicron surge,
and in International markets we expect investors to focus on the overall pace of
recovery given varying timing and levels of mobility restrictions in some
International markets. Putting it all together, our forecasted 4Q organic revenue
growth of +8.1% is driven by volumes +3.0% and price/mix +5.3%. On a divisional
basis, our organic revenue forecasts are as follows: +9.0% in FLNA, -1.0% in
QFNA, +7.0% in PBNA, +14.9% in Latin America, +6.0% in Europe, +10.8% in
Asia, Middle East, and South Asia, and +11.4% in Asia Pacific, Australia, New
Zealand/China.

US Trends Accelerated across Beverages and Food in4Q21Driven by Price/Mix
Looking at the NielsenIQ scanner data over PEP’s 4Q21 ending December 25 (16-
week period),trends accelerated across PEP’s US segments including beverages,
FLNA categories (i.e., salty snacks), and QFNA categories (i.e., breakfast foods)
both on a one-and two-year basis. Takeaway growth in the period corresponding to
PEP’s 4Q was driven predominantly by price/mix as volumegrowth was largely
lackluster.Specifically, for the 16-week period ending December25, total PEP
dollar takeaway grew +10.9%, which accelerated from the +5.1% growth in the
12-week period ending September 4(corresponds to PEP’s 3Q)as year-ago
comparisons eased by about 110 bps (i.e., lapping +8.3% growth in the 16-week

period ending 12/26/20 vs. +9.4% growth in the 12-week period ending 9/5/20). As
such, two-year stack growth likewise accelerated to +19.2%in the 16-week
period ending 12/25/21 vs. +14.5% in the 12-week period ending 9/4/21).Within
the segments, for the 16-week period ending 12/25/21 PBNA grew +11.4% (volumes
+1.2%, price/mix +10.2%), FLNA grew +10.5% (volumes +0.2%, price/mix
+10.3%), and QFNA grew +4.4% (volumes +7.3%, price/mix -2.9%), all of which
accelerated sequentially from the 12-week period ending 9/4/21 where PBNA grew
+4.5% (volumes -0.3%, price/mix +4.8%), FLNA grew +5.7% (volumes +2.2%,
price/mix +3.5%), and QFNA declined -2.2% (volumes -0.1%, price/mix -2.1%).On
a two-year stack basis in the 16weeks ending 12/25/21 relative to the 12weeks
ending 9/4/21, Beverages growth of +20.1% accelerated +300 bps sequentially,
FLNA growth of +19.1% accelerated +480 bps sequentially, and QFNA growth of
+10.4% accelerated +620 bps sequentially.

Updated FX Outlook
With its 3Q21 earnings release, PEP reiterated its outlook for FX to be a +1%
translational tailwind to both revenue and EPS, and since the day prior to that release
(October 4, 2021) FX has turned less favorable by about 60 bps for 4Q according to
our currency model,and looking ahead to 2022, the impact of currency has gotten
incrementally unfavorable by about -50 bps. Net-net for 2022, we would expect
currency to be a headwind of about -1%. For 4Q21 and 2022 we are now forecasting
FX to be a 30 bps benefit and -100 bps headwind, respectively, vs. 60 bps benefit and
flat previously.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
PepsiCo, Inc.(Overweight; Price Target: $185.00)
Investment Thesis
We rate PepsiCo Overweight. We believe PepsiCo has a product mix poised to
deliver solid organic top-line growth and a track record of consistently beating Street
expectations over the past few years, which compares favorably withlarge-cap
Consumer Staples peers. As with our other large-cap multinationals, PEP’s absolute
earnings performance has been significantly hit by the stronger dollar over the past
years (albeit by less than most of its multinational peers). With a sales mix that
skews toward snacks, which benefit from at-home consumption,we see a relatively
favorable risk/reward over the next 12 monthsand believe PEP is one of the few
large-cap names where we see limited downside risk from amultiple perspective.
Valuation
PEP is currently trading at ~26.4x our2022 EPS estimate, which is a ~11% premium
to PEP’s one-year average, which we believe is fair given the resilient top-/bottom-
line growth and the positive outlook for reopening (~15% of sales are on-premises).
Our Dec 2022 price targetof $185is derived from a 50%/50% blend of P/E and
EV/EBITDA, using the averagesof non-alcohol peers of 26.2x and 17.1x,
respectively. With a greater emphasis on growth post recent acquisitions, we think
Pepsi is positioned to grow earnings in the HSDs post COVID-19 and therefore
remain an earnings compounder. We also think Pepsi compares favorably to other
large-cap multinational peers in our coverage because of its exposure to snacks and
under-indexed presence in EM where consumption during COVID-19 was negatively
impacted and should rebound ahead.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
We think the primary risks to our Overweight rating and price target on PepsiCo
include (1)greaterthananticipated disruptions from COVID-19, in particular in the
on-premise channels; (2) increased competition;(3) concerns around health and
wellness and the impact this could have on the company’s top-and bottom-line
results;(4) commodities cost increases or potential for additional taxes on sugary
beverages in more jurisdictions,both in the United States and internationally;and (5)
FX volatility.

Details on 4Q22 Results
WMT reported 4Q22 adjusted EPS of $1.53 vs. consensus at $1.50 and our estimate of $1.49.
Total revenue came in at $152.9B, an increase of 0.5% y/y (or $153.0B when excluding the
effects of currency). Walmart U.S. comp transactions of +3.1% drove comp sales of +5.6%,
which was higher than our estimate of 5.0% and Consensus of 5.4%. U.S. e-commerce sales
grew 1% y/y and 70% on a 2 – year stack basis. Sam’s Club comps increased 10.4% ex fuel
and FX compared to our estimate of 8.0% and consensus at 9.2%. Membership income
increased 9.1% y/y with the member count reaching an all – time high. Lastly, ecommerce
sales grew 21% y/y at Sam’s Club.
Consolidated gross margin increased ~10bps, reflecting price management and mix and
growth in the advertising business, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. Consolidated
SG&A expenses deleveraged 1bps due to higher wages, partially offset by strong sales and
lower y/y COVID costs. Lastly, the EBIT margin was 4.0% vs. Barc/Cons estimates of
4.1%/4.0%.
WMT U.S. gross margin increased by ~54bps y/y due to price management and mix including
a benefit from WMT Connect partially offset by higher supply chain costs. U.S. operating
income grew 0.3% y/y reflecting an EBIT margin of 4.92% compared to our estimate of
5.29% and consensus at 5.21%. Sam’s Club operating income increased by 41.1% y/y and
WMT International operating income decreased 0.6% y/y (excluding divestures of $31M) –
underscoring the strength of WMT’s broad based performance. Looking ahead, WMT is well
positioned from an inventory perspective given that WMT U.S. inventory was up 28.3% y/y
at the end of 4Q.
Takeaways from Follow-Up Call with Management
 WMT isn’t seeing any metrics that would indicate that inflation has become a problem for
consumers yet, but is prepared if the economy worsens.
 One indicator is private label penetration – and so far, private label penetration has not
yet increased as would typically happen when consumers become more budget
conscious and January had positive comp even on tough stimulus fuelled comps from last
year.
 While supply chain logjams have improved slightly recently, WMT is still building in longer
lead times as the global supply chain is still far from historical pre-COVID efficiency.
 As point of clarification, 1Q EPS growth guidance excluded divestitures, and as a
reminder, WMT’s F4Q23 is expected to benefit vs. F4Q22 due to the shift of Big Billions
Day Internationally. However, the larger driver of income growth in F4Q23 is expected to
be the over $700M in supply chain ($400M) and Covid leave costs ($300M) from F4Q22,
which are anticipated to abate.
 The vast majority of the incremental capex in FY23 is expected to be for supply chain and
technology.
 WMT won’t lap their last major wage increase until midway through F3Q23, resulting in
a y/y SG&A deleverage in general - this could prove to be a theme for several other
retailers in our coverage.
 Within FY23 guidance, WMT has incorporated a level of wage inflation – but currently
expects it to be more surgical in nature compared to the broad wage increases from FY22.
 WMT is currently able to adequately meet their staffing needs - and even exceeded their
hiring goals during 4Q.

Barclays | Walmart Inc.
 As expected - WMT’s advertising business’ flowthrough is significantly higher than the
average gross margin for WMT – but is not a direct/100% flow through – so we would
just caution this new revenue stream is not a direct offset/benefit to gross margins
because there are some costs associated with the revenue stream.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage
universe"").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative
(see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully
read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"":

Valuation Methodology: Our $170 price target is based on a ~12x EV/EBITDA multiple and FY24 EBITDA of ~$40.1 billion.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: We believe the long-term risks for Walmart
include: (1) the challenges associated with managing increasingly vast and complex operations, (2) the growing contribution of the lower-margin
food business to the overall merchandise mix, (3) the ability to acquire and successfully integrate assets abroad, (4) the proficiency with which
the company adapts its store formats to the various economic and cultural environments in international markets, and (5) ability to profitably
grow its e-commerce business. Our earnings forecast and investment thesis for Walmart are subject to such factors as cost of goods, consumer
spending and debt levels, currency fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, store expansion plans, and variability in comparable store sales.

growth opportunities via incremental distribution & package mix (e.g. immediate

FLNA’s growth could accelerate by as much as 100bps as capacity constraints abate.

Barclays | PepsiCo Inc.
For the quarter itself, we look for organic sales to grow +6.2% with volumes up +3.4% and a
~280 bps tailwind from price/mix. In North America, we expect growth to be led by PBNA
(+10% OSG) driven by HSD volume growth as the business laps an easy Covid comp and
stronger mix as reopenings progress (particularly in the US). We anticipate FLNA to grow
+6%, with the majority attributable to favorable price/mix dynamics. In contrast, we model
a -14% organic sales decline in Quaker as it laps a robust +23% from 2Q20 supported by
pantry loading. In international markets, we anticipate AMESA will lead the footprint in
growth (+10%) that is entirely a reflection of volumetric recovery during the period vs. year-
ago levels. Trailing AMESA are Europe (+7%) and Latin America (+5%). We expect
aggregate Asia Pacific to decline -5%, but we note the region was an outlier among the
international business last spring having grown +15% in 2Q20. With respect to margins, we
expect gross margins to contract nearly 100 bps, with a continued drag from the Pioneer
transaction. The GM compression is offset by lower forecasted SG&A as percent of revenue,
translating to flat operating margin YoY at 15.8%. All-in, we anticipate 2Q EPS of $1.49.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage
universe"").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"":

Russia) accelerate, 2) New innovation helps PEP exceed revenue expectations. Downside: 1) Increases in commodity and fuel prices offer less
margin upside, 2) Continued pressure on North America Beverages business, 3) Slowing trends in core Frito business.

Headwinds and Apple Share Gains

Even though available at quite at a lag with the latest release being for the month
of October, the public data from China Academy of Information and Samik Chatterjee, CFA AC
Communications Technology (CAICT) relative to the smartphone industry in (1-212) 622 0798
China in the month of October offers further evidence of two widely 
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
acknowledged, and conflicting, drivers for iPhone revenues - 1) Shipments
Joseph Cardoso
declining for Apple and the industry y/y, with declines of about -14% y/y for Apple
(1-212) 622-9036
if we aggregate September and October to moderate the effect of the shipment

delays last year; 2) Share gains for iPhones continuing in the market with share J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
hitting a high point of 23% of the market with help from the launch of iPhone 14. Angela Jin
Lastly, it is important to keep in mind that the absolute unit sales in the month of (1-212) 622-0514
October do not contain any material supply constraints from the lower utilization 
currently impacting the Zhengzhou plant in China, and we would expect supply on J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
a stand-alone basis to be a driver of worsening y/y trends in November and Manmohanpreet Singh
December. (91-22) 6157-5197

Coming back to the October data, International (Apple) shipments tracked at 7.6 J.P. Morgan India Private Limited
mn units for the month of October, decreasing -30% y/y. However, if we compare
shipments since product launch, i.e. shipments for Sep + Oct, (as the Oct-21
shipments were exceptionally higher due to delayed product availability due to
supply chain troubles very early into the launch), they were lower by -14% y/y. For
the same time frame, total China market shipments were lower by -18% y/y,
pointing towards better than market trends for Apple and a market share since
iPhone 14 launch of 23%, vs. 22% at a similar time during iPhone 13 cycle. For the
month of October, overall shipments growth for the industry tracked -27% lower
on y/y basis. 5G shipments for the month of October were strong at 19.5 mn units,
representing 80% of the total shipments.
• International shipments (Apple) till October have been lower y/y for
iPhone 14 cycle. Based on the latest CAICT report, International brand mobile
phone shipments (comprising primarily of Apple) for the latest product cycle
(Sep+Oct shipments) tracked -14% y/y till October. However, from a market
share perspective, International shipments were modestly better than prior
cycle, with 23% share during iPhone 14 cycle till October, vs. 22% in the prior
product cycle and historical average of 17% at this point in the cycle. P lease
note that we view CAICT data as only a directional view into volume trends,
while absolute sales volumes reported by CAICT might differ from actual
volumes.
• 5G mix accounted for ~80% of total shipments in October. CAICT’s
monthly report disclosed 5G mobile phone shipments in China increased
+29% m/m to ~20 mn units in October, with 5G smartphones tracking to ~80%
of total shipments vs. ~79% in the prior year. For Jan-Oct 2022, 5G shipments,
although -18% y/y lower than 2021, were 78% of the total shipments vs. 74%
at similar time in 2021. For the full year 2021, 5G smartphone shipments

Q4 Highlights: EPS of $1.39 came in below consensus of $1.51 and our estimate of $1.50, but
included a one-time UK tax payment of $0.07. WMT U.S. comp growth of 8.6% was paced by a 21.9%
increase in ticket and a 10.9% decline in transactions. Grocery was up HSD (vs. up MSD last quarter) as
in-stocks improved and store hours expanded. U.S. gross margin improved by 20bps due to strategic
sourcing, fewer markdowns, and progress in e-commerce, while opex deleveraged by 22bps despite
lapping a $450 million restructuring charge due to higher COVID costs. WMT International grew
sales by 6.3% on a constant currency basis, with positive comp performance in 7/9 markets. The UK
divestiture closed earlier this week and is expected to result in EPS dilution of $0.25 in year one. Sam's
Club saw comp growth excl. fuel of 10.8% including a 410bps headwind from tobacco. For 2021,
management guided to WMT U.S. comps up LSD (excl. fuel), Sam's Club comps up LSD (excl. fuel and
tobacco), and a slight decline in consolidated EPS.
Analyst Day Highlights: (1) WMT is raising the average associate wage to above $15/hour. On
3/13, the company will raise pay for 425,000 store associates (roughly half of total), with starting
rates moving to $13-19 based on location. WMT's overall minimum wage will remain at $11. Cost
discipline should resume in 2022, with expense leverage expected to continue at 20bps or more
annually. (2) Capex is expected to jump to $14 billion in 2021 (from $10 billion in 2020) and 2.5-3%
of sales going forward. Management plans to invest aggressively in areas such as supply chain/
fulllment, automation, and technology, positioning the company for 4%+ sales growth and EBIT
margin expansion in the coming years. (3) International growth should exceed U.S. levels in 2021
(excluding recent divestitures, i.e. Argentina in November 2020, UK in February 2021, and Japan
in 1Q21), led by India, Mexico, and China. (4) Sam's Club seems to be gaining momentum, with
merchandise improvements in fresh and private label. (5) E-commerce growth remains strong, with
global sales approaching $100 billion over the next few years. Guidance for 2021 was not provided. (6)
The company is scaling new capabilities, ranging from pickup/delivery and healthcare/nancial services
to digital media and third-party fulllment, in an attempt to transform itself into a next-generation
retailer. (7) WMT increased its annual dividend to $2.20 and authorized a new $20 billion share repo
program, which will be used over the next three years.

A Little Bit Goes a Long Way
INVESTMENT OPINION: WMT’s breakout from a trading range to a new
high suggests that a move into the $85-$100 range is likely if its holiday
WMT-NYSE $82.25 season is successful.
52-Week Range $83-$72
3Q/14 EPS of $1.15 vs. $1.14 was in line with guidance, but a 0.5%
Market Cap. $252bn
same-store sales increase for US Walmart, the first in seven
Shares Outstdg. 3.2bn
Debt/Total Cap. 41.3%* quarters, sent WMT surging to an all-time high.
Divd. Yield $1.92/2.3%
Notable was US Walmart’s ability to win on key selling occasions—back-

to-school and Halloween, and a sales increase for apparel, when most
apparel retailers struggled. The big drag was from electronics and
entertainment, which provides an outsized portion of sales during the
holiday season.

stores match Amazon’s prices, Walmart is making a big push for sales in
2014E 4 .92 16.7x 4Q/14. Success selling food for Thanksgiving and Christmas Days will
2013 5.11
also be required.
2012 5.02
It has been a dozen years since the CEOs of Corporate and US Walmart
were imbued with store experience. Now we hear knowledgeable talk
about details—such as the freshness of green vegetables and shopping
experiences that mold shoppers’ perceptions of stores. If as everyone
says retail is detail, then Walmart is likely to be guided better to serve
shoppers than in many years.
To achieve a 4Q/14 operating profit better than the 1.2% decline by US
Walmart in 3Q/14, the cost of additional labor hours will need to be
overcome. International operations and Sam’s had gains in 3Q/14.
We stand behind our assumptions that:
 Walmart’s growth rate will accelerate in 2015,
Bernard Sosnick
 Walmart will become formidable in e-commerce, and
631-964 -8716  Walmart will be a winner in the consolidation of retailing.

Net income growth has been stymied in recent years but EPS has risen
due a reduction in the share count. If net income growth resumes, as we
believe it will, EPS would justify a price of $85-$100 per share.

Risks to Earnings and Appreciation Expectations
This is a dangerous time for Walmart because it no longer in sole possession of advantages that made it great.
It cannot afford slip-ups as retailing in the US and globally change rapidly due to changes in shopping
preferences influenced by the growth of e-commerce.
Walmart, with operations across the globe, is exposed to a myriad of economic, political, legal and operational
risks. A copy of the risk recitation can be obtained at www.walmartstores.com/investors.
Economic uncertainties and currency risks may cause a shortfall in operating results relative to expectations.
Bigger efforts to generate sales, such as Black Friday events, are required to keep US Walmart’s same-store
sales from falling.
The company has significant exposure to legal matters.
At a P/E of 14X our EPS estimate for 2015, WMT already reflects a degree of optimism about future prospects
and is vulnerable to a pullback if sales or profits should disappoint in upcoming quarters.

 Revenue between $41 billion and $43 billion, down about 15% yoy from US$49.6 bn
 Gross margin between 37.5% and 38%, about 1-2% difference yoy from 39.7%

 Other income/(expense) of US$300 mn, down from US$400 mn yoy
 Tax rate of 25.5%, compared to 26.3% last year
Initiating coverage with ""Buy"" rating
AAPL has had impressive 840% growth rate over the past 10 years, with iPhone as its main
growth driver. Despite recent weakness, AAPL is still generating enormous profits and cash.
AAPL generated more than US$50 bn in revenue and more than US$10 bn in net income
during a difficult quarter. Additionally, its expansion in Services segment could provide
support to its future growth. Services has been increasing at an incredible rate, averaging
about 20% growth over 5 years, and as AAPL expands its services, users would become
more entrenched into its ecosystem.
We are Positive on the Company’s long term prospects, supported by its robust
established user base and strong balance sheet. Nonetheless, much would still hinges on
the Company’s ability to innovate and contribution from its new products.
We have a DCF valuation of US$119.37 for AAPL.
Investment Thesis
1. Strong Brand Equity with loyal consumer base
iPhone sales are the main revenue source for AAPL and accounts for 65% of AAPL’s total
revenue. As such, AAPL is known primarily as a hardware company, selling iPhones. The
Company has taken steps to diversify its revenue streams. While these steps do show
promise, but at this point in time, the impact on total revenue is negligible compared to
the revenue from the iPhone.

However, with the poor showing in its latest quarter results, coupled with near term macro
headwinds and market saturation, it is likely that iPhone sales for the remaining of 2016
could be flattish, and this year could be the first year that AAPL will report a decline in unit
sales.
That said, AAPL mentioned several mitigating factors that could underpin iPhone Sales:
 Upgrades. The first half of the upgrade cycle for iPhone 6s has seen a slightly higher
rate than the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago. It cited a Kantar survey showing a 95%
iPhone loyalty rate. Furthermore, according to Kantar, the iPhone 6 and 6 plus
accounted only for 24% of all iPhones being used in US and China (US and China
iPhone users account for 65% of its total user base). Coupled with iPhones 6s sales,
that represents a sizable portion of current iPhone users that have yet to upgrade to
the 6 or 6s, which AAPL could tap on when the next iteration is introduced. This was
also mentioned previously by Tim Cook, with 60% of current iPhone users have yet to
upgrade.
 Switchers. AAPL mentioned that there were more switchers from Android or other
platforms to iOS in the 1HFY16 compared to any other six-month period ever.
 First timer. AAPL mentioned that India could be the next growth driver and market for
iPhones, citing iPhone sales in India were up 56% yoy. While global smartphone
market seems to have reached saturation point in developed nations, India’s LTE
network is still rolling out, representing a large untapped market. First timers are
crucial to the Company’s long term growth. Each new user is a potential loyal AAPL
user. Once the user becomes entrenched into its “Eco-system”, the user could start
engaging in its Services and purchasing other AAPL products.
iPhone SE, released on 31st March was not included in 2QFY16’s results. AAPL cites that
demand for iPhone SE has exceeded its expected supply, leading also to the depressed
3QFY16 profit guidance. Should sales for the iPhone SE take off, it would be indicative of
pent up demand for cheaper iPhones and an opportunity for AAPL to create further
headway into developing markets.
Should AAPL follow its previous release schedules and release the iPhone 7 around
September (end FY16), it could also entice the large pool of older iPhone users to upgrade
as the iPhone 5 and 5s would be 2 product cycles old by then. However, the new iPhone 7
could only start contributing to its bottom line in FY17.
Given these factors, we believe that while iPhones will face headwinds in the increasingly
saturated developed nations’ smartphone market, the fears of “peak iPhone” are

APPLE INC. INITIATION
overblown and believe that there is potential for iPhone sales to grow in the future, albeit
at a slower rate.
(b) iPad Revenue
AAPL’s tablet offering; the iPad, used to account for about 18% of AAPL’s total revenue.
However, the rapid growth of iPhones and falling iPad sales has led to iPad now making up
only 10% of AAPL’s total revenue.
Tablets have longer replacement cycles compared to smartphones as consumers are less
compelled to upgrade their tablets compared to smartphones. In 2QFY16, AAPL reported
iPad sales were down 19% yoy with unit sales of 10.25 mn. iPad sales were slightly better Source: Apple
than consensus estimates which were on average about 9.95 mn. Of note however, the
new 9.7 inch iPad Pro was only released at the end of Q2 2016 and sales figures would not
have captured the full extent of demand. AAPL expects the next quarter to be the best iPad
quarter in two years based on their estimates. For now, we expect the iPad to continue
accounting for a smaller component of AAPL’s revenue over time.
Figure 05:
Source: Company
(c) Mac Revenue
Macs are AAPL’s laptops offering, they account for 11% of AAPL’s revenue. Mac unit sales
have been on the uptrend over the past 3 years as the Macbook has gained popularity and
more mainstream acceptance. However, Macbook sales fell 9% yoy in 2QFY16, which was
worse than consensus estimates. However, a silver lining is that AAPL is gaining traction in
China, where 80% of the Chinese Mac buyers were purchasing for the first time.
Management has given guidance that it expects Mac sales to increase in 3QFY16 on the Source: Apple
back of an updated Macbook, which was thinner and lighter with better specs. As one of
AAPL core offerings, we expect Mac sales to maintain its share of revenue as it gains
traction as a viable alternative to PCs. We believe that Mac sales will increase as compared
to the iPad, despite both having similarly long replacement cycles compared to iPhone due
to Mac having greater functionality.

Figure 06:
Source: Company
(d) Other Products
Apple Watch led to a 30% yoy growth in Other Product revenue, since it is a relatively new
product offering, the Watch has generated new avenues of revenue for AAPL. Whether the
take up rate can continue or the Watch becoming like the iPad in terms of replacement
rate remains to be seen.
2. Transition to Services
Revenue from Services rose 20% yoy to US$6 bn in 2QFY16. “Apple as a service” is a
concept that AAPL has taken large steps towards and is increasingly becoming the bright
spot in the current environment of stalling hardware sales. Services create the “Eco-
system” which allows AAPL to further entrench its user base, creating more reasons for its
“stickability”. AAPL has been showing that it is increasingly able to monetize that active
user base to generate more revenue from its services. In the 1QFY16, AAPL revealed that it
had 1 bn active installed base, devices that were actively engaged in Services within that
quarter, leading to Installed Base Related Purchases of US$8.9 bn. This figure grew by 27%
yoy to US$9.9 bn in the March quarter.
 App Store. Revenue grew by 35% yoy, generating 90% more global revenue than
Google Play.
 Apple Music. Music grew from 10 mn to 13 mn paying subscribers since introducing a
download and streaming model, leading AAPL to be optimistic that Apple Music
revenue will start growing again moving forward.
 Apple Pay. Being very new, Apple Pay is not expected to make significant contribution
to AAPL’s FY16 revenue. However, adoption rate is increasing exponentially, with
transactions volume growing by 500% yoy. AAPL has launched over 2.5 mn locations
that accept Apple Pay, with plans to expand further. While usage rates remain low, as
the idea of NFC (Near Field Communication) payment is still new and not widely
adopted yet, there is still much room for growth and eventually monetization.
However, with credit card companies like Visa, as well as other phone companies like
Samsung, are also heading into the space, the idea of NFC payments might not take
that long to be legitimized. As such, we view this as an avenue with great potential in
the future.
Page | 6 | PHILLIP SECURITIES RESEARCH (SINGAPORE)

APPLE INC. INITIATION
Overall, we see great potential in “Apple as a service”. It remains the one category of
revenue that AAPL has been able to achieve consecutive double-digit growth, on average
about 20%, over the past 5 years. Services provide recurring revenue stream for AAPL that
could grow independent of the unit sales, making it especially helpful in the current
environment of slowing hardware sales. We expect Services revenue to continue to grow
and become a greater part of AAPL’s revenue as upgrade cycles for iPhones stretch to 2-3
years.
Of note though, is China’s recent ban of AAPL iBooks and iTunes Movies, which could be a
potentially worrying trend. Considering that if Services are to be the future of AAPL and
China’s important role in this strategy, then it would be a huge detriment to AAPL’s future
growth if the ban expands to the rest of AAPL’s services. For now however, with just the
iBooks and iTunes Movies ban, while worrying, it is not a large dent in AAPL’s services
growth and the thesis of Service growth should still hold.

3. Rising consumer affluence in developing nations
AAPL main revenue source by region comes from Americas, which makes up 40% of the
total revenue. While Americas’ contribution to AAPL’s revenue has been increasing on an
absolute value, it has not been growing at a very fast pace. Americas’ revenue grew 4% in
2014 when total revenue grew 7%, and grew at 17% yoy in 2015 when total revenue grew
at 28%. It is likely that Americas’ revenue will continue to grow at a slower pace as
compared to the total revenue.
On the other hand, Greater China, which currently makes up 25% of its total revenue, has
been rising at an incredibly fast pace. In 2014, Greater China only made up 17.4%, this
represents an 84% yoy increase. In the 2QFY16, China had a qoq change of -32% from
1QFY16, and a yoy change of -26%. China was the main reason for AAPL’s explosive growth
in the previous year, growing by 84% yoy in FY15. In comparison, 2QFY16’s results appears
dismal, coming in at US$12.5 bn vs previous year’s US$16.8 bn. When seen against the
backdrop of such a breakout year previously, it is not surprising that investors have reacted
negatively to AAPL’s performance this quarter in China. However, we feel that this is less of
a slowdown and more of a normalization of AAPL’s sales in China. AAPL’s YTD revenue from
China stands at roughly US$30.8 bn, already almost as much as FY14, where revenue from
China was US$31.8 bn. As LTE network continues to expand in China and adoption
increases, we expect China’s demand for iPhones to continue to grow. However, whether
China adopts the same replacement rate that Americas has had over the past years
remains to be seen. Regardless, China should continue to be a growing source of revenue
for AAPL.
As mentioned earlier, India is also a developing market which could provide avenues of
future growth for AAPL, sales having grown 56% yoy. As LTE networks continue to rollout,
smartphones become more useable as compared to 2.5G or 3G networks, leading to
increase demand. APAC ex Japan accounted only for US$15 bn, being home to more
developing nations, but as those nations continue to develop, AAPL should be able to take
advantage of improvements in infrastructure to expand there.

4. Strong Balance Sheet
AAPL has amassed a large amount of cash, with US$232.9 bn in cash and marketable
securities as of 31 Mar 2016, up almost US$20 bn yoy. However, 90% of this cash hoard is
outside the USA. This is significant due to USA tax laws, which would cause AAPL to have to
pay upwards of about US$60 bn if it was to remit back to the USA. AAPL has thus taken
advantage of the current low interest rate environment to take on more debt. AAPL issued
another US$15.5 bn in USD notes in the latest quarter, bringing its debt level to about
US$72 bn. This puts its current net cash position at about US$160 bn, which is equivalent
to about US$30 per share. Most of the borrowings has been put to fund the Capital return
program, mainly dividends and share buybacks.

5. Attractive Capital Return Program
Dividends and buyback increased. AAPL announced a further increase to its capital return
program on 26th April 2016, increasing it to US$250 bn from US$200 bn in April 2015. The
dividend was increased to US$0.57 per share for shareholders on close of business 9th May-
16, up c.10% from US$0.52. Since AAPL started paying a dividend in 2012, it has increased
the dividend each year consecutively, from US$0.38 per share to US$0.52, with a CAGR of
about 8%p.a. This represents a payout ratio of about 24%, which is relatively low,
indicating that there is still substantial room for future dividend growth. Share repurchase
authorization was also increased from US$140 bn to US$175 bn.
Valuation
Valuation Methodology: Discounted Free Cash Flow Model
DCF model was used to derive a valuation of AAPL’s intrinsic value.
We have made the following assumptions for the model:
 Headwinds in iPhone sales leading to decline and slow growth over the next two
years, after which iPhone sales should start growing at a slower rate
 iPad sales may pick up in the next FY but repeat the cycle of slow replacement,
leading to flat revenue
 Increase in Mac take up as Macbooks gain traction and more mainstream
acceptance as PC and laptop replacements
 Service Revenue will increase as AAPL expands their ecosystem and continues to
increase the monetization of their user base
We initiate coverage for AAPL with a “Buy” rating with a target price of US$119.37, derived
from our DCF estimates.

Risks to valuation
Poor response to iPhone 7. While AAPL’s customer base is very loyal, if iPhone 7 has a
lacklustre showing and fails to excite that base, it could lead to even lower take up and a
longer replacement cycle. Weaker consumer sentiment amidst slowdown in the global
economy could also negatively impact the take up of iPhones.
Slowdown in Services. Services have been growing at an incredible rate and been the one
bright spot in the 2QFY16. AAPL transitioning into more of a Services company rather than
a Hardware company also forms the basis for our estimates of future growth. If Services
revenue slows down or if consumers fail to become entrenched into AAPL’s ecosystem, it
would adversely affect AAPL and our valuations.

It is difficult to find a one to one comparison to AAPL in the US market, as while its peers
do have some overlap with AAPL, there is also large differences between them. As such, we
have chosen to show Google and Microsoft as peer comparisons. Google is relevant for the
Android comparison and Microsoft is relevant for the Windows phone, PC and its recent
move into a Service company as well.
AAPL remains the largest of the three companies by market cap. Based on PER, it is also the
more undervalued stock amongst the three, trading at about 10x PER while the other two
trade at more than 30x PER.
AAPL, at US$92.79, is also trading near its 52 week low of US$91.85. Based on the Historical
PER chart below, it is also trading at near 8 year low valuations. At US$92.79, AAPL is
trading at 10.32x PER as compared to its 5-year historical average of 13.7x PER.
Figure 12: Historical PER Chart

Conclusion
AAPL gave poor guidance for 3QFY16, citing continued macro headwinds sending AAPL
shares tumbling down. We expect AAPL’s share price to remain depressed in the short
term, while the market reacts bearishly to AAPL prospects and fears on iPhone’s saturation.
However, AAPL’s balance sheet remains strong with net cash at almost US$160 bn, which
works out to almost US$30 net cash per share. At current prices, that indicates a net price
US$60 per share, indicating a c.7x FY16e PER.
Additionally, its brand equity and loyal consumer base allows AAPL to continue to generate
large profits and cash flow even in difficult seasons. Its growing Services revenue is
promising as it shows AAPL is making headway in their transition to a Services company.
Therefore, we believe that the current knee jerk reaction in the market to AAPL is
overblown, leading to AAPL being undervalued. As such, we initiate a “Buy” rating on AAPL
with a Target Price of US$119.37, indicating about a 28% upside to the share (excluding
dividends).

Research Analyst
income was better than expected, though on the earnings call mgmt also cautioned
+1-212-250-5881
net II may decline in FY23 vs. the (higher) 4Q22 run rate.
Guidance
n Mgmt noted that the current US economy, consumer and business remains
healthy but there are fairly significant headwinds in the near future.
n Net interest income. Mgmt expects 4Q22 net interest income of $19b and
FY22 of $66b. Excluding markets (which is how JPM has guided so far this
year), net II is expected to be $19b in 4Q and $61.5b in FY22. This compares
to previous guidance of $58b++ and beat our expectations of $60b. Note
that mgmt assumes essentially no markets related net II in 4Q.
n The $19b NII expected in 4Q implies a $76b exit rate vs. $68b-plus
previously (ex markets).
n Expenses. The $77b guide for FY22 expenses remained unchanged.
n Card NCO. FY22 Card NCO rate of approximately 1.5% vs. previous
guidance of <2%.
n Mgmt noted that it will reach its target CET1 of 13% by 1Q23 and expects
to resume buybacks (which are currently suspended) in early 2023.
Lumpy items in the quarter
Results included the following drags: $959m of securities losses, $808m in LLR
build, we estimate about $300m of equity investment losses, $47m of legal and
$31m of CVA losses. There were modest gains of $54m related to MSR hedges. 19%
tax rate was a touch below expected.
Key trends
n Net interest income was strong, up more than $2b q/q driven by solid loan
growth (of 2% on average vs. 2Q). Period-end loans rose 1%, securities
dropped 7% and deposits were down 3% (with a 4% drop in US non interest
bearing).
n Net interest income ex markets was $16.9b vs. $13.7b in 2Q.

n Fee income declined 8% yoy.
n Trading increased 8% yoy vs. guidance of +5%. FICC increased
22% vs. the year ago period driven by strength in macro and
partially offset by weaker securitized products. Equities declined
11% vs. the strong year ago period.
n Firmwide IB fees declined 49% vs. the year ago period and was in-
line with guidance. ECM declined 72%, DCM (-40%) and Advisory
(-31%).
n Other fees like card were a bit weaker, mortgage was higher and fee
income in the Commercial Bank was lower (likely on weaker IB
fees).
n Credit remained strong. Nonperforming assets declined 8% vs. 6/30,
charge-offs rose a modest 11% off low 2Q levels and 30 day card
delinquencies increased 18bps vs. 6/30 (and up 23bps yoy). As noted
above, JPM added $808m to loan loss reserves.
n CET1 was 12.5%, up 30bps vs. 2Q as earnings and RWA mitigation more
than offset dividend payouts and AOCI hits (-22bps). RWAs declined $23b
q/q.
n Mgmt noted being on track to hit 12.5% for 4Q22 and 13.0% for
1Q23. Mgmt expects to resume buybacks (which are currently
suspended) in early 2023.
n SLR remained unchanged at 5.3%. JPM noted it called about $5.4b
of preferreds and issued $3.5b of sub debt as SLR is less of a
constraint than CET1.

disappointing, we believe this creates a buying opportunity. We believe the company's Internet & Digital Media
underlying fundamentals remained intact with continued strong demand for Prime,
Kerry Rice
FBA, and AWS. Both 1P and 3P revenue, as well as total paid units accelerated
during the quarter, driven by continued momentum in Prime membership as retail
subscription revenue accelerated. We believe FBA program continued to gain traction 

both domestically and internationally. AWS continued to grow over 40% y/y. We believe Jinjin Qian, CFA
the company's ongoing heavy investments in fulfillment capacity, video content, and
■
AWS are to match with its substantial growth rates, and should not be viewed negatively.

Amazon reported 2Q17 revenue of $38.0B, representing 25% y/y growth or 26% y/y 
ex-FX, above consensus of $37.2B. N. America revenue was $22.4B, above consensus
of $21.7B, representing growth of 27% y/y ex-FX, an acceleration from 23% ex-FX in
1Q17. International revenue was $11.5B, up 22% y/y ex-FX, in-line with consensus.
AWS continued to ramp with revenue growing 42% y/y to $4.1B in Q2, also in-line
with consensus. Overall, we estimate Q2 GMV to be $79.7B, increasing 30% y/y. GAAP
operating income was $628M in 2Q17, below consensus of $1.1B, primarily driven
by step-up in investments in fulfillment, video content, and AWS infrastructure, as
■
well as increased sales force related to AWS and Advertising.
In terms of revenue mix, retail subscription revenue totaled $2.2B, up 53% y/y ex-FX,
indicating continued growth momentum in Prime membership. According to latest
estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), U.S. Prime members
reached 85M in 2Q17 and 28% of U.S. Prime members are monthly subscribers.
We estimate global Prime members to be over 100M, taking into account monthly
■
subscribers and lower international pricing.
In Q2, third-party (3P) retail revenue continued to outpace growth of first-party
(1P) revenue, up 40% y/y ex-FX, compared to 18% y/y ex-FX for 1P. Both 1P
and 3P revenue accelerated q/q with particular strength in U.S. 3P units grew
Price (USD)
32% y/y and 3P units now represents 51% of total paid units, up from 49% in
2Q16. We believe FBA program continued to gain traction both domestically and
internationally. Management mentioned that Amazon fulfilled units increased nearly
40% y/y while fulfillment center square footage increased by 30% y/y. We believe
company should continue increasing its fulfillment capacity to match with its FBA
demand and expect ongoing heavy investment in Q3 ahead of the holiday season.

 GAAP operating income margin was 1.7% for 2Q17, decreasing 250 bps y/y
from 4.2% in 2Q16. Apart from continued investments in fulfillment capacity,
video content, and AWS, the lower margin this quarter was also driven by a
step-up in headcount which grew 42% y/y and 51% y/y growth stock
compensation. Growth in hiring for AWS and Advertising exceeded overall
company growth, in areas including software engineers and sales.
Management expects seasonally low operating income for Q3, as the
company brings ~80% of this year's fulfillment square footage online, and as
it steps up its video spend both y/y and q/q.
 AWS continued to exhibit strong growth in 2Q17, increasing 42% y/y to
reach revenue of $4.1B, despite relatively recent price reductions Operating
margin for AWS was 22.3%, down q/q from 24.3% due to new price cuts
during the quarter. AWS margin was also impacted by 71% increase in
capital leases as it stepped up its infrastructure investment to match large
usage growth and geo expansion. The company also increased its marketing
expense due to sales hiring. In the long run, however, we believe AWS margin
should continue to trend upwards given increasing utilization and
operational efficiency.
 Amazon guided 3Q17 revenue of $39.25-41.75B, which represents growth of
20-28% y/y, with the midpoint above consensus of $40.0B. GAAP operating
income guidance for 3Q17 was ($400)-300M, below consensus of $931M. We
believe guidance could prove conservative given strong Prime, 3P, and AWS
growth, as well as strong performance of Amazon Prime Day in July.

Needham & Company, LLC employs a rating system based on the following:
Strong Buy: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to outperform the average total return of the broader market as well as the securities in the
analyst’s coverage universe over the next 12 months.
Buy: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to outperform the average total return of the broader market over the next 12 months.
Hold: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to perform approximately in line with the average total return of the broader market over the next
12 months.
Underperform: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to underperform the average total return of the broader market over the next 12 months.
Rating Suspended: We have suspended the rating and/or price target, if any, for this security, because there is not a sufficient fundamental basis for determining a rating or
price target. The previous rating and price target, if any, are no longer in effect and should not be relied upon. This rating also includes the previous designation of ""Under
Review"".
Restricted: Needham & Company, LLC policy and/or applicable law and regulations preclude certain types of communications, including an investment recommendation,
during the course of Needham & Company, LLC’s engagement in an investment banking transaction and in certain other circumstances.
For disclosure purposes, in accordance with FINRA requirements, please note that our Strong Buy and Buy ratings most closely correspond to a ""Buy"" recommendation.
When combined, 73% of companies under coverage would have a ""Buy"" rating and 17% have had investment banking services provided within the past 12 months. Hold
ratings mostly correspond to a ""Hold/Neutral"" recommendation; while our Underperform rating closely corresponds to the ""Sell"" recommendation required by the FINRA.
Our rating system attempts to incorporate industry, company and/or overall market risk and volatility. Consequently, at any given point in time, our investment rating on
a security and its implied price appreciation may not correspond to the stated 12-month price target. For valuation methods used to determine our price targets and risks
related to our price targets, please contact your Needham & Company, LLC salesperson for a copy of the most recent research report.

PepsiCo Inc.
BFY Brands: Healthy “Pop”portunity
Stock Rating/Industry View: Equal Weight/Neutral
Price Target: USD 135.00
Price (02-Dec-2019): USD 135.88
Potential Upside/Downside: -1%
Tickers: PEP
Good evening,
Earlier this evening, PepsiCo announced a definitive agreement to acquire BFY Brands, the parent company of high-
growth, better-for-you snacking brand PopCorners. While we don’t expect the deal to be financially material to 2020
earnings, we believe it has interesting strategic implications for PepsiCo’s broader snacking mandate.
We view the PopCorners acquisition as yet another example of PepsiCo’s efforts to future-proof its Frito-
Lay snacking portfolio…With consumers increasingly embracing “health and wellness” trends, PepsiCo has taken on a
number of initiatives over time to align its snacking portfolio with a growing demand for better-for-you products. This has
included: 1) improving the nutritional profile of its core brand portfolio by the reducing its saturated fat and sodium
content; 2) launching healthier line extensions under existing brand equity umbrellas eg. “Simply” and “Baked!” Tostitos,
Lay’s, Cheetos & Ruffles, and Smart50; and 3) bolt-on M&A (2005: Stacy’s Pita Chips; 2018: Bare Snacks). The acquisition
of BFY Brands is consistent with this strategy, allowing PEP to expand into the popped chips sub-category with a product
line-up including the flagship PopCorners brand as well as brand extensions such as Flex Protein Crisps and Flourish
Veggie Crisps (both launched this year). Notably, the calorie profile of the portfolio PepsiCo would acquire underindexes
both competitor brands on shelf (eg. popchips) as well as the bulk of PEP’s existing better-for-you portfolio (Figure 1).
…with ample opportunity for Frito-Lay to sustain or even accelerate revenue growth for the brand by
leveraging its robust DSD footprint to expand distribution. As a small but fast-growth brand, there is plenty to
play for in terms of incremental distribution opportunity for PopCorners by simply plugging it into PepsiCo’s extensive
direct-store-distribution network. Additionally, we would note that a comparison of the brand’s retail footprint versus
other better-for-you brands, like Smartfood for example, would indicate significant opportunity to capitalize on
distribution opportunities in the convenience and mass channels in particular. Specifically, while PopCorners’ retail
exposure skews strongly toward the Food channel (~76% of sales), SmartFood is more evenly split between Food, Mass
and Convenience (Figure 2).
Financial Terms: As per scanner data, BFY Brands has an LTM revenue base of $53mm and grew +55% over this
period. Assuming the company is able to sustain these levels of growth under PepsiCo’s ownership and that its EBIT
margins track in line with the broader Frito-Lay business, we would expect the deal to be 1c accretive to earnings in 2020
and neutral in 2021. Our math assumes a 30:70 debt-to-cash financing split and a 4.5x LTM EV/Sales multiple (using
Hershey’s acquisition of Pirate’s Booty in 2018 as a corollary), implying an LTM EV/EBITDA multiple of 13x and a purchase
price of ~$240mm.

as the bulk of PEP’s existing better-for-you portfolio.

deemed to be in the same industry (“the industry coverage universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a
particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as
Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the

all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target:
Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's

represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period.
Top Picks:
Barclays Equity Research's ""Top Picks"" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry
(as defined by the relevant ""industry coverage universe""), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that
industry. Barclays Equity Research publishes ""Top Picks"" reports every quarter and analysts may also publish intra-
quarter changes to their Top Picks, as necessary. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their

The Coca-Cola Company
1Q20 First Impressions
Stock Rating/Industry View: Overweight/Neutral
Price Target: USD 56.00
Price (20-Apr-2020): USD 46.53
Potential Upside/Downside: 20%
Tickers: KO
Our Thoughts
KO posted a very strong set of results this morning, albeit against the backdrop of warnings of a very weak 2Q given the
25% volume decline since the start of April and very little visibility as to how trends develop from here. Still, the standout
thing to us for 1Q is the operating profit performance as margins were up +250 bps versus our forecast for a -270 bps
decline. Net sales did benefit by a point each from bottler concentrate inventory build and FX, but this doesn’t account
for the more than 20% profit beat. We have surely expected to see KO cut variable expenses to manage through this
demand pressured environment, but we are very surprised to see this sharp a change in such a short period of time.
Specifically, with the company citing that volumes were tracking +3% through the end of February excluding China, the
implied pull back in “discretionary” spending within one month is remarkable. In supplemental slides provided with the
release, the company did mention “timing of corporate expenses” as a benefit to operating margins but we wonder if this
timing factor will prove dependent on how sales trends develop through the year.
Results
KO just reported 1Q20 Comparable EPS of $0.51, which compares to Consensus $0.44 and Barclays Research $0.41.
Highlights
· Total company organic down just -1% (vs. -3% in our model) on stronger than expected growth in EMEA, North
America and Asia-Pacific and 1 point of bottler inventory build
§ North America organic up +4% (vs. -2% in our model) with unit case volumes up +3% (vs. our -3%) on
strength across water, sports drinks and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar
§ Asia-Pacific organic down -7% (vs. -10% in our model) with unit case volumes down -7% (vs. our -18%)
with 4 points of bottler inventory build
§ EMEA organic down just -1% (vs. -12% in our model) with unit case volume flat (vs. our -4%) including 1
point of bottler inventory build
· Gross margins up +80 bps (vs. our -100 bps) even with price/mix flat
· Operating income up +7% (vs. our -13.5%)
Lowlights
· Global Ventures organic down -2% (vs. our +0.5%) driven by COVID-19 related Costa store closures in China and
the UK with operating margins down -800 bps
· BIG organic down -6% (vs. our +5%) driven by the impact of COVID-19 on India but with operating margins up
+350 bps.
Guidance
· Unable to provide full guidance for 2020 or 2Q20 due to uncertainty related to COVID-19
· 2020:
§ Currency expected to be a mid-single digit headwind to net revenues (vs. 0-1% prior) and high-single digit
headwind to operating income (vs. 2-3% prior)
§ Maintained tax rate at 19.5%

· 2Q20:
§ Currency expected to be a 4-5% headwind to net revenues and 5-6% headwind to operating income

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or
Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are
deemed to be in the same industry (“the industry coverage universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a
particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as
Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the
equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of
all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target:
Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's
expectation of where the stock will trade in the next 12 months. Upside/downside scenarios, where provided,
represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period.
Top Picks:
Barclays Equity Research's ""Top Picks"" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry
(as defined by the relevant ""industry coverage universe""), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that
industry. Barclays Equity Research publishes ""Top Picks"" reports every quarter and analysts may also publish intra-
quarter changes to their Top Picks, as necessary. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their
published research in addition to their Top Pick, there can only be one ""Top Pick"" for each industry. To view the current
list of Top Picks, go to the Top Picks page on Barclays Live (https://live.barcap.com/go/keyword/TopPicks).

Apple Inc. HOLD (AAPL, $101.92, $103 PT)
APPLE EARNINGS REVIEW: THE IPHONE COMPANY.
PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART
The smartphone market, could converge to the growth rate, of the phone market.
Apple reported upside September quarter results that were once again driven by
strong performance in iPhone sales, partially offset by a continued decline in sales of
the iPad. The company reported iPhone unit sales of 39.3 million, growth of 21.8% on
a revenue basis and 16.2% on a unit basis. We mention the unit growth remains
materially below the IDC industry growth rate of 25.3%. Given that Apple is
generating the majority of its revenue and profits from sales of the iPhone, we
mention a few statistics taken from IDC data:
1) The total growth of the mobile phone market (feature and smart phones) was 4.8%
in 2013 (1.82 billion units).
2) Smartphones have passed over 50% of mobile phone shipments, representing
55.1% of total in 2013. Source: finance.yahoo.com
3) The smartphone market itself is slowing, from 46.6% in 2012, to 38.5% in 2013,
the to 25% rate in the June quarter of 2014.
4) Android took 84.7% market share in the June quarter, with iOS at 11.7% and we
do not expect the iPhone 6 to materially change this dynamic.
5) Apple was able to increase its ASP to $605 in the September quarter. This
compares to 58.6% of the Android shipments in the June quarter costing less than
$200 off contract. Apple commands a price more than double the average selling price
of the broader market.
We mention these points to highlight that Apple’s current dependence on iPhone
hardware sales may be a looming headwind. The market dynamics for smartphone
growth is slowing and may converge to the 5% growth rates of the overall mobile
phone market. For us to turn more positive on Apple shares we prefer to see a
stronger recurring revenue stream with a monthly component coming from streaming
music and movie, payments and advertising. We understand the company is
positioning for these markets, and it remains to be seen if Apple can build up a robust
service layer before the smartphone product cycle elongates.
Apple reported September quarter revenue of $42.1B. Revenue grew 12.4% YoY.
Revenue for the FY 2014 was 182 B (+7% YoY) International sales accounted for
61.4% of total revenue in the September quarter and 64.3% for the full year. Apple
returned over $19B to its shareholders in the September quarter.
iPhone: The company sold 39.2M (+12% YoY) units in the September quarter.
Macintosh: Apple sold 5.5M (+25% YoY) Macs during the quarter. iPad: Unit sales
and revenue declined for the third consecutive quarter. iPad revenue was the 5th worst
level of the 18 quarters the product has been in existence, with the only quarters
being lower the initial four quarters at launch. There are now over 50 models of the Company Data
iPad compared to just a handful at launch. Unit sales of 12.3 million were the lowest in
10 quarters, and a warning signal to what the future could hold for the smartphone Price ($) 101.92

Risks
Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment,
tighter credit, negative financial news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance
and operations of the company.
Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile
communication devices, personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating
results could be affected badly in case it is not able to compete in such adverse market conditions.
Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can
lead to additional incurrence of inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s
finances.
Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs
from single or limited sources. This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks.

Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its
products but also for its transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over
production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty.
For additional risks, see the AAPL 10-K filing with the SEC.

Earnings Release Details:
Tuesday, November 17
7:00AM ET Press Release; 8:00AM ET Earnings Call (projected)
Unlike many names in our coverage universe, we believe the bar is relatively low for WMT ahead of earnings on 11/17. Despite the
low bar, the narrative for the last several months has been generally dominated by conversations around WMT’s share trends in
consumables: growth on a dollar comp basis has clearly underperformed conventional retailers, leading skeptics to conclude WMT
has been losing share during the pandemic. While we certainly cannot refute the dollar comp gap discussion versus some of the
conventional food retailers, in a separate report published today, “Fortress” (click here for report), we do a deep dive into share loss
concerns (among a host of other WMT topics), which we strongly believe are short-sighted, as the root causes of share loss, such as
shortened hours, out-of-stocks, and higher prices at competitors, are mostly transient, and will prove irrelevant when shopping
behavior normalizes. In conjunction with our Investment Science colleagues, our report also looks at “share of mind” - or more
specifically change in “visit” share - and this data show WMT is not losing mindshare or visit share. In fact, the data show WMT has
been seeing an acceleration of visits every month since the June 2020 trough. We believe these data are more relevant than dollar
comp comparisons as we look forward because it reflects “mindshare” or “visit” share.
On expectations: In our conversations, it seems that investors are anchoring expectations to credit card data, which
have been reflecting ~MSD U.S. comp trends, although this data may not be accurate considering ~30% of WMT’s
U.S. sales are transacted in cash, and there is a SNAP component that the credit card data doesn’t capture. We are
forecasting U.S. comps of +4.0% in 3Q21 vs. consensus of +4.4%. Our estimates reflect a relatively challenging BTS season, which
will likely be a drag on margins as well as comps, in addition to the COVID cost drag on margins. On the other hand, WMT continues
to make progress on e-commerce profitability given efficiency mix benefits that are sustainable. We expect U.S. EBIT margins down
25 bps in 3Q21 vs. consensus down 5 bps.
As we head into the Holiday season, Walmart has continued to expand its capabilities to elevate the customer experience and
enhance its value proposition. We elaborate on these capabilities in detail in our separate ""Fortress"" report. One recent example is
the “Walmart+” launch, which should result in ecosystem-type frequency/engagement benefits. As WMT’s overall omni-channel
capabilities now stand, we think no one is better equipped than WMT to compete in what will shape out to be a competitive 2020
Holiday season. As we have seen, the cadence of Holiday promotions in the industry has been pulled forward, but we generally
expect a strong Holiday season given the large pool of dollars available from the drop in travel/restaurants spending, and, quite
simply, consumers’ yearning for any semblance of fun/cheer during the Holiday season.
Looking beyond Holidays 2020, the conversation on WMT should quickly shift towards 2021, and we are very constructive on the
trajectory vs. others in this regard. WMT is one of the few retailers we cover that will have easy comparisons next year, so
a potential comp decline should be much less onerous. Walmart+ should also really start to hit its stride next year.
Furthermore, expanded store hours, better in stock positioning, and perhaps most importantly, a return to a more value conscious
mindset on the part of consumers should be major tailwinds. Overall, while we understand the reasons for skepticism today, we are
very confident WMT’s day will come because price will matter again and comparisons next year are relatively easy. Reiterate OW.
Ahead of the Quarter:
We are forecasting 3Q21 EPS of $1.11 vs. consensus of $1.18. WMT has pivoted its focus on making the necessary investments to

serve its customers and workers during the pandemic. Gross margin, incremental COVID-19 related costs, and overall top-line flow-
through will be top of mind as investors are looking to gauge the stickiness of costs and the impact to profitability going forward. The
Street is forecasting a gross margin of 24.5%, flat y/y, while we are estimating a 20bp decline as stimulus benefits fade along with
general merchandise strength. Tailwinds to gross margin to offset mix may include a less promotional environment and less shrink.
SG&A costs are likely to be substantial given WMT’s investment in additional labor and cleaning costs. Consensus estimates overall
SG&A, including both labor and other incremental COVID-19 related costs, to be ~$27.9B vs our ~$27.8B forecast. Despite the near-
term noise on cost, we believe WMT has reacted quickly to serve customer needs and will continue its strong momentum.
What Matters to Us Most:
· QTD comps and traffic by category, including the contribution from e-commerce.
· The health of WMT’s core customer and the impact of COVID-19.
· Any color on FY21 and FY22 outlook.
· Specifics regarding ongoing incremental SG&A costs related to COVID-19.
· Puts and takes on gross margin.
· E-commerce growth and drivers.
· Government stimulus and SNAP impact on sales.
· Flipkart sales growth and operating losses.
· Cost and price inflation environment.
· Pricing gaps/promotional activity vs competitors.
· E-commerce grocery trends.
· Color on Express Delivery reception and expansion plans.
· Color on WMT+ rollout and early uptake.
· Color on the Instacart test
· Update on capital allocation/strategic investment priorities.
· Proceeds from ASDA sale and uses for cash.
· Any color on potential TikTok deal.
Tailwinds:
· Lower shrink in fresh.
· Increased FAH as well as “at home” general merchandise categories.
· E-commerce to remain strong supported by: 1) the rollout of WMT+; 2) rollout of Grocery Pickup locations; 3) the expansion
of same-day grocery delivery to more markets; 4) brand additions and an improved assortment on marketplace; 5) expansion of
NextDay delivery; 6) launch of Express Delivery.
· Online grocery and e-commerce is contributing to average ticket growth.
· Potential share gains as customers look to consolidate shopping trips in stores that can fulfill all needs.
· Increase in spending due to government stimulus and SNAP increase.
· Fewer markdowns as a result of higher sell-through in general merchandise.
Headwinds:
· Substantial SG&A expenses related to COVID-19.
· Reduced store hours due to COVID-19.
· Out of stock challenges.
· E-commerce mix impact to margin.
· Uncertain macro environment.
Guidance: Withdrawn due to COVID-19 uncertainty

Valuation Methodology: Our $160 price target is based on a ~14x EV/EBITDA multiple and FY22 EBITDA of $34.9 billion.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: We believe the long-
term risks for Walmart include: (1) the challenges associated with managing increasingly vast and complex operations, (2) the
growing contribution of the lower-margin food business to the overall merchandise mix, (3) the ability to acquire and successfully
integrate assets abroad, (4) the proficiency with which the company adapts its store formats to the various economic and cultural
environments in international markets, and (5) ability to profitably grow its e-commerce business. Our earnings forecast and
investment thesis for Walmart are subject to such factors as cost of goods, consumer spending and debt levels, currency
fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, store expansion plans, and variability in comparable store sales.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see
definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same
industry (“the industry coverage universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a particular industry coverage universe,
please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive,
Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our
rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its
contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a
12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe
over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage
impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the
Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the
company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target:
Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's expectation of
where the stock will trade in the next 12 months. Upside/downside scenarios, where provided, represent potential upside/potential
downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period.
Top Picks:
Barclays Equity Research's ""Top Picks"" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry (as
defined by the relevant ""industry coverage universe""), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that industry.
Barclays Equity Research publishes ""Top Picks"" reports every quarter and analysts may also publish intra-quarter changes to their
Top Picks, as necessary. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their published research in addition to their
Top Pick, there can only be one ""Top Pick"" for each industry. To view the current list of Top Picks, go to the Top Picks page on

Joseph Galone Million

• Cut target to $197 from $235 based on $1.13 cut to our Calendar 2019

• Estimated a 12.5 million miss on iPhones sold in December quarter
primarily from China. That’s an 18% y/y decline.
• Cut iPhone revenue estimate by $25 billion for Fiscal 2019, which takes
total revenue growth to 0.0%.

Please Read: Important disclosures and analyst’s certification appear in Appendix

We cut our Fiscal 2019 EPS estimates by $1.30 to $12.34 following Apple's pre-
announcement earlier this afternoon. Our new estimates imply 4% EPS
growth in Fiscal 2019 despite an expected 5% decline in Net Income, thanks to
the share repurchase program.
$25 billion iPhone revenue cut to our Fiscal 2019 iPhone revenue estimate
based on a 31.5 million (14%) cut to our estimate of iPhone units sold. Our
estimates now imply a 12% decline in iPhone revenue and 15% decline in units
sold in Fiscal 2019.
12.5 million miss on iPhones sold in December quarter - We estimate iPhone
units sales were less than 64 million in the December quarter, an 18% decline
from last year. That's the largest decline in unit sales since the March 2016
quarter following the launch of the iPhone 6S when unit sales declined 16%.
We expect iPhone unit sales to drop to 42.5 million in the March quarter,
reflecting typical seasonal declines and implying a 19% decline from the prior
year. This is clearly an important metric and one that Apple said they would no
longer report when they issued guidance 63 days ago. It is not helpful to
investors to not report this metric.
Subsidies? CEO Tim Cook primarily cited a weakening economy in China as
the reason for the revenue shortfall and the environment sounds very bad
there and obviously not being helped by the ongoing trade war or the rising
prices of Apple's products. Cook also noted the lack of subsidies by wireless
operators in developed markets. That is not a new trend. On CNBC, Cook
suggested that trade-ins offered by Apple can act as an effective subsidy, but
operators have been offering trade-in promotions for years, albeit at lower
levels in the past two years. (Link) There has not been evidence of an
incremental acceleration in the decline in upgrade rates in the United States or
other developed markets. The replacement cycle might not be rebounding,
but it's very hard to believe that a further lengthening in the product cycle is a
material contributor to the miss reported this afternoon.
0.0% revenue growth is our new expectation for Fiscal 2019, but we believe
Apple can return to revenue growth in the June quarter. Too bad they won't
report that for more than six months.
19% growth in everything else. The huge miss in iPhone was offset by upside
to other segments. In aggregate, Apple’s other product segments generated
$1.75 billion (6%) of upside to our estimate. We estimate that the upside was
generated from wearables, services and iPads as detailed in the tables below.
We adjusted our forward estimates in these segments accordingly.
Gross margin of 38% was at the low end of the guided range and reflected
some contraction from last year. We cut our future gross margin estimates by
50 basis points. Guidance on this line item given the lower revenue
expectations will be critical.
500 million shares could be bought. We are maintaining our expectation that
Apple will buy back ~$20 billion of stock each quarter, but have adjusted the
share repurchase price based on the move in the stock. As a result, we now
expect Apple to buy back 503 million shares in calendar 2019, which represents
11% of the FQ1 share count of 4.77 billion shares.

We cut our price target to $197 from $235 million based on our 15.0x (was
16.5x) our new calendar 2019 EPS estimate of $13.12 (was $14.25). The S&P
500 trades at a 14.4x multiple of expected consensus EPS from FactSet. Our
target also implies a free cash flow yield of 7.3% (was 6.5%).

Overall, while it is unclear how transitory the current backdrop will be, we continue to
be confident in WMT’s ability to execute and manage various P&L levers to drive
ongoing U.S. growth – i.e. WMT can manage product mix, has scale to keep shelves
stocked, has a suite of new high-growth/margin businesses to protect margins (WMT

Barc/Cons estimates of 4.2%/4.3%.
WMT U.S. gross margin decreased by ~12bps y/y due to increased supply chain costs partially
offset by lower markdowns and increased contributions from Walmart Connect. U.S.
operating income grew 5.9% y/y reflecting an EBIT margin of 5.03% compared to our
estimate of 5.19% and consensus at 5.33%. Similar to WMT U.S., Sam’s Club and WMT
International operating incomes increased by 10.2% y/y and 23.9% y/y (excluding divestures
of $404M) respectively – underscoring the strength of WMT’s broad based performance.
Looking ahead, WMT is well positioned for 4Q from an inventory perspective given that WMT
U.S. inventory was up 11.5% y/y at the end of 3Q.
Takeaways from Follow Up Call with Management
 WMT isn’t seeing any metrics that would indicate that inflation has become a problem for
consumers yet.
 Private label penetration has not increased as would typically happen when consumers
become more budget conscious.
 The largest 4Q expense difference y/y for WMT will be the $388M one-time COVID bonus
from last year along with savings on other COVID related expenses.
 2year stack comps improved sequentially each month of the quarter and 4Q comps to
date have remained strong.
 WMT doesn’t believe there has been significant pull forward of holiday demand based on
the business trends they are experiencing.
 SNAP dollars have increased ~10-15% y/y currently at WMT and while there is an
“emergency” component to this increase (which could be eliminated), in theory, this
increase will benefit WMT through September 2022.
 Some capex was shifted into next year due to scarcity of labor to complete projects.
 WMT isn’t anticipating much of a change in the promotional environment in the short
term.
 WMT continues to gain unit market share in grocery – higher market share now vs. 2019
- and is seeing wider price gaps to competitors than pre-pandemic.
 While some bearish investors point to the Walton family selling as a reason to not own
WMT, the family will always look to maintain ~50% ownership. Thus, as WMT buys back
shares, the family only sells to maintain the same ownership percentage.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage
universe"").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative
(see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully
read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"":

Valuation Methodology: Our $170 price target is based on a 13x EV/EBITDA multiple and FY23 EBITDA of ~$38.4 billion.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: We believe the long-term risks for Walmart
include: (1) the challenges associated with managing increasingly vast and complex operations, (2) the growing contribution of the lower-margin
food business to the overall merchandise mix, (3) the ability to acquire and successfully integrate assets abroad, (4) the proficiency with which
the company adapts its store formats to the various economic and cultural environments in international markets, and (5) ability to profitably
grow its e-commerce business. Our earnings forecast and investment thesis for Walmart are subject to such factors as cost of goods, consumer
spending and debt levels, currency fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, store expansion plans, and variability in comparable store sales.

Expectations for April 1
Rated: Buy
WMT, $81.50, NYSE
Investment Opinion: Wage increases, currency translation issues and costs for e-commerce will
constrain EPS growth in 2015, limiting upside prospects for WMT until there are reasons to believe
prospects will brighten. That might occur on April 1st based on announcement of plans Walmart
to run better stores in the US and enable consumers to shop any way they wish.
Shopkeepers Run the Stores
Years ago, CEO Doug McMillon spent a week training at Woolworths Australia, that country’s leading
retailer and came away impressed by Greg Foran’s attention to the details of running stores. When
McMillon headed Walmart’s international operations, he appointed Foran to lead a troubled operation in
China, which now is running well. As CEO of Walmart, McMillon appointed Foran to lead US Walmart.
For the first time in about 10 years the company and US Walmart are run by executives with
experience operating stores. This is making a discernible positive difference in the business.
What We Expect
On April 1st, Foran will announce plans for US expansion and changes to enhance service and
assortments in stores. Much of the discussion may be on how Walmart aims to gain market share
the old fashion way, by building hundreds of stores and improving the merchandising and
customer service in its 3,400 supercenters. It will become clear, we believe, that having shopkeepers
at the helm will increase the potential for increasing US Walmart’s sales and profits.
We anticipate hearing of plans to open Neighborhood Markets at a faster pace, to roll out Click &
Collect sites for pickup of digital orders, and to expand home delivery of food in metro areas and
small towns.
Few if any food and general merchandise retailers will be capable of matching the investment
Walmart is making to integrate stores and digital retailing and to open stores.
We believe a big part of Walmart’s payoff within the next several years will come from a shakeout
of marginal food chains and general merchandise retailers unable to make a complete transition
to the digital era.

Risks
This is a dangerous time for Walmart because it no longer is in sole possession of
advantages that made it great. It cannot afford slip-ups as retailing in the US and
globally change rapidly as e-commerce grows.
Walmart is exposed to a myriad of economic, political, legal and operational risks
across the globe. Economic uncertainties and currency risks may cause a shortfall in
operating results relative to expectations.
The company has significant exposure to legal matters.
A complete recitation of risks can be obtained at www.walmartstores.com/investors.

Price Target
Price Target: $130 from NC
We arrive at a price target of $130 based on the simple average of six valuation techniques (PE, price-to-
book, discount dividend model, PEG ratio analysis and sum of the parts for both PE and PB). Macro
downside risk factors include a slowdown in global economic activity, greater-than-expected increases in
unemployment and bankruptcies (in the US and abroad), and adverse changes in US and foreign laws and
regulations. Company-specific downside risks include higher-than-projected credit losses (especially in
credit cards and home equity but also other consumer areas and commercial lending), market and
interest-rate risks (which can affect JPMorgan's businesses and portfolios in a variety of ways, especially
MSRs and investment securities), and operational risks (primarily associated with regulatory compliance
across the firm's domestic consumer and global wholesale businesses).
Investment Thesis
JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has excelled at both offense and defense over the past decade in which it has been
gaining market share in all major business lines while optimizing its businesses, showing consistent
earnings relative to other global banks and creating a fortress balance sheet (as defined by its CEO).
During this period of covid, playing defense has carried more importance, but greater offense is expected
to play a role as JPM continues to invest long-term. We expect JPMorgan's ROTCE to trend higher from a
low of est. 12% in 2020 to est. 14% in 2022.
Company Description
JPMorgan Chase is a leading global financial services firm with assets of $2.7tn and operations. The firm is
a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial
banking, financial transaction processing, and asset management.

APPLE EARNINGS REVIEW: BUILDING UP THE CHANNEL
PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART
Haiku: While the stock is up, the underlying metrics, are all in decline.
Shares of Apple are up as the company produced June quarter results ahead of low
consensus and issued September quarter guidance ahead of expectations. While the
stock is materially rallying on the results, the underlying metrics that drive our sell
rating are in still intact. These include:
1) Revenue decline of 15% YoY in the June quarter and our expectation of a decline
of 8% in the September quarter, even at the upper end of company guidance.
2) We estimate FY2016 revenue declines 8% and FY2017 revenue declines 1%, and
our bias remains to the downside. We see that it is more likely that the market
for smartphones decelerates than accelerates.
3) September quarter guidance likely includes the benefit of building up channel
inventory, which was decreased in the June quarter by 4 million units.
4) Channel inventory build may negatively impact December quarter results.
5) iPhone revenue declined for the second consecutive quarter, and we estimate Source: Nasdaq.com
that iPhone revenue to decline for the next 5 quarters on a year over year basis.
6) Average selling price for the iPhone dropped 10% YoY and 7% sequentially,
driven by customer interest in lower priced iPhone SE, resulting in the lowest
gross margins in 7 quarters.
7) Operating margin of 23.9% was the lowest in 7 years.
8) Greater China revenue declined 33% YoY and 29% sequentially, and even with
adjustments for currency, we note the market declined in a quarter where the
low cost iPhone SE was released.
9) Only two areas of the company produced revenue growth, iPad and Services.
Services revenue, while touted by management, is only 14% of total. iPad
revenue grew although units sold declined driven by higher ASPs.
10) Domestic cash is down to 7% of total, at $17 billion, a 29% sequential decline,
limiting flexibility as the company returned $13 billion in the quarter, with a
dividend commitment of $3.2 billion per quarter. Debt is $72 billion.
11) Shares keep making lower lows, and lower highs looking back to 2015, and
remains precipitously subject to the consumer whim regarding the iPhone.
12) We give ourselves up to 9 months for the thesis to evolve and price target to be
reached, after which we expect the iPhone 10th anniversary model to reset
demand in the fall of 2017.
As we mentioned in our downgrade, with expectations for the June quarter low, and
consensus at the midpoint of guidance, it was possible that shares rally. However,
when we ask ourselves “Do we see Apple gaining or losing its next $100 billion of
Company Data
value”, the answer remains losing. The reason we picked $100 billion is to
accommodate a rally such as today, and we still see that the dynamics of the next Price ($) 103.41
iPhone cycle is positioned to disappoint the market. The setup of stronger than

Estimates and Valuation
We adjust our FY2016 estimates to:
$8.30 eps and $216B in net revenue
from
$8.21 eps and $212B in net revenue
Our estimates represent YoY revenue decline of 8%. This compares to consensus revenue of $215B. Consensus EPS is
$8.21.
We adjust our FY2017 estimates to:
$8.12 eps and $213B in net revenue
from
$8.24 eps and $209B in net revenue
Our estimates represent YoY revenue decline of 1%. This compares to consensus revenue of $223B. Consensus EPS is
$8.85.
The company operates on a fiscal September year.
Based on our $8.12 EPS estimate for FY2017 and using a 10x multiple, a discount to its peers, we determine a 12-month
price target for AAPL of $85. Given the decline in revenue, and concern on future upgrade cycles, Apple trades at a
discount to the broader market.

Changing Dynamics of the Smartphone Market impacting iPhone sales
The smartphone market is maturing and the days of explosive double-digit growth are likely behind it, similar to the
dynamic for PCs and the Tablets. We recognize that Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated smartphones have only penetrated
42% of the global handset market, but we see the remaining market share not particularly suited for Apple’s product line
up and pricing. IDC shows worldwide smartphone growth flat with shipment of 335 M units (+0.2% YoY) in Q1/16.

After reaching peak shipments in December 2015, even the iPhone has started showing decreasing growth rates. The fact
remains that both the broader smartphone market and Apple iPhone unit growth have been consistently slowing over the
last four quarters.
We do not expect the next upgrade cycle for the iPhone to have the same impact as the iPhone 6 cycle that introduced
larger screens due to the slowing market dynamics and our opinion that the value and desirability of Apple’s premium
priced products is eroding.

We make the point that Apple has no other product with the volume demand and margin structure that could replace the
income statement impact if iPhone sales grow at single digit levels or even decline.
Share Repurchases and Declining Domestic Cash
Apple has been draining its domestic cash via its extensive share repurchase program. The overseas cash now accounts
for 90% of total cash.
We also note that AAPL purchased $40B of stock in the period from January, 2015 till March, 2016 through share
repurchase – which at current valuation is worth $35B eroding the company’s balance sheet of $5B

646.346.7052 cell: 917.921.8616
BGC Financial L.P.
Other areas where we feel that AAPL can foray into includes:
Advertising – Mobile advertising is expected to grow up to 80B over the next 3 years.
Mobile Applications and Streaming Video – Apple has no application in the top 10 smartphone applications per
comScore, compared to Google which has five.

We understand the company is positioning for these markets, and it remains to be seen how long it takes Apple to build a
service layer meaningful enough to offset potential future declines in smartphone revenue.

Risks
Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment, tighter credit, negative financial
news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance and operations of the company.
Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile communication devices,
personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating results could be affected badly in case it is not able to
compete in such adverse market conditions.
Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can lead to additional incurrence of
inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s finances.
Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs from single or limited sources.
This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks.
Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its products but also for its
transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty.
For additional risks, see the AAPL 10-K filing with the SEC.

The risks seem balanced, to the upside and downside, with good news priced in.
Shares of Apple have produced a total return (dividends reinvested) of 42.5% since
our upgrade on April 22, 2013 compared to a total return of the S&P500 index of

to track more in line with the broader market index.
What about the Record Holiday Quarter?
We expect Apple to post an astounding quarter with over 80 million iOS units sold,
powered by the view that the company makes the best products in the space. That
said, we see that the market has already broadly anticipated a record quarter, and
the upside risks seem balanced with downside risks in our view. Yes, we could be
giving away some upside on the reaction to the December quarter print, particularly
if the company can ship 57-60 million iPhones or produce results with revenue and Source: finance.yahoo.com
EPS around $60 billion and $15. That said, we see that expectations are again
possibly overheating, particularly with regard to the opportunity with China Mobile.
Additionally the market dynamic where the functionality gap between products is
closing, while the price gap is widening remains an issue for Apple. Broadly speaking,
the next 1 billion people purchasing smartphones are going to be from demographics
less wealthy than the first billion, and the skew towards lower priced hardware is
likely to continue. We do not suggest that Apple, as a high-end brand, needs to
chase after the low-end market, but we do suggest that the company introduce new
products to its customer base.
Wearables, Beacons, Payments, TVs.
We remain positive on Apple’s ability to introduce wearable products that target the
quantified self, a market we see as a natural fit to the Apple customer base. We are
also positive on the potential for beacons and payments. We appreciate the concept
of ultra-high definition TVs, and the streaming potential for associated content from
iTunes, but caution this type of product may capture less than the 10% market share
suggested by certain investors in a recent SEC filing.
Laggard.
It is also worth mentioning that one can argue that Apple is lagging in critical areas,
with high profile wearable products from competitors already on the market such as
Glass, inexpensive products such as Chromecast linking tablets/phones/PCs to TVs,
and Apple’s approximately 575 million credit cards associated with iTunes an
underutilized asset as it is not being broadly used for other payments.
Valuation. While we appreciate that Apple’s shares may look appealing from a ratio
perspective, trading at 12.3x our FY2014 earnings estimate, we mention again that Company Data
earnings of companies in a fast moving technology landscape can change quickly.
Apple remains that largest capitalized company on a U.S. listed exchange with its Price ($) 552.19

Recommendation
We reduce our rating to HOLD from BUY and maintain our price target of $550 on shares of Apple Inc. The company
reports results on Monday January 27th post market. Our estimate of revenue for December quarter at $57.2B is growth
of 5% YoY and compares to consensus revenue of $57.5B. Our EPS estimate of $14.05 compares to $13.81 in the prior
year and is roughly inline with consensus earnings estimates of $14.08.
Company guidance for the December quarter is $55-$58B in revenue, gross margin of 36.5-37.5%, tax rate to be
26.25%, other income/(expense) of $200M and operating expense of $4.4-$4.5B.
We are estimating 53M iPhones (ASP $595), 25.3 million iPads ($425), 4.8M Macs (ASP $1300) and 10M iPods (ASP $165)
sold in the December quarter to generate $57.2B in revenue and $14.05 in EPS with a gross margin assumption of 37.4%.
Estimates and Valuation
No change to our FY2014 estimates:
$44.72 eps and $185B in net revenue
Our estimates represent YoY revenue growth of 8.2%. This compares to consensus revenue of $185.3B. Our earnings
estimate is $44.72 EPS, which compares to $39.75 in the prior year, growth of 12.5%. Consensus EPS is $43.85.
The company operates on a fiscal September year.
Based on our $44.72 EPS estimate for FY2013 and using a 12.3x multiple, a discount to its peers, we determine a 12-
month price target for AAPL of $550.

Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment,
tighter credit, negative financial news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance
and operations of the company.
Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile
communication devices, personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating
results could be affected badly in case it is not able to compete in such adverse market conditions.
Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can
lead to additional incurrence of inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s
finances.
Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs
from single or limited sources. This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks.
Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its
products but also for its transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over
production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty.
For additional risks, see the AAPL 10-K filing with the SEC.

AMAZON EARNINGS REVIEW: REVENUE GROWTH SERVED WITH MINISCULE PROFITS.
PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART
Haiku: The stock is trading, as if investor patience, has come to an end.
Amazon reported March quarter results in line with expectations, and provided a June quarter
outlook with respectable revenue guidance but disappointing operating income. The stock has
traded down 9% on the results, building on the recent downward trend that has Amazon’s stock
approximately $100 below its all-time high on January 22, 2014. The quarter provided metrics
that support both the positive and negative views on the company. On the positive side, the
company reaccelerated revenue growth to 23% YoY, and issued June quarter guidance that could
show revenue growth up to 26% YoY. Countering the top line growth are the following negatives:
1) The company remains in a constant investment cycle and forecast that June quarter
operating income should result in a loss.
2) Shipping losses as a percent of revenue grew to 5%, and the company spent $2.15 on
shipping cost for every dollar in shipping revenue. With a shipping loss of $980 million in the
quarter, the recently announced prime price increase is only going to be small offset. We
expect the company to push deeper into delivery logistics, and while this may allow same Source: finance.yahoo.com
day delivery, it is likely to represent another major investment initiative.
3) Revenue per employee continues to drop, declining 10% YoY and 38% sequentially.
4) While revenue growth picked up, unit growth remained flat at 25%.
5) The “Technology & Content” expense line grew 44% YoY, materially faster than revenue.
6) Media growth of 8% YoY shows the disruption Amazon faces as content becomes digitized
and shifts to subscription formats. International media growth is anemic at 4% YoY. The
company now sells more digital media units than physical media units in North America.
Amazon reported March quarter revenue of $19.7B in line with our estimate of $19.6B and
consensus estimate of $19.4B, which accounted for 22.8% YoY growth. GAAP diluted earnings per
share of $0.23 was in line with consensus of $0.23. Operating income was $146M in Q114.
Guidance: The company’s June guidance for GAAP operating loss is a range from a loss of
$455M to $55M. Revenue guidance is net sales between $18.1B and $19.8B (+15% to +26%).
North America: North America segment reported revenue of $11.8B in the first quarter for 60%
of total, 26.3% YoY growth and segment operating income of $562M. Segment operating margin
was 4.7% down from 4.9% in the prior year. Media growth in North America was +12.4% YoY
for 23.8% of North American revenue and EGM (electronics and other general merchandise)
revenue grew 27.8% YoY to account for 66% of North American revenue.
International: International segment reported revenue of $7.8B in the first quarter with 18%
YoY growth. Media revenue grew 3.8% YoY to provide 33.5% of total, and EGM grew 27% YoY to
provide 65.8% of total.
Company Data
Media & EGM: Worldwide Media revenue grew 8% YoY to $5.4B and 27.7% of total. Electronics
and Other General Merchandise (EGM) revenue grew 27.4% YoY to $13B. This segment is the Price ($) 308.04

2.8%. Based on our $1.11 EPS estimate for calendar 2014 and using a 329x multiple, we determine a 12-month price
target for AMZN of $365. The company trades at an ultra-premium valuation. We expect more intense competition that
maintains margins at a depressed level, a shift in the media business as other businesses capture digital delivery of
media, increased Kindle competition, or weaker consumer spending is needed for AMZN to experience notable multiple
contraction.
Risks
Competition: Amazon faces competition from various industries like retail, e-commerce services, digital and web
services. These competitors have longer histories, greater resources and brand recognition and more customers, and are
capable of adopting aggressive pricing, securing better terms from vendors and employing more resources for
technology, fulfillment and marketing.
Expansion: The company is witnessing significant expansion in its global operations which has increased the complexity
of the business. This expansion also leads to strain on management, growth, financial, operational and other resources
and also subjects the company to additional legal, financial and business risks.
Fulfillment Centers: It is very important for the company to predict customer demand and optimize and operate its
fulfillment centers successfully, otherwise it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity,
increased costs and impairment charges. This could harm the business.
Seasonality: The seasonal nature of the business puts a strain on the operations of the company. Net sales in the
fourth quarter is disproportionate which leads to inventory, gross profits, net shipping costs and accounts payable being
adversely affected.
Foreign Exchange Risk: The company has significant foreign exchange risk associated with its international websites,
which affects operating results. Further expansion in international operations increases exposure to exchange rate
fluctuations.
For additional risks, see the AMZN 10-K filing with the SEC.

Ticker PEP
A pricing driven year in 2022. PEP's +6% organic sales outlook for 2022 is driven entirely Price Target/Prior: $175.00/NC
by price/mix (CFO Johnston noted PEP will probably ""be around"" 7% pricing). On one end, Upside/(Downside) to Target 3.9%
a year with no volume growth looks conservative in the context of recent momentum Price (02/10/2022) $168.37
and with elasticities still low; that in mind, the two-year stack on volumes of 6% for 2021 52 Week Range $128.32 - 177.24
(on 2021 +4%, 2020 +2%) is historically strong (best in a decade), and compares to 2yr Shares Outstanding 1,382,652,943
stacks of +2.5/1.5/1/2/2.5% in the 5 years prior. A return of mobility could dent the at- Market Cap (MM) $232,797

Nevertheless, a year of +7% pricing (on top of a year with +5% pricing) with historically

ROIC - Current year est. 15%
Ination is building into 2022 - thoughts on the commodity bridge. Per PEP's 10-K, 3 Yr EPS CAGR from current 7%
commodities were a ~14pt hit to op prot in 2021. Some math: Q1/2/3 disclosures were year (unless otherwise noted)
-5/-8/-14% from commodities, which implies that Q4 was a ~26% hit. For COGS, this
would imply commodities in Q1/2/3/421 were a negative -1.7/-2.8/-5.2/-7.1% impact,
$ 2021A 2022E 2022E 2023E 2023E
i.e. an exit rate of over 7%, and our sense is this is building into 2022 with a HSD potential EPS Curr. Prior Curr. Prior
impact to COGS just from commodities. Taking PEP's 7% pricing target (+$5.5bn), and Q1 (Mar) 1.21 A 1.21 E 1.25E 1.32 E NC
assuming commodities a ~9% hit to COGS (-$3.4bn), that'd imply an additional $2bn Q2 (Jun) 1.72 A 1.79 E 1.77E 1.91 E NC
of wiggle room from the pricing. Wages/labor ination is at least +MSD (note: roughly Q3 (Sep) 1.79 A 1.88 E 1.84E 1.99 E 1.98E
half of SG&A is labor). If we assume all of SG&A is +5%, that'd be ~+$1.5bn. Basically, Q4 (Dec) 1.53 A 1.80 E NC 1.93 E 1.94E
that bridge leaves you about +MSD% op prot growth to drop to the bottom-line.
FY 6.26 A 6.67 E NC 7.15 E NC
Productivity could drive upside should SG&A accelerate beyond this level, leaving PEP
P/E 26.9x 25.2x 23.6x
some cushion to deliver, unless volumes come undone. An extra week is also a factor.

NA = Not Available, Volatility = Historical trading volatility
So back to a core concept...stretch vs ex. PEP has the tools to combat 2022 ination,
given pricing power in the business; but, nevertheless +7% pricing is a big number
(historically high, on an already historically high comp) and needed to combat signicant
ination. Basically, it's just harder to make as strong an upside case for earnings.
Rene model for Tropicana deal close. In Q1/2/3/422, we remove
$310/690/940/940mn in Tropicana sales (80/20 NA/Europe), while removing op prot of
$37/70/90/90mn (90/10 NA/Europe). We apply deal proceeds to debt paydown. Latest
net dilution is roughly 12-13c to 2022 EPS per PEP, mitigated by the extra week.

APPLE EARNINGS REVIEW: EXCITEMENT OVER 6% GROWTH
PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART
Haiku: The second quarter, of declining iPad sales, is an adverse trend.
Shares of Apple are trading up approximately 3% after June quarter earnings that
accelerated the trends that materialized in the March quarter. iPhone unit sales slowed
to +13%, compared to the broader market that is likely growing over 25% YoY.
Revenue from iPhone unit sales grew at an even slower pace at 10% YoY, as
customers opted for older models at lower prices. Average selling price declined $35
sequentially and $76 from the December quarter. ASPs of $561 are still materially
above the expected industry average of $314 in 2014 according to IDC. While Apple is
currently enjoying success selling its old model phones into emerging markets, one
has to question the long term viability as competition becomes more aggressive in the
mid and entry markets, offering consumers current model phones at similar or lower
price points, and with a willingness to capture less gross margin. The mix shift to the
older model Apple phones resulted in gross margins of 39.4%, above the company
guidance of 37-38%, and 250 basis points above the prior year June quarter. We
expect the favorable gross margin trends to reverse starting in the current quarter as
the next generation iPhone should have a lower margin profile particularly if the phone
has a sapphire screen. Source: finance.yahoo.com
iPad. The company saw its second consecutive quarter of decline in iPad units sold on
a YoY basis. Unit sales at 13.3 million were approximately half of the December
quarter unit sales. While investors have largely glossed over the decline in iPad
revenue, we mention it is a distinct possibility that Apple may experience declines in
iPhone unit sales after the next upgrade cycle, if consumers lengthen the life span for
smartphones as core features such as LTE, fingerprint scanning, and larger screens
have the potential to satiate the typical customer. Our estimates for the coming
upgrade cycle include some larger numbers such as 59.5 million phones in the
December quarter, a number that may be hard to eclipse in the December 2015
quarterly results.
Channel inventory. We estimate that iPhone channel inventory was kept near
record levels at 15.25 million units, a small decline of 150k units from the March
quarter. We also mention that while the company disclosed the change in channel
inventory, it stopped providing the absolute number. For comparison, the company
reduced channel inventory by 600K units in the prior year June quarter to 11 million
units. The growth of channel inventory at 39% YoY meaningfully outpaces the unit
sales volume of 10% YoY. Using 13 weeks in the quarter, and based on the 35.203
million units sold in the quarter (a pace of 2.7 million units per week), we note that
15.25 million units in the channel represents approximately 5.5 weeks on inventory.
We find it interesting that the company is maintaining channel inventory at the high
end of its 4-6 week range given a product refresh is likely coming.
Apple reported June quarter revenue of $37.4B. Revenue grew 6% YoY. International
sales accounted for 59% of total revenue. Apple returned over $8B to its shareholders
in the June quarter. iPhone: The company sold 35.2M (+12.7% YoY) units in the Company Data
June quarter. Macintosh: Apple sold 4.4M (+17.6% YoY) Macs during the quarter.

Recommendation
We maintain our HOLD rating and increase our price target to $98 from $87 on shares of Apple Inc.
Estimates and Valuation
We increase our FY2014 estimates to:
$6.36 eps and $181B in net revenue
From
$6.24 eps and $181B in net revenue
Our estimates represent YoY revenue growth of 5.7%. This compares to consensus revenue of $181.5B. Our earnings
estimate is $6.36 (post-split) EPS, which compares to $5.68 in the prior year, growth of 12%. Consensus EPS is $6.30.
We increase our FY2015 estimates to:
$6.71 eps and $193B in net revenue
From
$6.55 eps and $191B in net revenue
Our estimates represent YoY revenue growth of 7%. This compares to consensus revenue of $194B. Our earnings
estimate is $6.71 (post-split) EPS, which compares to $6.36 in the prior year, growth of 5.4%. Consensus EPS is $6.89.
The company operates on a fiscal September year.
Based on our $6.36 (post-split) EPS estimate for FY2014 and using a 15x multiple, in line with its peers, we determine a
12-month price target for AAPL of $98. Our previous target was $87.

Risks
Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment,
tighter credit, negative financial news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance
and operations of the company.
Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile
communication devices, personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating
results could be affected badly in case it is not able to compete in such adverse market conditions.
Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can
lead to additional incurrence of inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s
finances.
Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs
from single or limited sources. This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks.
Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its
products but also for its transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over
production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. Equity Research
Price Target
Price Target: $115 from NC
We arrive at a price target of $115 based on the simple average of six valuation techniques (PE, price-to-
book, discount dividend model, PEG ratio analysis and sum of the parts for both PE and PB). Macro
downside risk factors include a slowdown in global economic activity, greater-than-expected increases in
unemployment and bankruptcies (in the US and abroad), and adverse changes in US and foreign laws and
regulations. Company-specific downside risks include higher-than-projected credit losses (especially in
credit cards and home equity but also other consumer areas and commercial lending), market and
interest-rate risks (which can affect JPMorgan's businesses and portfolios in a variety of ways, especially
MSRs and investment securities), and operational risks (primarily associated with regulatory compliance
across the firm's domestic consumer and global wholesale businesses).
Investment Thesis
JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has excelled at both offense and defense over the past decade in which it has been
gaining market share in all major business lines while optimizing its businesses, showing consistent
earnings relative to other global banks and creating a fortress balance sheet (as defined by its CEO).
Decade to date, playing defense has carried more importance but greater offense is needed ahead.
Despite the risk with a transition from optimization to growth, the result should be the greatest value
creation in a decade. We expect JPMorgan's 2020 ROTCE (est. 18%) to be the best in the firm's history on
a risk-adjusted basis during a period of time its cost of capital is declining.
Company Description
JPMorgan Chase is a leading global financial services firm with assets of $2.7tn and operations. The firm is
a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial
banking, financial transaction processing, and asset management.

AMAZON EARNINGS PREVIEW: LOOKING FOR THE CORE BUSINESS TO START TO DRIVE PROFITS
PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART
Shares of Amazon are down over 10% year-to-date after delivering an eye popping return in
2015 of over 117%, driven in large part by the growth and profitability of its Amazon Web
Services (AWS) cloud business. The company just started reporting the segment on a standalone
basis in 2015. While the AWS business surprised with its profitability, we mention that the flip
side is that the core retail business remains essentially unprofitable. This is expected to change
when the company reports December quarter results on Thursday January 28th post market. With
a market capitalization of $282 billion, our take is that the AWS business is priced in to stock. It is
possible that risks to the margin of the AWS business may appear over time if services become
commoditized. We see that the question of generating leverage from the core retail business is
partially driven by controlling delivery costs, with net shipping costs estimated at 4.1% of net
sales, and total shipping losses to exceed $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. We
expect sustained investments in devices, content, and logistics may temper the leverage in the
core business. We also note that Amazon shares are volatile on earnings, moving a minimum of Source: Nasdaq.com
6% over the last 7 quarters.
We estimate revenue for the December quarter to be $36B, which is growth of 22% YoY. Our
earnings per share estimate of $1.71 compares to an earnings per share $0.45 in the prior year
and earnings of $0.17 in the prior quarter and is above the consensus estimate of $1.63.
North America: We expect revenue from the North America segment to be at $21B in the
quarter for 60% of total, +23% YoY growth and segment operating income of $896M. We
expect Media to grow in North America at +14% YoY for 19% of North American revenue and
EGM (electronics and other general merchandise) revenue to grow at 25% YoY, accounting for
80% of North American revenue.
International: We expect revenue from International segment to be $12B in the quarter with a
growth of 12% YoY growth. We expect Media revenue to grow 1% YoY to provide 29% of total,
and EGM to grow at 17% YoY providing 70% of International revenue.
AWS : We expect revenue from company’s Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business
is expected to be $2.5B, for 7% of total revenue and growth of 81% YoY. Company Data

Risks
Competition: Amazon faces competition from various industries like retail, e-commerce services, digital and web
services. These competitors have longer histories, greater resources and brand recognition and more customers, and are
capable of adopting aggressive pricing, securing better terms from vendors and employing more resources for
technology, fulfillment and marketing.
Expansion: The company is witnessing significant expansion in its global operations which has increased the complexity
of the business. This expansion also leads to strain on management, growth, financial, operational and other resources
and also subjects the company to additional legal, financial and business risks.
Fulfillment Centers: It is very important for the company to predict customer demand and optimize and operate its
fulfillment centers successfully, otherwise it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity,
increased costs and impairment charges. This could harm the business.
Seasonality: The seasonal nature of the business puts a strain on the operations of the company. A net sale in the
fourth quarter is disproportionate which leads to inventory, gross profits, net shipping costs and accounts payable being
adversely affected.
Foreign Exchange Risk: The company has significant foreign exchange risk associated with its international websites,
which affects operating results. Further expansion in international operations increases exposure to exchange rate
fluctuations.
For additional risks, see the AMZN 10-K filing with the SEC.

4. At current price, the downside is priced in, and any sign of returning to profit
growth or M&A interest will re-rate the stock – good risk-reward trade.
 SodaStream used to trade at an average PE of 28x, versus present PE of 20x. A
return to the historical growth story implies more than 40% upside.
 At 20x PE, for a revolutionary company with an incredible 3 year net income
CAGR close to 50%, we think downside is limited while waiting on a return to
growth or realization of catalysts.
5. High likelihood catalyst in PEPSI or other major drink brand. As Coca-Cola has
partnered with Green Mountain (GMCR) to start their version of a home
carbonated product, it is likely that PEPSI will need a partner or be left out of the
home carbonation megatrend.
 The market seems to think that Coke/GMCR will wipe the floor with
SodaStream.
 However, we view this as a potential verification that the home carbonating
market is not a fad, but a legitimately growing market. Additionally, this also
sets the ball rolling for other major drink brands to join the home carbonation
market in which SodaStream is by far the market leader with the biggest global
distribution.
How we view this?
 We believe the growth story is still intact, riding on megatrends of health,
customizable, environmentally friendly consumption, amidst gestation losses
while navigating through weak US retail sales to 1H14.
 Soda will still be the king of carbonation and there is space in the rapidly
expanding market for a Coke/GMCR product which rolls out in 2015.
Coke/GMCR activity potentially verifies home soda market is not just a fad.
 SodaStream used to trade at an average PE of 28x, versus present PE of 20x. A
return to the historical growth story implies more than 40% upside.
 Possible catalysts are: successful execution of their logistical optimization
initiatives and geographical growth plans, a continuation of the healthy, low-
sugar, drink customization megatrend, and a better than expected 1H14.
 As a bonus, Soda is also a prime potential M&A/partnership target, as the
Coke/GMCR entry into home-soda may trigger other big drink brands to do the
same, where SodaStream is the most logical choice. For reference, the market
valued Coke’s entry into GMCR with a 40% spike in GMCR share price.
Additionally, PepsI’s takeover of Gatorade (via Quaker Oats) in 2000 was done
at 37x PE.
Valuation
 We liken this investment to a call option, where downside is possible but
limited while there is a better probability of a rerating a year from now, if
evidence of net earnings growth or M&A speculation returns.
 Bullish thesis: A return back to it’s growth story implies a 28x average
historical PE, or $56.
 Bearish thesis: The downside is that earnings growth does not recover to
historical levels and growth remains at single digits, implying a fair price of $36
pegged to 18x FY14 PE (at peer average, growing at single digits).
 SodaStream’s case is likely to be between the bullish and bearish thesis.
Taking an average 3 yr earnings growth rate from 2012-2014 (which includes 2
flat earnings years!) of 16%, we estimate fair value at 23x FY14 PE or $46.
 … with an addition “call” option! A joint venture or partnership with major
drink brand implies a valuation up to 37x or $71.

Investment Action
 We initiate an ACCUMULATE recommendation on SodaStream (SODA) with
12 month target price of $46 (with possibilities to rerate to $56 - $71 when net
income shows hints of catching up to revenue growth or on M&A “strike”). This
represents a potential 12% from its current price of $41. The target price is
based on 23x PE, a 20% discount to it’s historical average PE of 28x, to account
for the possible impairment to SodaStream’s longer term growth rate while still
having a solid story. As an additional bonus: As a potential M&A target, its
M&A valuation is estimated to be 37x FY14 PE, or $70+.
SodaStream announced its 4Q13 results on 26 Feb 2014.

Industry Analysis
Canned Soda Drinks (CSD) shrinking in the US. The overall size of the carbonated
beverage market is estimated by SodaStream CEO David Birnbaum to be a massive
$260B, or 251 billion litres (Euromonitor 2012) in which SodaStream has an
estimated 0.2% and 2% market share of the carbonated soft drinks and sparkling
water category. However, globally, soda drink sales have been shrinking as
consumers turn to water, fruit drinks and healthier alternatives. In the US, Soda is
still a big market, more Americans drink soda than energy drinks and coffee. From
2001 to 2011, annual soda consumption fell 16% but annual bottled-water
consumption soared 56%. North American CSD sales volume dropped 3% in 2013
after falling 1% in 2012. Consumers are choosing more low- and no- calorie
beverages, according to the American Beverage Association spokesperson.
Source: Company Presentation, Euromonitor (2012) for
beverage consumption
The Big Beverage company results corroborate. PepsiCo, which reported
earnings results last week, said carbonated soft drink sales declined by middle
single-digit rates in the fourth quarter. Dr Pepper said its carbonated soft drinks
were down 2% by volume and 4% by sales. Coke’s guidance for diet Coke last
quarter was “under pressure”.
Shifting tastes and drinker’s psychology is SodaStream’s gain. Soda makers are
trying to adapt to changing consumer preferences by marketing “mid-calorie” sodas
that have less sugar than regular drinks but eliminate the artificial sweeteners
typically used in diet drinks. Slow to the game, a recent study indicates that CSD
makers will take 5-10 years to transition into such drinks that suits customer’s
changing taste, while SodaStream has been capitalizing on this trend for the past
few years, as their products targets such consumers. It is apparent that the
American consumer is not abandoning “fizz” per se, but they are abandoning
calories and potentially cancer causing artificial sweeteners and are moving into
alternative drinks. SodaStream allows them to control those calories while
customizing taste levels while providing the fizz in the realms of all types of drinks,
like juices, soda water, seltzer, sodas and alcoholic beverages! SodaStream is not
selling another drink brand; they are selling convenience, sustainability, health &
wellness, value for money and personalization that is grounded in a dominant
CO2 exchange system.
Corroborating health megatrend and CSD declining sales esp. in US is the new
Mexico sugar tax. According to Barry Popkin, a nutrition and epidemiology
professor at the University of North Carolina and author of “The World Is Fat.”
predicts the new tax — 8 percent on most junk food and a peso-per-liter on sugar-
sweetened drinks — will reduce soft drink consumption by 5 percent. That could
well be enough to make the policy very attractive to lawmakers and activists in the
U.S. This bodes well for SodaStream not only because of their operations in Mexico,
but the implications on the Americas’ shift in drink habits.

History: SodaStream THEN
Daniel Birnbaum, CEO of SodaStream gives a insightful summary of SodaStream’s
history and direction in his article in the Harvard Business Review in Dec 23, 2013:
49% CAGR
The basic mechanism for home carbonation was invented in 1903 by Guy Gilbey, a London gin
merchant, who created an apparatus to inject pressurized carbon dioxide into water to make
sparkling water; flavorings could be added to make different kinds of soda. For 50 years or so
the apparatus was used primarily at Buckingham Palace and in other homes for British
royalty; then, in the 1970s and 1980s, it became a popular consumer product. At a high point
in the 1980s, 40% of British households had a carbonation machine. But over the next 20
years the company, which originally operated as a subsidiary of W&A Gilbey, withered. For a
while it was owned by Cadbury Schweppes, which did little to grow a business that could
cannibalize its main product line. In the 1990s an Israeli entrepreneur bought the company,
and by 2006 it was teetering near bankruptcy. There had been no investment, no product
innovation, no international expansion—no growth of any kind.
Source: Company Presentation
Yuval Cohen, a private equity investor, then bought over SodaStream in 2007 and
installed Daniel Birnhaum (then president of Nike’s Israeli business). He continues,
We transformed our mind-set and our focus from a factory to a consumer-centric
organization. Our machine isn’t about putting bubbles into water – it’s about creating a more
economical sustainable, and healthful alternative to regular soft drinks. We redefined our
category. Instead of winning in “home carbonation,” I wanted to grow our share of the $260
billion global soda business. I really liked the idea of competing with Coke and Pepsi. Inside
and outside the company, we began talking about a new cola war.
SodaStream NOW
SodaStream, an Israeli Sodamaker manufacturer, is by far the world leader in a
relatively new market - home carbonation. It operates in 45 countries (21
direct/24 via distributors) with 60,000 stores (15,000 in US with an estimated 6.5
million active households (~1.3m in US). SodaStream was founded in the U.K. in
1903 and pioneered the world’s first home soda maker in 1955. In 2007, Fortissimo
Capital acquires Soda-Club (that acquired SodaStream earlier) and SodaStream was
listed on NASDAQ in 2010. They have had a longer sales history in Europe and only
started selling to US online in 2002. By 2011, their worldwide retail locations
surpassed 45,000 including 7,000 in US. As a testament to being global market
leaders in a new, redefined category, they have achieved stunning 3-yr CAGR of
39% and 49% in revenue and net income accordingly. (This is including FY13’s
disappointing results.) They have achieved this without raising any long term debt
until recently, with a healthy net cash position of $25M on their balance sheet.

SodaStream International Ltd
10 March 2014
Business Overview
SodaStream manufactures home beverage carbonation systems, which enables
customers to easily transform ordinary tap water instantly to carbonated soft drinks
and sparkling water. SodaStream develops, manufactures and sell 1) soda makers,
2) exchangeable carbon-dioxide (CO2) cylinders, and 3) consumables consisting of
CO2 refills, reusable carbonation bottles and flavors. Following a razor & razor
blade model, their soda makers are sold at low margin, to encourage an installed
base for higher margin recurring income from CO2 refills and consumables.
Successfully implementation of their strategy involves having a CO2 retail exchange
and distribution eco-system in close vicinity to the consumer. However, CO2
canisters are considered hazardous and subject to country regulations. In the US,
for example, consumption grade CO2 cylinders are considered hazardous and there
can be no transport of them via air or mail. This building of the retail distribution
partnerships and CO2 exchange eco-system is one barrier to entry.
Business Strengths
Clear and compelling consumer benefits – Their products are environmentally
friendly, convenient, cost effective, promoting health and wellness, and
customizably fun and easy to use. In the United States, estimated cost to a
SodaStream customer, excluding the cost of the sodamaker, of sparkling water is
estimated to be as little as $0.25 per liter and of carbonated soft drinks to be $0.67
per liter, each of which is significantly lower than most bottled or canned sparkling
water or CSD. Based on price studies from Euromonitor 2009, Savings are up to 70%
for sparkling water and up to 30% for CSD. ROI for the active user is estimated to be
within one year.
Promoting health and wellness – Their flavors contain two-thirds less sugars and
calories than leading soft drink brands, and one-third less caffeine than popular SodaStream’s Equity Pyramid

brands. They do not use high-fructose corn syrup and offer diet versions with
Splenda, and without aspartame and saccharin, thus are well-positioned as the
consumer is trending against high calorie and artificially sugared drinks, as
witnessed by declining sales in canned soda.
Customizable, fun and easy to use – SodaStream offers more than 100 different
flavors, including all-natural versions (including cola and ginger ale) and diet
versions. Each member of the family can consume a different flavor, or blend
flavors to make new ones and customize the levels of carbonation. The soda makers
are quick and easy to use, do not require cleaning and does not even require
electricity.
Established presence in certain markets. It operates in 45 countries across 6
continents with 60,000 stores (15,000 in US with an estimated 6.5 million active
households (~1.3m in US) and has been establishing strong brand recognition
among U.S. consumers. In the markets where they operate, they hold the leading
market share position. Their global presence and the depth of retailer relationships
in key markets allos them to better address consumer preference and to enter new
markets more quickly and effectively than many of their competitors.

Innovation. Their ability to bring soda-making into the mainstream through brand
marketing, growing retail distribution, increasing brand awareness with reverse
logistical know-how for CO2 exchange eco-system, and having designer soda
makers won them 23rd place in the world’s most innovative companies of 2013 by
Fast Company (Feb 2013). They were #1 in the food category. They are not just
selling the same old soda from home, they are innovating by introducing the
carbonizing of traditional non-carbonized drinks like Kraft, V8, Welch, Kool Aid, and
Sunny Delight.
Source: Company Presentation
Income model
SodaStream’s business model is to increase the installed base of soda makers, in
order to generate ongoing demand for higher-margin CO2 refills, carbonation
bottles and flavors. When initially penetrating a new market, sales of soda makers
typically exceed sales of consumables. Within a few years, as the initial user base
grows, unit sales of consumables typically exceed unit sales of soda makers by
multples of initial purchases. SodaStream’s principle strategies are (1) to grow the
installed base through new purchases of our products and (2) to maintain consumer
loyalty and “users for life.”

Getting to speed about SodaStream
SodaStream has been on a phenomenal roll. Following a successful Super Bowl ad
campaign, the Israeli sparkling beverage maker reported ~50% sales and net income
growth for 2012 and raised guidance for the year ahead. This was on the back of a 3
year sales CAGR of 47%. The market rewarded investors as the stock climbed 40% in
the following four months.
A year later, the price crashed into a low of $35 in Feb 2014 from a 52 week high of
$75+. The market doubted SodaStream’s future prospects because of the following
reasons: 1) SodaStream's fourth-quarter earnings significantly decelerated to near
zero (causing a full year earnings growth to be flat) due to a flat holiday sales
season, 2) the challenging holiday season forced the company to decide to either
pursue profitability or to aggressively grow its installed base, and 3) soda goliath
Coca-Cola decided to challenge SodaStream on its own turf by buying a 10% stake
in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters to develop their own brand of home-made Coke
branded flavors via the Keurig Cold, to be rolled out in 2015.
Weakened Outlook for FY14
4th quarter weakness due to logistical issues & weak retail. Management reports
that the earnings shortfall was due to lower sell-in prices, higher product costs, a
temporary altered product mix and unfavorable currency fluctuation. They have
also guided gross margins to be approximately 50% similar to 2013 levels. While
majority of Q4 issues have been rectified, main headwinds in 2014 are bigger
depreciation (due to expansion) and unfavorable FX movements.
Muted growth FY2014 guidance. Full year revenue growth is 15% and EBITDA
growth is approximately 11% over FY13, and net income growth is approximately
3% (due to increased depreciation and a increased tax rate from 10% to 12%).
Excluding FX impact, EBITDA would increase approximately by 25%.
First quarter is expected to be challenging from both a top and bottom line
standpoint due to a combination of soft sales, FX headwinds, and higher A&P
expenses from the Super Bowl ad and Scarlett Johansson ambassadorship, as well
as marketing investments in Europe.

Bearish Thesis:
 DIY Sodas are a fad, not a revolution. People will eventually get bored of
them. The 4th quarter weakness is not short term. Rapid expansion has
execution risks.
 Coke’s foray into home sodas will add too much competition.
Bullish Thesis:
 Still managed positive net earnings during 4th quarter retail weakness while
lowering starting kit price to goose up sales base. Performed quite
resiliently considering they had to repackage 600,000 units.
 Continuation of aggressive growth plans, with acceptable stumbles.
 Their installed base is growing, signaling increased future profit
 A continuing megatrend of healthy, alternative drinks which lends itself
well in DIY Sodas.
 Sodastream maintains their position as king of the CO2 exchange
 Coke’s foray into home sodas potentially validates that DIY Soda is a
growing market, it is not a fad. Hence, there is space for both the Keurig
Cold and SodaStream machines.
 Other major F&B players like Pepsi is now under the gun to foray into the
home soda market, in which SodaStream would be the premier partner
choice due to their undoubted market leadership, established business
model and distribution channels.
Thoughts on disappointing Q4 results: Bad, but isn’t that horrible
Sodastream, more or less, still hit it’s ambitious revenue target of $562m (20%
growth), it’s their net income target that fell short (flat growth).
Assuming a constant currency valuation, adj. net income would have been higher.
In FY13, FX had a negative impact on the operating income of approximately
$5.8mn. Adjusting for this impact yields 45.9mn net income vs 42.0mn or +4.5%
growth yoy instead of -4.2%.
Business model has some resilience. They still managed their net income to stay in
the black on large sales despite soft holiday sales, purposeful discounting of unit
sales, and a reconfiguration of 600,000 units of finished goods (Mega packs).
People are still buying despite CSD sales decreasing. Major brands like Coke, Pepsi
and Dr Pepper Snapple have all reported decreasing sales for their CSD in
developed markets, especially in US while SodaStream’s sales have increased by
20% in FY13 - this is commendable. Considering their razor and razor blade model,
increased revenue and slower net income growth implies that they have been
successful in selling more machines, but probably sold less higher margin items like
consumables. Machine sales are a precursor to the more recurrent income growth
of consumables (CO2 and flavors) and actually bode well to the future. Eventually,
when margins recover, net incomes should catch up or exceed revenue growth.

If we tolerate temporary weakness, the company is setting up for future earnings
Operating Growth is still there. Increase in revenues and unit sales in all categories.
Given their cheap printer and higher margin cartridge model, CO2 exchange and
flavors indicate recurring income levels, and machine sales indicate future income
levels, as more machines with more flavors cause growth in multiples. This
potentially explains why the company was willing to sacrifice net earnings for
household penetration.

Unit sales via segment corroborate their sales numbers. All segments have unit
sales increased more than 20%, and the close to 30% FY13 vs FY12 increase in CO2
cylinders is significant, because it shows people are increasing using the product
.
Source: Company presentation
Future income growth looks promising (increasing flavor and delivery partners)
Rapidly growing flavors partners: In the last 4 months alone, they have already
secured numerous traditionally non-fizzy drink brand to partner them to produce
fizzy versions of them. Since October, in 5 months, they have secured – Cooking
Light, Del Monte, Ocean Spray, Welch, Skinnygirl and most recently, Sunny Delight.
Majority are beloved juices to be carbonized which is where consumer sentiment is
headed, and Skinnygirl is a modern alcoholic drink brand. SodaStream is completing
outside of the CSD category as well.
Growing types of distribution: appliance manufacturer Kitchen Aid is producing
soda makers, to be powered by SodaStream. Samsung’s has launched their
sparkling refrigerator also powered by SodaStream. SodaStream is also in nascent
phases of launching SodaStream Professional, designed to compete with traditional
soda machines from bigger competitors, to European test restaurants. In early
2013, almost 350 active units were used in European test restaurants. The
company’s goal is to sell 2000 additional machines in 2014.

Plans to improve gross margins, and sales growth
Company plans to improve margins back to “historical” levels by 2014 by
progressively executing a combination of initiatives. On price, they established
higher margin thresholds for promotional activity, and will be supporting this with
new systems such as central invoicing. On cost, they will be implementing SKU
rationalization, design to cost initiatives, a new global procurement department, as
well as a West Coast filling station and distribution center for their American
business in 2014 which will reduce transportation costs. They will also be expanding
into new geographies, including China, and increasing the availability of
consumables in existing markets, including the timely penetration into grocery and
drug.
If SodaStream can execute these plans effectively, this will increase both the top
and bottom line, and will set up an interesting FY2015 return to improved
profitability. However, 2014 seems to be a gestation period to set up for future
growth and efficiency. Investing in SodaStream now is betting on a recovery closer
to profitability in 2015 due to the continuation of consumer megatrends,
successful execution of multiple sales growth avenues (flavors, delivery and
geography) and logistical optimization of a category leader attempting to redefine
the market, while patiently waiting out the muted sentiment of a low growth
2014.
However, is there still room for major growth? The numbers seem to say yes.
The Potential for Growth is hardly over. The “Revolution” is still at infancy.
Soda & Sparking Water market is still a big market. According to Euromonitor
(2012) for beverage consumption, the carbonated soft drinks market is 220 billion
liters and the sparkling water market is 31 billion liters annually. Sodastream’s
estimated share is only 0.2% and 2% respectively. But this growth potential is
understated as it doesn't capture the opportunity to leverage consumers' desire to
add bubbles to many of their favourite juice drinks such as Kool-Aid, Crystal Light
and Country Time and Ocean Spray.
Awareness rates show potential for growth in the US and Asia. SodaStream re-
launched their re-imagined sodamakers (the Pure and the Penguin) in France, Baltic
Countries, Italy and Hungary by 2008. This was not too long ago and yet they
achieved between 50-68% unaided awareness in these regions. The USA is only at
38%, and Asia is much less than that.

Home-penetration Rates show even more untapped market potential. A
“matured” target would be the whopping 25% household penetration (HHP) in
Sweden. Sodastream is targeting at least a 10% HHP in all countries of operation.
Hence, there is definitely more room to grow. In addition, management states that
in USA there is a “low-hanging fruit” gap of 1-2% household penetration and mid-
teens intent to purchase.
Source: Company Presentation
Untapped relative advertising budgets show great potential. Branded drink
competition is usually centred on advertising, marketing and distribution to
maintain brand equity and drive sales. In 2012, SodaStream’s advertising costs were
$230mn versus Coke’s $9,440mn or less than 3%. This bodes well that product sales
have been rapidly increasing despite relatively low A&P. This year, they have
started their marketing campaign with a bang, recruiting Scarlett Johansson as their
brand ambassador along with a strategically controversial Super Bowl ad campaign.
Reasons SodaStream are market leaders in home carbonation
Barriers to Entry
 First-mover advantage / Brand strength
 CO2 exchange in 60,000 locations and growing
 Expertise in HAZMAT and reverse logistics
 Manufacturing capacity and decades of “know-how”
 Patented leading edge innovation (snap-n-lock, dishwasher-safe,
SodaCaps)
Competition.
By far and away, SodaStream is the premier global DIY home soda maker.
Competition is fragmented, usually isolated to the regions where they operate.
Most competition is not on the whole SodaStream value chain but only parts of it.
The Keurig Cold seems to be the only major challenger. But even so, they are not
competing with the same technology, making SodaStream the king of CO2 cylinder
exchange soda delivery. This implies that there is more space for both competitors.
CO2 cylinders allow the DIY customization to leverage on both the health trend with
taste customization. In addition, of the two, SodaStream is likely the more cost
effective solution to regular club soda / seltzer drinkers.

Insights from Coke’s GMCR foray
Is it a guaranteed home-run? Perhaps not.
Shares of the Keurig maker exploded two weeks ago after Coke took a 10% stake in
the company, and also agreed to provide its entire brand portfolio for the upcoming
Keurig Cold brewing system. However, GMRC is decidedly neither competing with
Soda in the CO2 exchange distribution space, nor with the same type of
customization and personalization. Keurig Cold uses 2 soda pods - one contains the
liquid syrup and the other - a pre-form of carbonation. The pre-measured doses of
drink syrup differentiates the Cold with SodaStream. This simply means:
1) You can get Coke in a slightly more convenient but different form which wouldn’t
be much of an impact to the space SodaStream is operating in as Coke already has
40% of the US soda market and is already readily accessible. Die hard Coke drinkers
already knew that SodaStream cannot replicate the exact Coke experience. Many
SodaStream users also still buy Coke off the shelf as well.
2) This is likely to frustrate bottlers trying to accelerate bottle/can sales, not to
mention carrying execution risk.
3) Successful branded drinks like Coke rely on emotional mythology for competitive
advantage. Die-hard customers have emotional connections with soda that far
exceed the inherent qualities of the soda itself. For these reasons, competition is
often centred around advertising and distribution, and rarely on cost competition
or product innovation itself.
From this point of view, selling their syrup directly to consumers as this may “pull
back the curtain” on their “aura”, as well as cannibalize their existing CSD sales. At
the same time, using home machines departs from the classical act of drinking Coke
which is part of the emotional attachment that makes Coke successful. Die hard
Coke drinkers still love the idea of drinking those shiny red cans from a 6-pack.
5) Coke is already suffering because consumer tastes have changed. The GMCR
partnership will likely add incremental sales, but as demand for Coke falls, so will
demand for the Keurig Cold, and more importantly, its appeal.
6) Coke’s last attempt to create a miniature soda fountain from the home, the
BreakMate, flopped in the early 1990s after great fanfare.
7) SodaStream’s modus operandus in brand market is pretty much the opposite, it
has spent years building brand equity, branding themselves as “rebellious”,
modern, earth friendly with innovation in a bottle in a proven system. Who ever
thought that you could ever drink sparkling Welch grape juice and save the earth at
the same time? For these reasons, it is difficult to estimate how successful the
Coke/GMCR partnership will be in wiping the floor with SodaStream. At the very
least, there are reasons that both can co-exist in the home soda market. In fact,
with a multiple decade lead in home soda making, one can make the argument that
SodaStream is not quite the underdog in this market space as one would think.
8) Is Coke’s foray a validation of the real potential of the home soda market?

Company Valuations
Because we are dealing with a historically high growth company that is trying to
redefine its market, but recently stumbled on weak retail sales and questionable
logistical decisions. We will outline various bullish and bearish cases to qualitatively
estimate potential upsides versus downsides.
Bearish Valuation: 8% longer term NPAT growth
Next years net earnings growth rate is 3%, but revenues are growing at 15%. This
impaired rate is more reflective of future prospects and assumes that the longer
term net income growth rate falls far from historical levels of 39% CAGR to an
estimated 8%. We peg SodaStream’s forward PE to 18.1x major drink brand average
with FY14 reported EPS of 2.02. This is reasonable because as the major drink
brands are having single digit growth and are within the same industry. We arrive
at a target price of $36.
Bullish Valuation: back to 20++% NPAT growth
Company reverts back closer to its historical growth story, after a sleepy 3% FY14
earnings growth, by continuing to redefine their place in the drink industry. Net
income growth catches up with or exceeds their est. longer term revenue growth of
23% after FY14 (which is an average of FY13’s and FY14’s revenue growth). Pegging
forward EPS of 2.02 to historical average PE of 28x when their growth story was
unabated implies a valuation of $57. Taking a 10% discount to this to account for
changed stock market perception due to volatility of great earnings growth one
year and flat earnings growth the next and the introduction of a competitor, we
arrive at $51.
Moderate Valuation: 15% longer term NPAT growth
We think the most likely scenario for net income growth is between the bullish and
bearish case. Though FY14 guidance was muted, there are too many numerous
growth opportunities, potential to improve margins and catalysts to ignore. Taking
longer term earnings growth to be 15% which is also the 3yr CAGR from 2012 to
2014 (which is conservative as it includes 2013 and 2014 reported flat earnings).
Pegging valuations to 23x forward PE, an average of the bullish and bearish case,
we arrive at $46.
… this includes a potential M&A Upside Bonus
Pepsi could be a good fit. There could be many companies interested in buying this
company. Pepsi is simply a logical fit. Pepsi had already recently suggested a foray
into so-called “at-home” drinks such as SodaStream or Green Mountain’s Keurig.
PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said on a Feb. 13 conference call that the company sees
in-home carbonation as “another distribution channel” for carbonated and
sparkling beverages and is “working with multiple people” to be sure it chooses a
partner “who we are sure will commercialize” the product.
Buyout Valuation: After Coke purchased 10% of GMCR for 1.25B, GMCR spiked
gaining 50% since the announcement. That increase equates to a $6B change in
market cap, meaning the market attributes that much value to GMCR on the major
drink brand partnership. By comparison, SodaStream, far and away the market
leader in DIY soda, is worth just $844 million, or just about one-seventh of the
Keurig Cold’s price tag. SodaStream would be arguably more valuable to Pepsi than
GMCR is to Coke considering that buying into SodaStream’s ready product and
distribution channels allows them to get into the home market a year earlier within
a proven system.
Historically, Pepsi had bought Quaker Oats (which owns Gatorade) at about 37x PE .
Valuing SodaStream at 37x PE with est FY14 EPS of $2.02 yields a price target of
$74.

Conclusion
 We believe the growth story is still intact, riding on megatrends of health,
customizable, environmentally friendly consumption, amidst gestation losses
while navigating through weak US retail sales to 1H14.
 Soda will still be the king of carbonation and there is space in the rapidly
expanding market for a Coke/GMCR product which rolls out in 2015.
Coke/GMCR activity potentially verifies home soda market is not just a fad.
 SodaStream used to trade at an average PE of 28x, versus present PE of 20x. A
return to the historical growth story implies more than 40% upside.
 Possible catalysts are: successful execution of their logistical optimization
initiatives, a continuation of the healthy, low-sugar, drink customization
megatrend, and a better than expected 1H14.
 As a bonus, Soda is also a prime potential M&A/partnership target, as the
Coke/GMCR entry into home-soda may trigger other big drink brands to do the
same, where SodaStream is the most logical choice. For reference, the market
valued Coke’s entry into GMCR with a 50% spike in GMCR share price.
Additionally, PepsI’s takeover of Gatorade (via Quaker Oats) in 2000 was done
at 37x PE.
 At 20x PE for a revolutionary company with a compelling growth story, that
used to enjoy a 50% earnings CAGR before this year’s stumble, we think
downside is limited while waiting on a return to growth or realization of
catalysts.Key upside/ downside risks
Upside Risks:
1) Possible partnership with major drink brand.
2) Better than expected sales or net income numbers in FY14 – any suggestion that
growth is returning may cause a rerating.
3) Better consumer retail sentiment in US.
4) The health, customization and alternative drink megatrend continues and
accelerates - small improvements in consumer sentiment towards DIY soda making
have significant upside impact to top and bottom line.
5) Better than expected execution on their top line and bottom line improvement
initiatives

AMAZON EARNINGS PREVIEW: GASP- GROWTH AT A SPECTACULAR PRICE.
PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART
Haiku: Less than one penny, for every dollar of sales, falls to net income.
Amazon reports December quarter results on Thursday January 30 postmarket. We expect the
company to post a revenue growth of 21.4% YoY, its slowest revenue growth in the last 12
quarters. We expect revenue growth in 2013 decelerates to 22.2% from 26.3% in 2012, and
mildly declines again in 2014. While we are fan of stocks that produce growth and have a
reasonable valuation (GARP), and we can also understand the valuations paid for hyper growth
companies that are nascent and chasing large markets, we see that Amazon is exhibiting slowing
growth – at a spectacular price valuation, a combination we coyly call GASP. Amazon has the 17th
largest valuation of the S&P500 index at $176 billion, which we mention as we see the upside is
becoming more limited. The company has the largest P/E ratio at 1,415x earnings for companies
in the US with a market capitalization above 25 billion. The second company is Adobe at factor
lower with a P/E of 100.4x. However, Amazon is ranked 18th in revenue growth using the same
Source: finance.yahoo.com
criteria of US listed companies with capitalization of $25 billion or more. We see that the price
investors are paying is expensive for the current level of revenue growth given the uncertainty
around the degree of leverage that the company may be able to achieve. That said, we also
understand the view that Amazon is going to be the next Wal-Mart, the 8th largest company on a
US listed exchange, and a company that is valued at a market cap 37% above Amazon. However it
may take years for Amazon to grow into this valuation fully.
We estimate revenue for the December quarter to be $25.8B, which is growth of 21.4% YoY. Our
revenue estimate compares to consensus estimates of $26B. Our EPS of $0.54 compares to $0.21
in the prior year and -$0.09 in the prior quarter and is below consensus EPS of $0.67.
Metric estimates. We estimate North America net sales of $15.5B (+27.2% YoY) in the
December quarter, which form 60% of revenue. North America segment operating margin is
estimated at 3.2%. We estimate International net sales of $10.3B (+13.6% YoY) in the December
quarter, which form 40% of revenue. International segment operating margin is estimated at
0.5%. Media revenue is estimated at $7.6B (+16.8% YoY, 29.5% of revenue) and EGM at $16.6B
(+19.8% YoY, 64.6% of revenue). The revenue per employee has been dropping for Amazon in
the last few quarters. We estimate worldwide shipping revenue of $840M, worldwide net shipping
costs of $1.18B (4.6% of worldwide net sales) in Q413.
Guidance: The company’s forward guidance for GAAP operating income or loss in Q4 2013 is a
Company Data
range from a loss of $500M to an income of $500M. Revenue guidance from the company is net
sales between $23.5B and $26.5B (+10% to +25%). Stock-based compensation and amortization Price ($) 396.44
of intangible assets is expected to be $350M. 245.75 - 408.06

Shipping Losses: Worldwide shipping costs were 4.7% of net revenue compared to 4.6% in the

previous quarter and 4.6% in the third quarter of 2012. Shipping losses continue to be an issue for

the company facing razor thin profitability, but it is a mild positive that losses have stabilized as Price Target ($)
percent of total revenue in the last two quarters.
Shares Outstanding (M) 457.0
Balance Sheet: Amazon has $7.6B in cash ($16.82 / share) and $3B long-term debt as of
September 30, 2013. Cash flow from operations was $1.3B in the September quarter. We increase Avg. vol. (3mo) 2,742,740
our FY13 estimates and change our target to $365 from $320 but maintain our HOLD rating.

BGC Financial L.P.
Our estimates compare to consensus of $2.70 in EPS and $91.6B in revenue.
Based on our $0.61 EPS estimate for calendar 2013 and using a 595x multiple, we determine a 12-month price target
for AMZN of $365. Our previous target was $320. The company trades at an ultra-premium valuation, but we expect
more intense competition that maintains margins at a depressed level, a shift in the media business as other businesses
capture digital delivery of media, increased Kindle competition, or weaker consumer spending is needed before AMZN
experiences notable multiple contraction. We do not suggest buying shares of Amazon but see no catalyst on the
horizon that is likely to pull shares materially lower.
Risks
Competition: Amazon faces competition from various industries like retail, e-commerce services, digital and web
services. These competitors have longer histories, greater resources and brand recognition and more customers, and are
capable of adopting aggressive pricing, securing better terms from vendors and employing more resources for
technology, fulfillment and marketing.
Expansion: The company is witnessing significant expansion in its global operations which has increased the complexity
of the business. This expansion also leads to strain on management, growth, financial, operational and other resources
and also subjects the company to additional legal, financial and business risks.
Fulfillment Centers: It is very important for the company to predict customer demand and optimize and operate its
fulfillment centers successfully, otherwise it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity,
increased costs and impairment charges. This could harm the business.
Seasonality: The seasonal nature of the business puts a strain on the operations of the company. Net sales in the
fourth quarter is disproportionate which leads to inventory, gross profits, net shipping costs and accounts payable being
adversely affected.
Foreign Exchange Risk: The company has significant foreign exchange risk associated with its international websites,
which affects operating results. Further expansion in international operations increases exposure to exchange rate
fluctuations.
For additional risks, see the AMZN 10-K filing with the SEC.

PRICE TARGET & ESTIMATE
Momentum Remains High with Strong 1Q18 Results CHANGE
Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)
INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS: BUY
Stock Rating
Amazon posted strong Q1 results with revenue and
$1U,n9c0ha0n.g0e0d
operating income upside. The revenue upside was driven primarily by Amazon's triple
threat of Third-party Sellers (3P), Subscription Services, and AWS. We expect this Price Target
trifecta to power Amazon's growth for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we expect Raised from
$1,700.00
AWS, 3P and Advertising growth to buoy Amazon's operating income. Looking ahead,
while profitability could experience some choppiness from quarter to quarter given
Internet & Digital Media
the timing of investments, we expect consistent revenue growth across Amazon's key
business to continue to power its dominant position in both e-commerce and AWS. We
Kerry Rice
r■ eiterate BUY rating and raise our PT to $1,900.
Amazon keeps growth momentum high in early 2018 with total revenue and 
profitability above consensus. Total revenue was $51.0B, above consensus of $49.9B, 
Jinjin Qian, CFA
with upside coming from 3P, Subscriptions, AWS, and Other. GAAP operating
income was $1.9B, significantly above consensus of $1.0B, driven primarily by
■ 
outperformance in N. America.

Online Stores (aka 1P) revenue increased 13% y/y ex-FX to $29.9B. While solid
growth, Online Stores revenue was modestly below consensus of $27.3B. Due to
the adoption of a new accounting principle that shifted sales of apps and certain
digital content to 3P from Online stores, which reduced growth and revenue. We
expect consistent growth of Amazon's 1P business in the high-teens given its product
■
breadth and investment in its private-label brands.
3P is a powerful engine that should drive growth for the foreseeable future. 3P
revenue increased 39% y/y ex-FX, reaching $9.3B in 1Q18. We estimate continued
growth in 2Q18 of ~35% y/y. Given the net revenue recognition of 3P transaction,
■
we expect the strong growth to contribute significantly to operating income growth.
Subscription Services increased 56% y/y, rising to $3.1B on strength of Prime
Memberships. The company recently highlighted that it had +100M Prime members.
We estimate Amazon has over +125M Prime Members with ~100M in the U.S. The
impact of Prime is evidenced by the rapid growth in Subscription Services. Notably,
Prime members typically spend 2x, shop more frequently, and stay engaged on the Price (USD)
platform longer than non-Prime members. Amazon announced a price increase to
$119 from $99, effective May 11th, which should serve as a revenue growth catalyst
in 2H18. Notably, the company now recognizes Prime subscriptions equally over 12
months, which boosts revenue in the earlier quarters, instead of recognizing a larger
portion of the deferred revenue in Q4.

 AWS revenue growth accelerated by 5pt q/q (now two consecutive quarters
of accelerating growth and margin expanded by 140bps y/y. Management
highlighted that usage grew faster than revenue growth, implying an overall
increase in spending. We believe the rapid pace of rolling out new services
and features was a key driver for usage growth. We believe 1Q18 revenue
growth was also helped by an easier comp due to price reduction in 4Q16.
AWS segment margin expanded 140bps to 25.7%, contributing to $1.4B or
74% of total operating income.
 Other revenue totaled $2.08B in Q1, which consisted primarily of advertising
revenue. With the adoption of a new accounting standard, certain advertising
services are now classified as revenue instead of reduction to cost of sales,
leading to a positive impact of $560M to Other revenue line. Excluding this
impact, other revenue would have been $1.5B, representing 61% y/y growth
and 8.3% upside to our estimate of $1.4B. In addition to being a strong
revenue driver, we believe advertising is also a meaningful contributor to the
90bps margin expansion of the North America segment. We expect the
company to continue investing heavily in advertising, enabling sellers to
reach consumers while at the same driving better a brand and product
discovery experience for consumers.
 Physical stores revenue, primarily from Whole Foods, totaled $4.3B during
the quarter, modestly ahead of consensus of $4.1B. We believe the price
reduction, Amazon lockers, and rollout of Prime benefits helped Whole Foods
post upside. Amazon did not disclose y/y growth for this segment, but a 6%
q/q decline was significantly better than historical seasonal trend, where
WFM’s 1Q17 revenue declined 24% q/q from 4Q16. We expect the company
to continue invest in driving synergy between physical stores and its Prime
membership base and delivery network.
 Management guided 2Q18 revenue to $51.0-54.0B, with the midpoint largely
in-line with consensus of $52.2B, representing y/y growth of 34-42%. GAAP
operating income guidance was $1.1-1.9B, above consensus of $1.1B.

Needham & Company, LLC employs a rating system based on the following:
Strong Buy: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to outperform the average total return of the broader market as well as the securities in the
analyst’s coverage universe over the next 12 months.
Buy: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to outperform the average total return of the broader market over the next 12 months.
Hold: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to perform approximately in line with the average total return of the broader market over the next
12 months.
Underperform: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to underperform the average total return of the broader market over the next 12 months.
Rating Suspended: We have suspended the rating and/or price target, if any, for this security, because there is not a sufficient fundamental basis for determining a rating or
price target. The previous rating and price target, if any, are no longer in effect and should not be relied upon. This rating also includes the previous designation of ""Under
Review"".
Restricted: Needham & Company, LLC policy and/or applicable law and regulations preclude certain types of communications, including an investment recommendation,

When combined, 75% of companies under coverage would have a ""Buy"" rating and 18% have had investment banking services provided within the past 12 months. Hold
ratings mostly correspond to a ""Hold/Neutral"" recommendation; while our Underperform rating closely corresponds to the ""Sell"" recommendation required by the FINRA.

Figure 1 shows our valuation framework for WMT’s Brick and Mortar business. We
estimated the values of WMT’s E-Commerce business (includes Walmart U.S. and Sam’s E-
Commerce businesses, Flipkart, and PhonePe) and also Sam’s Club, then adjusted our total
Walmart enterprise value to derive an implied valuation for Walmart’s brick and mortar
business. While we are not suggesting we look at valuation this way, some investors are –
and as detailed in the figure, the core brick and mortar business, using this methodology, is
only valued in the $196,832 - $251,394M range based on today’s price of $122.23 as of

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage
universe"").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"":

Valuation Methodology: Our $135 price target is based on a ~12.3x EV/EBITDA multiple and FY21 EBITDA of $34.3 billion.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: We believe the long-term risks for Walmart
include: (1) the challenges associated with managing increasingly vast and complex operations, (2) the growing contribution of the lower-
margin food business to the overall merchandise mix, (3) the ability to acquire and successfully integrate assets abroad, (4) the proficiency with
which the company adapts its store formats to the various economic and cultural environments in international markets, and (5) ability to
profitably grow its e-commerce business. Our earnings forecast and investment thesis for Walmart are subject to such factors as cost of goods,
consumer spending and debt levels, currency fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, store expansion plans, and variability in comparable store
sales.

the growth rates to decelerate this year given the larger base, but believe sales could Internet & Digital Media
reach $700-900M. We point to several highlights of this year's event that could propel

growth above our expectations, including extended hours, deeper discounts on Amazon
devices, and discounts on subscription services, and geographic expansion. However,
more than boosting sales, we believe Prime Day continues to be strategic to driving 
Prime membership adoption. With an estimated 85M Prime members, up 30% y/y,

the key is 2x increased spending that comes from members vs non-members. We also

Finally, Prime members typically increase their spending over time.

On July 11, Amazon is hosting its third annual Prime Day. Amazon disclosed that
orders increased 60% y/y worldwide and 50% y/y in U.S. during last year's Prime
Day. While it's difficult to determine the impact of Amazon's Prime Day on revenue,
industry analysts have estimated sales contribution of ~$400M in 2015 and ~$600M
in 2016, a 50% y/y growth. We expect the growth rates to decelerate this year given

More than boosting sales, we believe Prime Day continues to be strategic
to Prime membership adoption. According to Consumer Intelligence Research
Partners' (CIRP's) latest estimate, Amazon now has 85MM Prime members in U.S.
alone, representing growth of 30% y/y from 65MM last year. We expect Prime Day to
continue driving hundreds of thousands of new members as in previous years. CIRP
further highlights that Amazon Prime members on average spend $1300 annually
vs. $700 by non-member customers. We believe Amazon finds Prime members more
readily renew and are easier to retain. Finally, Prime members typically increase
their spending over time. We also believe Amazon aims to drive higher publicity of
its new product categories through Prime Day, such as Alexa-exclusive deals, Prime-
Now exclusive deals, as well as 50% off its private label grocery products.

■
Our price target of $1,150 is based on the sum-of-the-parts analysis, which evaluates North America and International
segments using EV/Revenue multiple, and AWS segment using EV/EBITDA multiple. Our price target is below 7.7x FY17 Sales
Rismkus lttoip Tlea orgf eitts large-cap peers.
■
Risks to attaining our share price target include, but are not limited to: 1) a decline in discretionary consumer spending, 2) slow
adoption of Prime membership internationally, 3) increased e-commerce competition both domestically and internationally,
4) slowdown of revenue and operating margin growth of AWS due to competition and continued pricing cuts, 5) lack of traction
in new products, such as groceries and home services, and 6) potential regulatory changes and uncertainties particularly in
international markets.

Needham & Company, LLC employs a rating system based on the following:

analyst’s coverage universe over the next 12 months.
Buy: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to outperform the average total return of the broader market over the next 12 months.
Hold: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to perform approximately in line with the average total return of the broader market over the next
12 months.
Underperform: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to underperform the average total return of the broader market over the next 12 months.
Rating Suspended: We have suspended the rating and/or price target, if any, for this security, because there is not a sufficient fundamental basis for determining a rating or
price target. The previous rating and price target, if any, are no longer in effect and should not be relied upon. This rating also includes the previous designation of ""Under
Review"".
Restricted: Needham & Company, LLC policy and/or applicable law and regulations preclude certain types of communications, including an investment recommendation,
during the course of Needham & Company, LLC’s engagement in an investment banking transaction and in certain other circumstances.
For disclosure purposes, in accordance with FINRA requirements, please note that our Strong Buy and Buy ratings most closely correspond to a ""Buy"" recommendation.
When combined, 72% of companies under coverage would have a ""Buy"" rating and 17% have had investment banking services provided within the past 12 months. Hold
ratings mostly correspond to a ""Hold/Neutral"" recommendation; while our Underperform rating closely corresponds to the ""Sell"" recommendation required by the FINRA.
Our rating system attempts to incorporate industry, company and/or overall market risk and volatility. Consequently, at any given point in time, our investment rating on
a security and its implied price appreciation may not correspond to the stated 12-month price target. For valuation methods used to determine our price targets and risks
related to our price targets, please contact your Needham & Company, LLC salesperson for a copy of the most recent research report.

finish 2021. Like TSCO appears to be implying,inflation seems to behere to
stay.(2) WMT not seeing meaningful trade down (yet); passing through
more price with gaps slightly wider vs. pre-COVID. WMT has yet to see
anything meaningful in terms of trade down, with private label penetration
flat YOY (though recent Nielsen data suggests a small tick up). Moreover,
we believe the company passed through more price in 4Q compared to 3Q
as a result of cost inflation, noting its price gaps are only “slightly” wider
than pre-COVID with the addition of slightly noteworthy. Like TGT, we
believe WMT acted as a price shock absorber in 3Q and then let more price
through in 4Q (with WMT potentially benefitting YOY in GM rate). As
discussed in our latest group update deep drive, we continue to be wary of
the low-end consumer given the significant step-up of price inflation in the
2H21 as well as SNAP (~160 bps) and Child Tax Credit (120 bps) lap in
2H..

Price Performance Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
We believe WMT is moving with speed and decisiveness
into/through the new world of omnichannel retailing.
However, we find the valuation full and believe that the
hardest part is ahead with its high share in the hyper-
competitive grocery market (25% share) and low share in
general merchandise (~6%) where AMZN dominates online.
Moreover, the company faces stiff comparisons to last year
given abnormal share of wallet in food at home and record
stimulus to thelower end consumer over the past year. Hence,
we remain Neutral on the stockwith our $157 Dec 22 PT

 (3) Strong GM performance in the US driven by price, mix; management
bullish on 2022 outlook. WMT US gross margin was up 54 bps driven by price
management (which could have been positive YOY vs. negative in 3Q),
advertising (15e), and vaccine distribution (25e), partially offset by supply chain
costs. Looking ahead, WMT expects further GM expansion in 2022 driven by
continued pricing actions and contributions from alternative profit pools. Freight
pressures are expected to continue but should moderate throughout the year and
(we believe) become a tailwind to GM in the 2H. We also believe that lapping
significant channel mix headwinds in international could be a benefit in 2H (with
Flipkart’s Billion Dollar Days shifting to 3Q from 4Q a potential operating margin
benefit to 4Q and vice versa). (4) Expecting SG&A deleverage on
wages/investments with more pressure in the 1H. WMT expects overall SG&A
deleverage for the year with more pressure in the 1H as the company laps
significant wage investments in February andSeptember with September the larger
of the two. (5) BJ/TGT Laterals. WMT’s two-year trends seemingly accelerated
in grocery in the US, with gen merch flat and health and wellness decelerating.
WMT US said January was the best on a two-year stacked basis, which bodes well
for OW-rated TGT, which was a key stimulus destination last year. Using the
two-year CAGR trend from Sam’s indicates a ~4-5% comp for BJ, which is
above the Street’s 3.7% forecast.
 Introduces FY23 guidance inline with the street and LTgrowth algorithm.WMT
introduced its preliminary FY23 guide. It expects a +3% net sales increase (4% ex
divestitures), US comp “slightly above” +3% ex fuel (vs. Street +3.0%), operating
income increase about 3% (ex-divestitures, at a higher rate than net sales), tax rate 25-
26%, EPS increase MSD (vs. Street +5%), and capital expenditures at the higher end of
2.5 -3.0% of sales.
 4Q in review:WMT reported 4QEPS of $1.53(+10% YOY)vs. consensus $1.49on a
US comp of 5.6% vs. consensus of 5.4% with US ecommerce growing 1%(for +70%
on a two-year stack). Gross margin was flattish YOY vs. consensus down 30primarily
due to pricing actions, and mix partially offset by higher supply chain costs. US GM
leverageof 54bps was driven by pricing and increased contributions from its growing
digital businesses partially offset by increased costs in the supply chain. WMT US
SG&A was up 95 bps YOY driven by investments in wages partly offset by strong
sales and lower COVID costs benefitting 40bps.
 From a merchandising standpoint, US grocery comps were up HSD reflecting
continued market share gains aided by slightly wider price gaps than pre-pandemic
levels. Health & wellness comps were +mid-teens and gen merch was +LSD with
strength in apparel, automotive, and seasonal items including strong holiday sales
performance.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Walmart Inc(Neutral; Price Target: $157.00)
Investment Thesis
MaintainNeutral.We believe WMT is moving with speed and decisiveness
into/through the new world of omnichannel retailing. However, we find the valuation
full and believe the hardest part is ahead with its high share in the hyper-competitive
grocery market (25% share) and low share in general merchandise (~6%), where
AMZN dominates online. COVID-19 should only accelerate curbside and delivery
investments from its grocery peers, while the CPG category likely just experienced
an inflection online. Hence, we remain Neutral on the stock.
Valuation
Our Dec 2022price target of $157 is based on ~21x our FY23EPS estimate, slightly
below the historical FY1 average given a tough 1H22 setup.

Risks to Rating and Price Target
 Key Upside Risks. WMT’s customersmay prove more resilient than anticipated,
and the company may benefit from trade-down among higher income consumers.
Also, gas prices could benefit more than we currently anticipate. Finally, the
stock may relatively outperform in a tougher market.
 Key Downside Risks.The consumer tends to limit spending on higher-margin and
more discretionary product categories during times of belt tightening. Increased
competitive pricing, including from online-only players, could adversely impact
both sales and merchandise margins. Finally, International profitability could
deteriorate.

New and Forward-looking Statements
 COVID-19: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, JPM invoked resiliency plans in
1Q20 to allow its businesses to remain operational, utilizing disaster recovery sites and
implementing alternative work arrangements globally, including work from home. It also
implemented strategies and procedures designed to help it respond to increased market
volatility, client demand for credit and liquidity, distress in certain industries/sectors and
the ongoing impacts to consumers and businesses. In 2Q20, JPM continued its focus
on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, including developing plans to return
employees to the office. It continues to actively monitor the dynamic health and safety
situations at local and regional levels, and plans remain flexible to adapt as these
situations evolve.
 JPM has continued to support its clients and customers during the challenging
conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including by providing liquidity. Since
March, it has extended more than $350bn of new and renewed credit to its clients and
customers, of which $300bn was in the wholesale businesses. It is participating in a
number of U.S government facilities and programs including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,
and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and the Small Business Administration
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). At 2Q20, JPM had $28bn of loans under the PPP.
In the consumer portfolio, through 2Q20, JPM has provided customer assistance to over
2mn accounts, including refunding over $83mn in fees and granting payment deferrals
on over $79bn of loans and leases, of which $42bn was for third-party mortgage loans
serviced. As of 2Q20 JPM had $28bn of retained loans that were still under payment
deferral. In the wholesale portfolio, through 2Q20, JPM has provided client assistance to
12k clients, primarily risk-rated clients in CCB. The majority of the client assistance was
payment deferrals on $23bn of loans. As of 2Q20, there were $17bn of retained loans
that were still under payment deferral.
 Outlook: JPM’s current outlook for the remainder of 2020 should be viewed against the
backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets
activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer
activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other
countries where JPM does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of
JPM and its LOBs.
 NII – It expects full-year 2020 net interest income, on a managed basis, to be
~$56bn, market dependent.
 Expenses – JPM expects adjusted expense for the full-year 2020 to be ~$65bn.
 Credit Quality: Continued weakness in the macroeconomic environment driven by the
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in an additional increase in the allowance
for credit losses. The continuation or worsening of the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on the macroeconomic environment and the extent to which customer
assistance and government stimulus efforts are effective could result in further impacts
to credit quality metrics, including delinquencies, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs.
 Repurchases: On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, JPM
temporarily suspended share repurchases through 2Q20, and as such, there were no
shares repurchased pursuant to the common equity repurchase program during 2Q20.
In June 2020, the Fed directed all large bank holding companies, including JPM, to
discontinue net share repurchases, at least through the end of 3Q20.
 Consumer Assistance: In March 2020, JPM began providing assistance to customers in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form of payment deferrals.
4 August 2020 3

Barclays | JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Predominantly all accounts that requested payment assistance were less than 30 days
past due at the time of enrollment. Although borrowers are not required to make
payments while still under payment deferral, on 50% of accounts with payment
assistance offered, borrowers have made at least one payment between March 2020
and June 30, 2020. At 2Q20, it had $28.3bn of consumer loans under payment
deferral including $20.5bn of residential real estate, $3.4bn of auto and $4.4bn of
credit card.
 Wholesale Assistance: In March 2020, JPM began providing assistance to clients in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form of payment deferrals
and covenant modifications. As of 2Q20, JPM had $17bn of retained loans still under
payment deferral, almost all short-term, and included $8.8bn in Automotive that it
proactively offered to performing auto dealer clients where the deferral period
ended on June 30, 2020, and the majority of the clients returned to their original
loan terms. JPM continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to
deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are
required to resume making regularly scheduled payments.
 CECL: JPM initially elected to phase-in the January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption
impact to retained earnings of $2.7bn to CET1 capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020
to 2023. As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March
31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the
option to temporarily delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years,
followed by a three-year transition period (“CECL capital transition provisions”). The
interim final rule provides a uniform approach for estimating the effects of CECL
compared to the legacy incurred loss model during the first two years of the transition
period (the “day 2” transition amount), whereby JPM may exclude from CET1 capital
25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD
loans). The cumulative day 2 transition amount as at December 31, 2021 that is not
recognized in CET1 capital as well as the $2.7bn day 1 impact, will be phased into CET1
capital at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. JPM has elected to apply the CECL
capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended 2Q20, the capital
measures of exclude $6.5bn, which is the $2.7bn day 1 impact to retained earnings
and 25% of the $15.7bn increase in the allowance for credit losses (excluding
allowances on PCD loans).
 Economic Assumptions: At 2Q20, its central case assumptions included a 10.9%
unemployment rate at 4Q20, declining to 9.0% by 2Q21 and 7.7% by 4Q21. It assumed
a 6.2% cumulative decline in GDP by 4Q20 relative to 4Q19, improving to a 4.0%
decline by 2Q21 and 3.0% by 4Q21. In 2Q20, JPM placed significant weighting on its
adverse scenarios, which incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than
the central case assumptions above, resulting in weighted average U.S.
unemployment rates remaining in double digits through 1H21. For example,
compared its central scenario described, JPM’s relative adverse scenario assumes a
significantly elevated U.S. unemployment rate through 1H21, averaging 3.6% higher
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of nearly 7% in 4Q20; lower U.S.
real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 4% lower at the end of the eight-
quarter forecast, with a peak difference of nearly 5.5% in 1Q21; and an 11% further
deterioration in the national HPI with a trough in 1Q22.
 Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility: On March 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve
established a facility, authorized through 3Q20, to enhance the liquidity and functioning
of money markets. On July 28, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it was
extending the MMLF through December 31, 2020. Under the MMLF, the FRBB makes
4 August 2020 4

Barclays | JPMorgan Chase & Co.
nonrecourse advances to participating financial institutions to purchase certain types of
assets from eligible money market mutual fund clients. These assets, which are reflected
in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, are pledged to the FRBB as
collateral. On March 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule
to neutralize the effects of purchasing assets through the program on risk-based and
leverage-based capital ratios. As of 2Q20 JPM excluded assets purchased from money
market mutual fund clients pursuant to nonrecourse advances provided under the
MMLF in the amount of $3.8bn from its RWA and $7.8bn from adjusted average
assets and total leverage exposure
 SCB: On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued the final rule introducing a stress
capital buffer (“SCB”) framework for the Basel III Standardized approach that is designed
to more closely integrate the results of the quantitative assessment in CCAR with the
ongoing minimum capital requirements for BHCs under the U.S. Basel III rules. The final
rule replaces the static 2.5% CET1 capital conservation buffer in the Standardized
approach with a dynamic institution-specific SCB. The final rule does not apply to the
Advanced approach capital requirements. The SCB requirement for BHCs will be
effective on October 1 of each year and is expected to remain in effect until September
30 of the following year. On June 29, 2020, JPM announced that it had completed the
2020 CCAR stress test process. Its indicative SCB requirement is 3.3% and the Federal
Reserve will provide JPM with its final SCB requirement by August 31, 2020. The SCB
requirement will become effective on October 1, 2020 and will remain in effect until
September 30, 2021. The SCB will be integrated into JPM’s ongoing Standardized
risk-based capital requirements, increasing the minimum CET1 capital ratio to
11.3% (up from 10.5%).
 CCAR 2020: On June 29, 2020, JPM announced that it had completed the 2020
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) stress test process. Its indicative
Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement is 3.3% and the Federal Reserve Board will
provide JPM with its final SCB requirement by August 31, 2020. JPM’s Board of Directors
currently intends to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend of $0.90 per share
for 3Q20. Additionally, in June 2020, the Federal Reserve directed all large bank holding
companies, including JPM, to discontinue net share repurchases, at least through the
end of 3Q20.
 Brexit: JPM continues to execute on its Firmwide Brexit Implementation program and
remains focused on the following key areas to ensure continuation of service to its EU
clients: regulatory and legal entity readiness; client readiness; and business and
operational readiness. JPM’s Brexit-related planning in 2H20 will focus on the possibility
that the U.K. will complete its departure from the EU without having agreed the terms of
their future relationship, which is commonly referred to as “hard Brexit,” as the July 1,
2020 deadline for the U.K. to request an extension of the transition period has passed.
This will require completion of the relocation of certain front office roles from the U.K. to
EU locations, and finalization of the migration of EU clients and certain positions to EU
entities by the end of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has added incremental risk to its
Brexit Implementation program due to the potential impact on its ability to execute
changes such as relocation of employees given travel restrictions, or the ability of clients
to be operationally ready to the extent that they have diverted resources during 2020 to
address the effects of the pandemic.
 IBOR transition: On March 12, 2020, the FASB issued an accounting standards update
providing optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted
accounting principles to contracts and hedge relationships affected by benchmark
reform. This update provides for various elective options, referred to as “practical
4 August 2020 5

Barclays | JPMorgan Chase & Co.
expedients,” that are intended to simplify the operational impact of applying U.S. GAAP
to certain transactions. JPM expects to apply certain of the practical expedients
relating to the IBOR transition in 2H20. JPM continues to monitor the transition relief
being considered by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and U.S.
Treasury Department regarding accounting and tax implications of reference rate
reform. JPM also continues to develop and implement plans to appropriately mitigate
the risks associated with IBOR discontinuation.
 Legal RPL: Its estimate of reasonably possible losses in excess of already established
reserves ranges up to $1.7bn at 2Q20, up $0.4bn from 1Q20.
 Country exposures: Its exposure to the UK totaled $58.7bn at 2Q20 ($52.6bn at 1Q20).
Other countries of size include Japan ($41.0bn at 2Q20 vs. $47.2bn at 1Q20), France
($26.8bn at 2Q20 vs. $22.4bn at 1Q20), China ($21.2bn at 2Q20 vs. $24.3bn at 1Q20),
Australia ($19.7bn at 2Q20 vs. $20.7bn at 1Q20) and Switzerland ($14.5bn at 1Q20 vs.
$19.1bn at 1Q20). The bank also had $80.8bn in exposure to Germany at 2Q20, vs
$76.0bn at 1Q20.
 Pension: There are no expected contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan
for 2020.
 Criticized assets: The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-
for-sale and loans at fair value, was $39.4bn at 2Q20, up from $21.7bn at 1Q20 and
included $35.1bn ($19.0bn at 1Q20) criticized performing loans and $4.3bn ($2.7bn at
1Q20) criticized non-performing loans. The increase was largely driven by downgrades
in Consumer & Retail and Oil & Gas primarily due to impacts from the COVID-19
pandemic.
 Energy: Exposure to the oil and gas industries was $43.0bn at 2Q20 ($42.8bn at 1Q20).
As of 2Q20, 49% (52% at 1Q20) of the exposure was investment grade.
 Unfunded commitments: JPM provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g.,
commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and
clients. At 2Q20, total lending-related commitments of $1,124bn ($1,081bn at
1Q20) included $45bn ($42bn at 1Q20) consumer ex. cards, $719bn ($681bn at
1Q20) consumer credit cards, and $405bn ($358bn at 1Q20) wholesale
commitments.
 Reclassifications: In 2Q20, JPM reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward
costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net
income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current
presentation.
 Wholesale Payments: In 1Q20, JPM began reporting a Wholesale Payments business
unit within CIB following a realignment of its wholesale payments businesses. The
Wholesale Payments business comprises: Merchant Services, which was realigned from
CCB to CIB and Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was
previously reported in Lending in CIB.
Regulatory developments
 LCR: The LCR rule requires JPM to maintain an amount of unencumbered HQLA that is
sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-
day period of significant stress. For 2Q20, JPM’s average LCR was 117%, compared
with an average of 114% for 1Q20. JPM’s average LCR increased during 2Q20,
compared with 1Q20, primarily due to long-term debt issuances and a benefit from the
4 August 2020 6

Barclays | JPMorgan Chase & Co.
return of funding to the parent company from JPMorgan Chase Bank NA as a result of
the bank’s strategy liquidity position. JPM’s average LCR may fluctuate from period to
period, due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of
ongoing business activity.
Capital & Liquidity
 Capital ratios: JPM’s fully phased-in CET1 under the Basel III Advanced Approach was
13.2% at 2Q20 (12.3% at 1Q20), standardized approaches CET1 was 12.4% (11.5% at
1Q20). JPM’s BHC supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) was 6.8% at 2Q20 (6.0% at
1Q20) and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.’s SLR was 7.9% (6.6% at 1Q20).
 As 2Q20, the SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, as required by the Federal Reserve’s interim final rule
issued on April 1, 2020. JPM’s SLR excluding the temporary relief was 5.7%.
 TLAC: The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the top-tier U.S. GSIB holding
companies, including JPM, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible
LTD. At 2Q20, it had $407.1bn ($387.4bn at 1Q20) of total eligible TLAC and long term
debt and its TLAC ratio was 26.4% (24.2% at 1Q20) above the minimum requirement of
23%.
 Additionally, effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve, in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, reduced reserve requirements to zero percent, which increased JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA by $25bn.
 Broker subs: JPM’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities. At
2Q20, JPMorgan Securities’ net capital was $27.7bn ($17.3bn at 1Q20), exceeding the
minimum requirement of $5.5bn ($5.9bn at 1Q20).
 J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
and has authority to engage in banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities.
J.P. Morgan Securities plc is jointly regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority
(“PRA”) and Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). The Bank of England requires, on a
transitional basis, that U.K. banks, including U.K. regulated subsidiaries of overseas
groups, maintain a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (“MREL”).
As of 2Q20, J.P. Morgan Securities plc was compliant with the requirements of the
MREL rule (same at 1Q20). At 2Q20, J.P. Morgan Securities plc had estimated total
capital of $55.2bn ($53.7bn at 1Q20), its estimated CET1 capital ratio was 17.6%
(16.6% at 1Q20) and its estimated Total capital ratio was 22.5% (21.3% at 1Q20). Both
capital ratios exceeded the minimum standards of 4.5% and 8.0%, respectively.
 HQLA and other liquidity sources: As of 2Q20, HQLA (high-quality liquid assets) was
estimated to be $556bn ($426bn cash, $225bn securities), compared with $548bn at
1Q20. As of 2Q20, in addition to HQLA reported above, JPM has $606bn ($432bn at
1Q20) of unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed
income debt securities, available to raise liquidity. This includes HQLA-eligible securities
forming part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is not transferable
to non-bank affiliates. Furthermore, JPM maintains borrowing capacity at various
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”), the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and
various other central banks as a result of collateral pledged by JPM to such banks.
Although available, JPM does not view the borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve
Bank discount window and the various other central banks as a primary source of
liquidity. As of 2Q20, JPM’s remaining borrowing capacity at various FHLBs and the
Federal Reserve Bank discount window was $281bn ($317bn at 1Q20). This
remaining borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of securities included above in HQLA
4 August 2020 7

Barclays | JPMorgan Chase & Co.
or other unencumbered securities currently held at the Federal Reserve Bank discount
window.
Interest Rate & Market Risk
 Per its simulation model, an immediate 100bp increase in interest rates, would
increase JPM’s 12-month pre-tax net interest income $3.7bn (+$2.8bn at 1Q20).
JPM’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets repricing at a faster rate than
deposits. JPM did not provide an estimate for a 100bp decrease in rates compared to
a $2.0bn decline in pre-tax income at 4Q19. Based upon current and implied market
rates as of 2Q20, scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in negative interest rates.
The U.S. has never experienced an interest rate environment where the Federal Reserve
has a negative interest rate policy. In a negative rate environment, the modeling
assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require additional management
judgment. Additionally, another U.S. dollar interest rate scenario used by JPM —
involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100bps and short-term
rates staying at current levels — results in a 12-month pre-tax net interest income
benefit of $1.7bn ($1.5bn at 1Q20). The result of the comparable non-U.S. dollar
analysis is not material to JPM.
 Net unrealized AFS securities gains were $9.5bn ($5.8bn gain at 1Q20) at 2Q20. Net
unrealized HTM securities gains were $3.2bn ($2.3bn gain at 4Q19) at 2Q20.
 During 1Q20, JPM transferred $26.1bn of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS
from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. These securities were transferred
at fair value in a non-cash transaction. AOCI included pretax unrealized gains of $1.0bn
on the securities at the date of transfer.
 JPM’s total VaR measure using a 95% confidence level averaged $130mn in 2Q20
($59mn in 1Q20) ranging from $106mn to $163mn ($27-$164mn in 1Q20). JPM’s
average Total VaR diversification benefit was $13mn or 9% of the sum in 2Q20 ($12mn
or 17% of the sum in 1Q20).
 Average total VaR increased $71mn in 2Q20, as compared with the prior quarter. This
increase was driven by the substantial increase in volatility in the one-year historical
look-back period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant impacts
were reflected in the fixed income and commodities risk types.
 Effective January 1, 2020, JPM refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to
the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in its own credit spread on
fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-based
measures. This change was made to more appropriately align the risk from changes in
JPM’s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities in a single market risk
measure. In the absence of this refinement, the average Total VaR for 2Q20 would have
been lower by $8mn.
 In 2Q20, JPM observed 2 VaR band break and posted gains on 38 of the 65 trading
days in the quarter.
 Derivative receivables, net of cash collateral and giving effect to legally enforceable
master netting agreements, was $74.846bn at 2Q20 ($81.6bn at 1Q20). Its mix was
49% (45% at 1Q20) interest rates, 17% (23% at 1Q20) FX, 20% (16% at 1Q20) equity,
12% (14% at 1Q20) commodity and 2% (1% at 1Q20) credit derivatives. Liquid
securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables totaled $21.5bn
compared to $26.2bn at 1Q20 (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and
other G7 government bonds), putting total net exposure at $53.3bn ($55.5bn at 1Q20).
4 August 2020 8

Barclays | JPMorgan Chase & Co.
 The weighted-average prepayment speed assumption to determine the $3.1bn fair
value of its MSRs at 2Q20 was a CPR of 19.08% (19.12% at 1Q20). A 10% adverse
change would reduce its MSR by $207mn ($206mn at 1Q20). It assumed a weighted-
average option adjusted spread of 9.10% (8.95% at 1Q20). The impact of a 100bp
adverse change would decrease it by $100mn ($103mn at 1Q20).
Balance Sheet
 Residential mortgage: At 2Q20, JPM’s residential mortgage portfolio included $23.2bn
($22.8bn at 1Q20), of interest-only loans. These loans have an interest-only payment
period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income
borrowers, predominantly in AWM. Performance of this portfolio for 2Q20 was in line
with the performance of the broader residential mortgage portfolio for the same period
(same at 1Q20).
 Effective January 1, 2020, JPM adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The adoption
resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered purchased
credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans under CECL.
 The residential real estate portfolio decreased from 1Q20 primarily reflecting loan
paydowns and loan sales in Home Lending, largely offset by originations of prime
mortgage loans that have been retained on the balance sheet. Net recoveries for 2Q20
were lower when compared with the same period in the prior year as the current quarter
included losses associated with the purchased credit deteriorated portfolio as a result of
the adoption of CECL.
 HELOCs: The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $26.5bn at
2Q20. This amount included $9.9bn of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to
fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $8.7bn of interest-only balloon
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. JPM manages the risk of HELOCs during
their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by
law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.
 At 2Q20, the total Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio was $556.7bn
($397.9bn at 1Q20); the average credit rating of the securities comprising the Treasury
and CIO investment securities portfolio was AA+ (AA+ at 1Q20) based upon external
ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings
that correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s.
Other
 Corporate & Investment Bank compensation expense as a percentage of total net
revenue was 24% in 2Q20 compared with 29% in 2Q19.
 Firmwide headcount was 256,710 FTEs at 1Q20, compared to 256,720 at 1Q20 and
254,983 at 2Q19.
 During 2Q20, JPM transferred $12.5bn ($2.6bn in 2Q19) of securities to agency
VIEs. At 2Q20, JPM did not consolidate any agency re-securitization VIEs or any JPM-
sponsored private-label resecuritization VIEs. It held $4.2bn ($3.2bn at 1Q20) of
interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities.
Mortgage Repurchase Liability
 In connection with JPM’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs, JPM
has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements,
4 August 2020 9

Barclays | JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and that may require JPM to repurchase the mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan
purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by JPM.
 The amount of a recognized mortgage repurchase liability on JPM’s balance sheet
was $85mn, up from $84mn at 1Q20.
Accounting and reporting developments
Accounting standards adopted since January 1, 2020
 Financial instruments - credit losses. Issued June 2016. Establishes a single allowance
framework for financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate of credit losses
over the instrument’s remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in
macroeconomic conditions. Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and requires
recognition of the nonaccretable difference as an increase to the allowance for expected
credit losses on financial assets purchased with more than insignificant credit
deterioration since origination, with a corresponding increase in the amortized cost of
the related loans. Requires inclusion of expected recoveries, limited to the cumulative
amount of prior write-offs, when estimating the allowance for credit losses for in scope
financial assets (including collateral dependent assets). Amends existing impairment
guidance for AFS securities to incorporate an allowance, which will allow for reversals of
credit impairments in the event that the credit of an issuer improves. Requires a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting
period of adoption. Adopted January 1, 2020.
 Goodwill. Issued January 2017. Requires recognition of an impairment loss when the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value. Eliminates the
requirement that an impairment loss be recognized only if the estimated implied fair
value of the goodwill is below its carrying value. Adopted January 1, 2020. No impact
upon adoption as the guidance is to be applied prospectively.
 Reference Rate Reform. Issued March 2020. Provides optional expedients and
exceptions to current accounting guidance when financial instruments, hedging
relationships, and other transactions are amended due to reference rate reform.
Provides an election to account for certain contract amendments related to reference
rate reform as modifications rather than extinguishments without the requirement to
assess the significance of the amendments. Allows for changes in critical terms of a
hedging relationship without automatic termination of that relationship. Provides
various practical expedients and elections designed to allow hedge accounting to
continue uninterrupted during the transition period. Provides a one-time election to
transfer securities out of the held-to-maturity classification if certain criteria are met.
Issued and effective March 12, 2020. JPM expects to apply certain of the practical
expedients related to contract modifications and hedge accounting relationships in
2H20 and does not expect a material impact to the consolidated financial
statements.
Litigation
 As of 2Q20, JPM and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or
respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and
regulatory/government investigations.
 JPM believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in
excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to $1.7bn at
4 August 2020 10

Barclays | JPMorgan Chase & Co.
2Q20 ($0-$1.3bn in 1Q20). Still, for certain cases, JPM does not believe that an
estimate can currently be made, as of 2Q20.
 Litigation expense: JPM’s legal expense was $118mn in 2Q20 and $69mn in 2Q19.
There is no assurance that JPM’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the
future.
Amrapali
 India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly
managed by JPM entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali
Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali
including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to
deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme
Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July
2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that
Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPM entities and the offshore funds
that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money
laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s
Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act
(“FEMA”). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional attachment
order as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings freezing $25mn held by JPMorgan India
Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred to an account held by the
Supreme Court of India. A separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA violations
is ongoing. JPM is responding to and cooperating with the investigation.
Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation
 JPM operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria
(“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held $1.1bn in
connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the
settlement of the dispute, JPM paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in
accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal
Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for $875mn in
payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the
FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving
JPM, but that JPM was or should have been on notice that the payments may be
fraudulent. JPM applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is
ongoing and no trial date has been set.
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation
 JPM previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its
foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those
activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, JPM pleaded guilty to a single violation
of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, JPM was sentenced, with judgment entered
thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has
concluded, with JPM remaining in good standing throughout the probation period.
The Department of Labor has granted JPM a five-year exemption of disqualification that
allows JPM and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset
Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until
January 2023. JPM will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover
the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. A South Africa Competition
Commission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently
pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.
4 August 2020 11

Barclays | JPMorgan Chase & Co.
 In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
granted final approval to JPM’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by
U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based
on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought
damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures.
Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from
the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against JPM and a number of other
foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain
pending. Further, putative class actions have been filed against JPM and a number of
other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign
currencies at allegedly inflated rates and purported indirect purchasers of FX
instruments; these actions also remain pending in the District Court. In January 2020,
JPM and 11 other defendants agreed in principle to settle the class action filed by
purported indirect purchasers for a total of $10mn. That settlement remains subject
to negotiation of final documentation and court approval. In addition, some FX-related
individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have
been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and Australia.
Interchange Litigation
 Groups of merchants and retail associations have filed a series of class action
complaints alleging that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set
the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation
of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a
temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card
network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the
case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the
appellate decision.
 The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily
monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the
parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends
and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the
defendants collectively contributed an additional $900mn to the $5.3bn previously
held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended
agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants filed notices of appeal
of the District Court’s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the
percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $700mn has
been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the
settlement agreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues
separately. In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar
allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against JPM and other banks, and
some of those actions remain pending.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation
 JPM has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around
the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s
investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which JPM and other banks are subject, continues.
In December 2016, the EC issued a decision against JPM and other banks finding an
infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. JPM has filed an appeal
with the European General Court and that appeal is pending.
4 August 2020 12

Barclays | JPMorgan Chase & Co.
 In addition, JPM has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of
individual and putative class actions related to benchmarks, including U.S. dollar LIBOR
during the period that it was administered by the BBA and, in a separate consolidated
putative class action, during the period that it was administered by ICE Benchmark
Administration. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions,
plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later,
defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by
submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in
loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in
these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble
damages.
 In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the
BBA, JPM has resolved certain of these actions and other is various stages of litigation.
The District Court dismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some
plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims,
and permitted certain claims to proceed, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act,
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and common law claims. The plaintiffs
whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal. The
District Court granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest
rate swaps sold directly by the defendants and denied class certification motions filed by
other plaintiffs. In the consolidated putative class action related to the time period that
U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court
granted defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, and the plaintiffs have
appealed. JPM’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR,
the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate, the Singapore Swap Offer Rate and the
Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, and certain of the putative class actions
related to U.S. dollar LIBOR remain subject to court approval. In the class actions
related to SIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR, the District Court concluded that the Court
lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and plaintiffs’ appeals of those decisions are pending.
Metals Investigations and Litigation
 Various authorities, including the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, are
conducting investigations relating to trading practices in the precious metals markets
and related conduct. JPM is responding to related requests concerning similar trading-
practices issues in markets for other financial instruments, such as U.S. Treasuries. It
continues to cooperate with these investigations and is currently engaged in discussions
with various regulators about resolving their respective investigations. There is no
assurance that such discussions will result in settlements. Several putative class action
complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York against JPM and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures
and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act.
Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices
under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these
putative class actions in February 2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through
May 2021. In addition, several putative class actions have been filed in the United
States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of
New York against JPM, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasuries futures and options,
and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints
also allege unjust enrichment. A motion is pending before the United States Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer and consolidate or coordinate the
actions. JPM is also a defendant in a consolidated action filed in the United States
4 August 2020 13

Barclays | JPMorgan Chase & Co.
District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging monopolization of silver
futures in violation of the Sherman Act.
Wendel
 Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of
transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”)
during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a
number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPM has cooperated with the investigation. The
investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in
tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the
mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. In September 2018, the Court of
Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an
ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance
de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel.
In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are
at various stages of proceedings.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage
universe"").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"":

Apple Inc. HOLD (AAPL, $97.67, $98 PT)
APPLE EARNINGS PREVIEW: FOCUS ON SELLING PRICE, MARGINS, IPADS, AND EXPECTATIONS.
PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART
Haiku: It is possible, the iPhone upgrade cycle, starts to lengthen out.
Shares of Apple reached a lifetime high of $103.30 on September 2, 2014, and have
since declined modestly by 5.3%, in line with the S&P500 index which shrank by 5.7%
over the same period when factoring dividends. Looking at Apple’s share performance
chart over the last two years, we mention that the other time that Apple has traded
above the $100 mark was in September 2012. This raises the question, is the
company poised to break out to new life time highs, or could shares be negatively
impacted by overheated expectations and a slowing market for iPads?
While we remain concerned on the iPhone’s shrinking market share, which was just
11.7% worldwide in the June quarter according to IDC (Android was 84.7%), we are
positive on the burgeoning service layer that the company is growing. This includes
Apple Pay, iBeacons, and improvements to iAds in iOS8 that allows for retargeting
consumers. While we still see iAd as a faltering business, the potential when
connected with iBeacons and Apple Pay is impressive. We would like to see the
Source: finance.yahoo.com
company build a robust subscription streaming music (Beats) and video offering to
complement its other products.
iPhone: We expect the company reverses the rather steep recent decline in average
selling price given the product refresh and the addition of the premium priced iPhone
6+ to the product mix. We estimate 38.5M units sold at an ASP of $600 representing
56.7% of revenue. Unit volumes are growth of 13.9% YoY and 9.4% sequentially.
While the iPhone is an impressive revenue and profit driver for the company, unit
volume growth remains materially below the broader market which posted growth of
25.3% in the June quarter according to IDC. Our HOLD rating is driven in part by
concern that the upgrade cycle for premium smartphones may elongate as the current
iPhone provides the core needs for most users (fast connection speeds, biometric
identification, larger screens). Faster and thinner may prove to be a less compelling
reason to upgrade going forward. In our view, we are already seeing an elongation in
the iPad refresh cycle. We expect the upgrade cycle for phones could also be
stretched out by carrier reluctance to continue to subsidize handsets. We are currently
modeling 59.5 million iPhones in the December quarter with an ASP of $655. This
represents unit growth of 17% above the prior record for the company. Apple remains
particularly vulnerable to posting record smashing results but having the outcome
viewed as a disappointment due to overheated expectations.
iWatch. We are adding in the Watch to our FY2015 estimates, with 18 million units at
an ASP of $500. Given the watch is not available for sale, we expect this estimate
could have a wide variance.
Our estimate of revenue for September quarter at $40.8B is growth of 8.8% YoY and
8.9% sequentially. Our revenue estimate is above the consensus revenue of $39.8B.
Our EPS estimate of $1.37 compares to $1.18 in the prior year and $1.28 in the prior
Company Data
quarter, and is above consensus earnings estimates of $1.30.
iPad: We estimate 12.1M units sold at an ASP of $440 for 13.1% of total revenue. Price ($) 97.67
Unit volumes are decline of 14.1% YoY and decline of 8.9% sequentially. iPod: We 52-Week Range ($) 70.51 – 103.74

to reset the market’s expectations of where the stock should be trading.
Capital Return Program
1) Apple expanded its capital return program to over $130B by the end of calendar 2015.
2) Share repurchase authorization increased to $90B from $60B.
3) Apple expects to use $1B per year to net-share-settle vesting restricted stock units.
4) Quarterly dividend increased by 8% ($3.29 per common share). Apple pays $11B annually in dividends.
5) Apple spent $66B (August 2012 to March 2014) as part of its capital return program.

Risks
Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment,
tighter credit, negative financial news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance
and operations of the company.
Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile
communication devices, personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating
results could be affected badly in case it is not able to compete in such adverse market conditions.
Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can
lead to additional incurrence of inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s

finances.
Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs
from single or limited sources. This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks.
Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its
products but also for its transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over
production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty.
For additional risks, see the AAPL 10-K filing with the SEC.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage
universe"").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"":

Valuation Methodology: We value shares of AMZN using a sum-of-the-parts methodology for its retail and AWS businesses. Our valuation of
AMZN's retail business is based on an average of 30x EBITDA and 3x revenue using our FY22 estimates; while we value AWS using 8x our FY22
revenue estimates. Our resulting price target is $4,130.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Downside risks in the short term that could
negatively impact our model and consensus estimates include: 1) greater-than-expected investment levels in retail, and hence lower than
expected CSOI margins, over a more drawn-out period; 2) AWS missing consensus estimates from increased competition or simply because the
Street over-estimated the pace at which on-premise workloads shift to the cloud. We'd put a 40% probability on either of these two risks playing
out in 2017 (recall that both played out in 4Q16 and it didn't seem to matter for shares, which are up almost 4.5% from the day after the print
(vs S&P up 2%)).
Longer-term risks include the highly competitive ecommerce landscape, increasing shipping costs from same and next-day delivery, which could
be a drag on margins, security breaches or frequent downtime in the AWS business which could slow down public cloud adoption, or execution
missteps that could slow growth of the retail business.

Investment Thesis Summary
Transforming from a hardware company to a services company faster than
investors had expected, which isdriving financial and valuation upside
Apple hashistorically been regarded as an IT Hardware company tied to a short
product refresh cycle of the iPhone in an extremely competitive smartphone industry.
More recently, investors have been proved wrong on the pace of Apple’s
transformation to a services company, with revenues in the Services reporting
segment increasing from 8% of total in FY12to an estimated 20% of total in FY21E.
The Services opportunity is currently derived primarily from App Store purchases
and there are multiple emerging drivers, such asApple Music and Apple Pay, which
should continue to drive strong growth. We forecast +23% revenue CAGR for
Services (including comfortably hitting the FY20E Services revenuetargetof $48bn)
with modestly better than company-wide margins to be accretive to profit growth,
and accompanied by higher visibility to revenue and earnings, which we believe
warrants a higher earnings multiple relative to the core hardware business.
Apple Music and Apple Pay levered to megatrends of streaming music and
digital currency, which areemerging growth areas for Services
Apple Music and Apple Pay are key additions to the Apple ecosystem levered to
consumer behavior megatrends in the form of the shift from downloading to
streaming musicand the increasing adoptionof mobile payments. We expect Apple’s
subscription-based Music service to reach >100mnMAUs by FY20E through
increasing penetration of a target market estimated by J.P. Morgan Internet analyst,
Doug Anmuth, to total 2.7bnusers,thusremaining the second largestmusic
streamingservice globally after Spotify. We forecastannual revenuesto grow at a
+41% CAGR to$16bnby FY21E. Separately, Apple Pay is gaining traction with the
installed base and already leads competitive product offerings on Samsung or other
Android platforms. We forecast ~$2.2bnin revenues from Apple Pay by FY21E with
a +48% CAGR,led by the broader industry trend of strong growth in use of mobile
payments and increase in NFC-enabled merchants.
Apple to expand mediaoffering to consumers with the additionof video,
newspaper, and magazine content
We expect Appleto expand its media offering beyond music by adding videoand
print media content, resulting inan all-encompassing Media subscription. We expect
Apple to ramp up its investments in video content steadily starting with ~$1bnin
2018. We expect a steady increase in investments in video content, given Apple’s
focus on differentiation through content rather than encouragement ofcord-cutting.
However, the level of investments is unlikely to reach Netflix’s $8bnand Amazon’s
$5bnover our forecast window (FY21E). We expect Apple to combine the video and
print media offering (through acquisition of Texture) to offer a packaged subscription
at $14.99/month relative to $9.99 for Apple Music anddrive Apple Music
subscribers to upgrade to the packaged subscription, while at the same time growing
the subscriber base at a rapid pace. We estimate Apple’s incremental media offerings
beyond Music to drive an incremental $2.8bnof revenues by 2025.
Missing the forest for the trees: Concerns about iPhone volumes have driven
investors to overlook the robust growth in the installed base
In addition to the increase in service revenue opportunityper device, growth in the
installed base of Apple devices is the other primary contributor to thegrowth in new


Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research

Services revenue. While investors have been concerned about the modest growth in
iPhone volumes, Apple has still been able to drive double-digit increases in the
installed base through a combination of 1) new subscribers; 2) incremental consumer
switching to iOS; and 3) replacement units from existing iOS users making it to the
secondary market (we estimate Apple has a 50% share of the secondary market
relative to 15% of new smartphone market). We estimate atotal installed base of
1.4bndevices in 2017 (~1bniPhones) rising to 1.9bnby 2021or a +7% CAGR.
Pricing power, driven in part by differentiation on technology, will continue to
surprise investors on the upside
Investors have been pleasantly surprised by the limited price elasticity exhibited by
customers, which includes the increase in iPhone volumes despite a +3% pricing
CAGR over the last tenyears (and a higher increase in retail price in certain
countries due to roll-off of carrier subsidies). Consumers have been willing to pay
higher ASPs, due to a combination of: 1) stickiness of the iOS platform (including
smartphonesand accessories like watches) through technology differentiation; 2)
increasing use of financing to pay in installments;and3) push-out of spend on
laptops and tablets. Our analysis reveals that Apple has an exceptional track record of
success with the top-of-the-line smartphone marketed each year and with larger
screen size smartphones (generally priced at a premium), relative toApple’sprimary
competitor in the high-end smartphone category, Samsung. The latest generation of
iPhones launched on September 12, with base prices ranging from $1,099 at the
high-end to $749 at the low-end,is set to continue to drive ASPshigher.
Apple to drive differentiation of the ecosystem through technology leadership
Apple’s portfolio strategy of focusing on design of three iPhone models each year
allows it more bandwidth for resources to drive technology leadership and quality
assurance, which are crucial in maintaining price premium over competitive products
and driving a longer life-cycle of the product (which supports installed base growth).
Apple is already comfortably ahead of competition in relation tofacial recognition
modules. JPM Asia Technology analyst, Narci Chang, expects world facing 3D
Sensing to be adopted on iPhones starting in 2019 (see report), again comfortably
ahead of competition. Similarly, optimism around foldable smartphones has
increased in recent months; we expect Apple to be a fast follower with adoption
starting in 2021 (see report) if it finds theform factor gaining traction with
customers. Apple’s technology leadership drives both new customers joining the iOS
installed base (an estimatedone-third of annual demand) and replacement demand
led by upgrades from existing customers (roughly two-thirds).
Acceleration in revenue growth to be a catalyst for investor sentiment;
buybacks to boost earnings growth further
We expect a +10% revenue CAGR between FY17 and FY21, accelerating from the
+8% CAGR over the last fiveyears, led by a combination of high-single-digit
revenue growth in iPhones and double-digit revenue growth in Services and “Other
Products” revenues. The acceleration in revenue growth should drive investor
attention to the change in the drivers of revenue growth from being primarily led by
iPhone revenues historically, to a balance between iPhone, Services, and Other
Product revenues over our forecast window. We expect the +10% revenue CAGR to
translate into a +17% earnings CAGR over the forecast window (FY21E), through
deployment of capital in share buybacks on a continual basis.


Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018

Enormous capital deployment opportunity provides optionality
The firm’s target of being net cash neutral in the long-run relative to the net cash
position of $129bnat end of F3Q18 and strong free cash flow generated annually
(average of $54bnannually over last fiveyears) provides an enormous opportunity
for capital deployment. However, we believe medium-term upside to our base case
estimates (based on buybacks largely in line with free cash flow) is likely from large
buybacks or acquisitions. For example, we estimate annual buybacks of $100bncan
help Apple can reach close to a cash neutral position by FY21E, with accretion of
~$2.25 to our FY21E EPS. On the downside, however, our base case forecasts
embed largelyflat operating margins, and we estimate the proposed tariffs,if
implemented,could be a modest headwind of 50bpson operating margins medium-
term and moderate our earnings growth forecasts.
Expect M&A to focus on Services opportunities and large installed base; Video
Gaming, Automotive,and Smart Speakers could be potential opportunities
While Apple has historically acquired hardware companies, it has largely been to
bring certain technologies in-house and have the ability to further develop them. We
expect bolt-on acquisitions of hardware companies to continue as the firm continues
to evaluate technology differentiation for future generation of products. However,
recent acquisitions of Texture, and Shazam, are more typical of acquisitions we
would expect Apple to focus on moving forward to further enhance the Services
offering to its existing installed base. Additionally, we do not rule out Apple looking
at other end-markets with a combination of a large installed base and associated
opportunity to deploy services. We believemobile video gaming and the automotive
end-market could be of interest in this regard, in addition to potential interest in the
smart speaker end-market given lackluster performance of the HomePod todate.
Stronger track record of profitability than other technology leaders; yet trading
at only market multiples makes it attractive to both value and growth investors
Interestingly, with annual revenues of $230bn, Apple is ahead of other technology
leaders, including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Netflix (all covered by JPM
Internet analyst Doug Anmuth). In greater contrast, Apple’s $61bnin operating profit
compares to $26bnfor Alphabet, $20bnfor Facebook, $4bnforAmazon, and $0.8bn
for Netflix. Additionally, the firm has a historical track record of much stronger
earnings growth than the S&P 500 index,of which it is the largest constituent at ~5%
weight. However, AAPL shares still trade at 16.6x NTM P/E, modestly below the
market multiple and well below trading multiples of other technology leaders. We
expect the combination of double-digit earnings growth and a trading multiple in line
with the market to screen very attractively for both value and growth investors
(although AAPL ispart of only the S&P 500 growth index).
We rate Apple shares Overweight with solid +23% upside potential to our
December 2019 price targetof $272
We rate AAPL shares Overweight given our favorable outlook on iPhone and
Services revenues relative to investor expectations, catalysts toaccelerate revenue
growth, and upside risk to our base forecast for +18% earnings CAGR. We expect
increasing appreciation of acceleration in growth, along with greater visibility into
earnings and cash flow with increasing mix of Services,to drive a modest re-rating,
from NTM trading multiple of 16.6x to a 17.5x blended P/E, which we arrive at a
based on a SOTP methodology using 14.0x P/E for iPhones, 11.0x for Mac and iPad
devices, 26.0xfor Services, 25.0x for Apple Watch, and 16.0x for Other Products.
We see +23% upside to our December 2019 price targetof $272.

Risks to Rating and Price Target
Industry Downside Risks
Deceleration or contraction in the handset and smartphone market could be
faster than expected
Economic conditions or shifting consumer demand could cause greater-than-
expected deceleration or contraction in the handset and smartphone markets. This
would negatively impact Apple’s prospects for growth, and the shares may fail to
achieveour target price as a result.
Increase in competitive pressures in international markets
Apple is increasingly participating in internationalmarkets, such as China and India,
where local players, which are better situated, could leverage their position and pull
on levers such as pricing to make the market more competitive. In addition,tariffs
enactedby local governments may further hurt Apple’s ability to effectively compete
in international markets.
Company-Specific Downside Risks
Investment in new business strategies and acquisitionscould be fruitless
Apple has historically invested in new business strategies and acquisitions. As such,
success on these investments has low visibility at this time and could lead to greater-
than-expected liabilities andexpense. Additionally, new investments could have a
negative impact on current operations by distracting management.
Key man risk around departure of chief executive officer
While risks related to departure of management executives is considerably lower
relative to in the past, we believe the execution on strategic priorities under CEO Tim
Cook’s leadership does still present modest risk to the share price, although we see a
strong group of executives to support business performance without disruptions.
Litigation with Qualcomm could drive unexpected liabilities
As part of risk mitigation from the ongoing litigation with Qualcomm, Apple has
provisioned what management believes could be worst-case payments to Qualcomm
in the event of an adverse judgement. However, less favorable outcomes with greater
damages awarded to Qualcomm could be a liability for Apple beyond the provisions,
and drive downside to our price target.

Key Themes for AAPL Stock
Transformation to Services Faster than Expected
Forecast Services to grow to one-fifth of revenues by FY21E
Investors have been pleasantly surprised on the pace of transformation to Services,
particularly given the size of the hardware business with ~215mnsmartphone units
sold annually. However, with strong double-digit growth (+18%) CAGR over the last
five years, Apple has more than doubled the FY12 revenue of $13bnby FY17
($30bn). We forecast a modestly stronger +23% CAGR through FY21E, including
comfortably achieving its target of doubling the FY16 revenue of $24bnby FY20E
(JPMe $56bn). Growth will be drivenboth by increase in the installed base from
1.4bndevices in FY17 to 1.9bnby FY21E at a +7% CAGR, and an increase in
service revenue per installed device at a 16% CAGR.

Apple Music to account for $30bnby 2025, led by strong subscriber growth
Apple’s Music service, based on monthly subscriptions, is second only to Spotify
globally and we see adequate room for growth for both players in a market where
consumers are switching to streaming services relative to download purchases.
Streaming revenues for the industry have grown at a +59% CAGR since 2012 and
we expect the same to continue withApple Music gaining further penetration of the
estimated (by J.P. Morgan Internet analyst, Doug Anmuth) TAM globally of 2.7bn
users relative to its current subscriber base of >50mn. We expect Apple to reach
106mnsubscribers by FY20 and 262mnby FY25, accounting for an estimated $30bn
of revenues by FY25.

Media services, including original video, to be the next big driver for Apple
News reports (see link) indicate that Apple is looking to invest around $1bninto
original video programming initially to drive exclusive content and we expect
investments to steadily ramp further over time. However, investments willremain
lower than Netflix’s $8bnand Amazon’s $5bnlevels through our forecast window
(FY21E),primarily as Apple is looking to add exclusive content to the media
platform rather than position itself as an alternative to cable,Netflix or Amazon
Prime. Additionally, we expect Apple to add print media subscriptions, building on
the recent acquisition of Texture to further enhance the services offering. We believe
Appleis likely to look to consolidate the media services by tying together existing
Music services and original video and print media. We expect the Apple Media
subscription to be priced at a premium to the existing Music subscription; we assume
pricing of $14.99 for individual subscriptions (vs. $9.99 for Music) and $19.99 for
family subscriptions (vs. $14.99 for Music). We also expect 35% of Apple Music
subscribers to upgrade to the all-encompassing Media service by FY25E, and
account for an incremental $3bnof revenue in FY25E.

Apple Pay leveraged to growth in mobile payments globally
We see Apple Pay as a key component in the Services portfolio which is positioned
for significant growth in the coming years with the increasing adoption of mobile
payments globally. eMarketer forecasts global mobile payment users amounted to
721mnin 2017and are expected to expand at a+13% CAGR to greater than 1bn
globally in 2020. In consumer surveys, Apple Pay has had stand-out feedback with
materially better adoption withininstalled base of devices relative to other competing
platforms on Android devices, including those of primary premium smartphone
competitor, Samsung. We expect Apple Pay revenues to rise at a +38% CAGR
through FY25 to $6bn.

Growth in Installed Base Underappreciated
Investors have been concerned relative to modest volume growth in iPhone in
the backdrop of plateauing smartphone volumes
iPhone volumes rose quickly from 11mnunits in the first year after the first iPhone
launch (FY08) to peak at 231mnunits in FY15, before moderating to FY17 volumes
of 217mn. The combination of Apple’s current three-fourths market share in the
premium smartphone market and expectations for flat volumes for the handset and
smartphone market have raised concerns relative to maturity of the smartphone
market and Apple’s position in it, leading to limited opportunities for volume
growth. We acknowledge the modest volume opportunity for iPhones, particularly
when every generationof smartphones is accompanied by price increases, and
forecast +1% volume CAGR through FY21E.

However, we believe investors are missing the forest for the trees: Installed base
demonstrating robust growth feeding into strong Services growth
While investors have been focused on iPhone volumes sold annually in the primary
market, the driver fueling the transformation to Services has been the expansion in
the installed base which has demonstrated double-digit growth to date. Going
forward, growth in the installed base is likely to moderate to a high-single-digit pace,
but still implying growth of roughly 100mnunits in the installed base of devices
every year relative to flat volumes in the primary market. The high-single-digit
expansion in the installed base is led by new consumers switching to the iOS
platform, new subscribers, and a high portion of replacement units makingtheir way
to the secondary market where we estimate iPhones have a 50% market share relative
to ~15%market share of the new smartphone market.

Limited Consumer Price Elasticity Will Continue to Surprise
Apple has continued to drive higher prices to grow revenues despite benign
growth in iPhone volumes; see acceleration in pricing over the forecast window
Blended ASPs for iPhones have increased at a +3% CAGR since 2007 with an even
higher increase in retail prices in certain geographies where carrier subsidies rolled
off after 2010. Despite the increase in prices, iPhone volumes have not shown any
significant signs of decline and investors have been pleasantly surprised by the
limited price elasticity exhibited by consumers. Banking on the limited price
elasticity demonstrated by consumers, Apple pivotedto a more aggressive pricing
strategy with the launch of the iPhone Xat a base price of $999 in 2017,which has
put the firm on track for a high-teen percentage increase in pricing for FY18E.The
latest generation of iPhones released on September 12 this year now has the top-end
product with a base price $1,099 and the low-end product with a base price of $749,
setting up the firm for another year of strong price increase, by our estimates.

Better track record of driving the premium pricing strategy relative to peers
Our analysis shows Apple has a better track record relative to competition with
driving consumer adoption of the top-end phone in its portfolio.For example,iPhone
X has accounted for one-third of total iPhone shipments to date and Apple’stop-end
iPhones accounted for 14%-38% of total shipments over the last sixquarters, which
compared to a range of 3%-24% for Samsung. Similarly, Apple has a solid track
record with larger screen size phones (marketed popularly as Plus Size models) with
shipments of these premium models accounting for an increasing portion of total
shipments, roughly in line with Samsung’s track record with a much broader set of
smartphone models offered in larger screen sizes.
Pricing strategy is sustainable as consumers are willing to pay more for
smartphones,which are dis-intermediating other IT hardware spend
We believe the pricing strategy is sustainable and expect limited price elasticity from
consumers led by: 1) stickiness of the iOS platform with the combination of the
iPhone and accessories,including watches; 2) smartphone capabilities increasing and
substituting demand for laptops and tablets, pushing out the replacement cycle led
consumer spending on these devices; 3) consumers spending an increasing amount of
time on a smartphone; and 4) consumers increasingly using financing to convert the
high retail prices into affordable monthly payments.

Pricing strategy to drive change incomposition of iPhone revenue growth, with
surprises led by pricing strength
We forecast solid growth in iPhone revenue from iPhone sales, despite heightened
investor concerns around both volumes and pricing. We expect growth in revenues
from iPhone sales to moderate from +12% CAGR over the last fiveyears to a +9%
CAGR for FY17-FY21E, but still surprise on the upside relative to investor
expectationsled by a greater contribution from price increases.

Capital Deployment Provides Option Value to Investors
Target of neutral net cash position long-term provides optionality to investors
Apple ended F3Q18 with $244bnof cash on the balance sheet and with debt of
$115bn, leading to a net cash position of $129bn. Additionally, the firm has
generated on average free cash flow of $54bnover the last fiveyears. Apple has not
put a timeline to its net cash neutral target, but the availability ofupto $291bnor
~30% of the market cap to deploy over FY19E-21E through a combination of
dividends, share repurchases, and M&A provides enormous option value to investors
in terms of upside to earnings.
Embed increasedshare repurchases and dividend in our base case forecasts,
partly drivingour above consensus forecast for FY20 and FY21
Apple has returned roughly $300bnof cash to shareholders since 2012 through the
end of F3Q18,which is roughly 30% of its current market capital, and we expect
there is another roughly $300bnto deploy over the next threeyears. While we don’t
expect Apple to reach its net cash neutral position by end of FY21E, we expect share
buybacks to accelerate to a $75bnannual pace (similar to 2018E) rather than the
slower pace of around $30-$35bnduring FY15-17—in part driving our above
consensus forecast for FY20E and FY21E. Additionally, we are modeling a steady
increase in dividends from $2.40/share in FY17 to $3.42/share in FY21E, amounting
to $42bnof dividends over the next three years.

Acceleration in share repurchases to drive 6% accretion to our already above
consensus FY20 and FY21 earnings estimates
Despite our above consensus modeled pace of buybacks in FY20 and FY21, we still
expect Apple to have a net cash position of $60bnby end of FY21E (and generating
over $64bnof free cash annually). We see upside to our already above consensus
forecasts if management decides to aggressively pursue their target foraneutral cash
position. We estimate a pace of buybacks close to $100bnannually would drive the
company to a cashneutral position by end of FY21E, and imply upside of $2.25 to
our already above consensus FY21E EPS forecast.
Balance between share purchase acceleration and M&A is likely as Apple
invests to build the Services platform and maintain leadership in technology
We believe it is more realistic to assume a balance between an acceleration of share
repurchases beyond what is already in our base case estimates and spend on
acquisitions as the drivers of earnings upside relative to our estimates.
M&A Opportunities: Focus on Services with Large Installed
Base
Apple has historically only engaged in bolt-on acquisitions;expect focus to be on
subscription-based service opportunities in the coming years
Apple has a history of making multiple bolt-on acquisitions everyyear, whichhas
largelybeen focused on bringing any hardware technologythatthe company expects
to be crucial in driving competitive differentiationin-house and better managingits
development towards commercialization. As shown in Table 1, a lot of applications
in use on iPhones today can be associated with technology acquisitions in the past,
for example,facial recognition using 3D sensing and speech recognition for Siri.
However, as we look at the transformation of the business to Services at a rapid pace,
we expect a greater bias towards acquiring subscription-based software businesses
that can be integrated into the Services segment, and we believe the recent
acquisitions of Shazam and Texture are typical examples of what investors should
expect going forward.

Relative to transformational M&A driving access to new end-markets, we
expect criteria to include large installed base and services opportunity
We believe with increasing focus on Services revenues, particularly in the form of
subscriptions, Apple’s interest in entering new end-markets is likely to be evaluated
based on the opportunity for Apple to offer services (leveraging the iOS platform) on
a large installed base. Certain end-markets in our view couldbe of interest based on
this criterion:
1. Video gaming companies: The video gaming industry generates about $125bnin
revenues, including roughly one-third on smartphones, making it an attractive
industry for smartphone manufacturers in terms of vertical integration,
particularly given recent investments in augmented reality.Apple’s focus on
services will be highly complemented by video games, which are taking time and
monetization share from other forms of entertainment. JPM Media analyst,
Alexia Quadrani, believes the increasing global reach, improving technology,
shift to higher-margin digital revenues, and increasingly social environments are
fueling greater player engagement and spending. Software game sales are
becoming increasingly digital (in the US 31% of total sales in 2010 to 74% in
2016) which is likely to coincide with the increasing computing capabilities and
larger screen sizes on smartphones to drive consumer gaming habits increasingly
to mobile devices. We see opportunity for smartphone-basedgaming to increase
from current levels of one-third of gaming revenues to around 40% of the
industry by 2020, led by a double-digit annual growth rate.
2. Automotive services: Numerous press reports have in the past indicated Apple’s
interest in the automotive end-market, including developing an autonomous
vehicle. We think Apple’s interest in the automotive end-market is reasonable
given the large installed base (roughly 1.4bnvehicles globally) and the ability to
deliver services to drivers and passengers. We see the automotive OEM business


Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018

as a largely unattractive one both in terms of manufacturing and supply chain
complexity, and profitability. Though,we would not rule out acquisitions of:
a. Infotainment companiesproviding Apple ability to deliver content in the
automotive end-market. Apple has already developed the CarPlay software to
get access to the automotive end-market, but we believe owning the complete
infotainment product would allow Apple to deliver the same high-quality
experience that it hasbeen able to offer consumers on other devices like the
iPhone.
b. Small-scale automotive OEMsto provide Apple experience in integration of
software-based services with the hardware.
3. Smart Speakers: We acknowledge that Apple already has a HomePod product,
which was first released in early 2018. Based on our discussion with the
company, we believe Apple wants to position the HomePod as a high-quality
speaker with some intelligence features, relative to: 1) Google Assistant, which is
geared to intelligence leveraging the company’s leadership in search functions;
and 2) Amazon Alexa, which is geared towards promoting Amazon’s portfolio of
features, including driving purchases in the Amazon marketplace. We believe this
leaves room for Apple to position another product with greater intelligence
features and with a different form factor, potentially leveraging an acquisition
similar to its purchase of Beats to enter the headphone category.

Apple’s Opportunity in Health & Fitness
Apple has already disrupted the fitness-wearables market
Apple’s launch of AppleWatch was relatively late when compared to early movers
in the fitness-driven wearables market,including Garmin, Fitbit and Nike. However,
despite being late to the market, Apple Watch managed to disrupt some of the
existing players, particularly single-activity tracking devices, as wellasexpand the
addressable market for the wearables market. While most early entrants into the
wearables market were seen as functional products targeting the fitness enthusiast,
we believe Apple managed to expand the addressable market with a utility product,
which went beyond the niche segment of fitness enthusiasts.
Now set to addresshealth-wearablesmarket, further expanding the target
demographic to drive higherpenetration
We believe with the launch of features like heart rate monitoring and electro cardio
grams (ECGs) inthe latest generation of Apple Watches (Series 4), Apple is now
making a bigger push into health-based wearables, expanding the target market
beyond the typical age demographic interested in fitness wearables. For example,the
target age demographicin the USnow includes an additional 136mnpeople in the
age group of 50 years and above, relative to the existing target market of 182mnin
the age group below 50 years for fitness-based wearables.
Move into preventive healthcare to provideawider TAM than diagnostics
We believe the preventive healthcare market is an even more attractive market than
diagnostics.With its entry into health-based wearables Apple is able to target a much
wider population relative to the targeted individuals in the diagnostic phase following
symptom identification. For example, relative to the occurrence of AFib (Atrial
Fibrilation),which the Series 4 watch can help identify, the number of people
impacted in the US rangesfrom 2.7mnto 6.1mnand the company will be involved in
the diagnostic phase with products from specialized companies like iRythm (covered
by JPM Medical Supplies & Devices analyst Robbie Marcus).This compares to
182mnTAM for those aged50 or more who are likely to adopt the Apple Watch for
preventive measures and symptom identification for AFib.
Multiple Re-rating from Services Transformation and
Visibility into Replacement Demand
Revenue acceleration likely to be a catalyst to increase investor focuson
Services transformation
We believe investors have largely ignored the transformation of the business towards
Services. However, looking forward, we see a catalyst in the acceleration in revenue
growth to a forecasted +10% CAGR from the +8% CAGR in the last five years, with
further likely upside to our estimates from: 1) stronger increase in Services revenue
per device; 2) stronger than expected pricing on iPhones; 3) and stronger than
currently modeled growth in the Apple Watch after a major refresh with the Series 4.
Boosted by an aggressive capital deployment program with repurchases totaling a
forecasted $294bnfor FY18E-FY21E, we expect a +17% earnings CAGR leading to
our above consensus EPS forecasts.

Apple shares have traded at a discount to the S&P 500 multiple, despite
stronger revenue and earnings growth
We find it largely unwarranted that AAPL shares have traded at a modest discount to
the average S&P 500 multiple over the last few years despite a stronger historical
track record in revenue and earnings growth, as well as stronger outlook. As shown
in Figure 14, Apple shares still trade only roughly in line to at a modest discount to
the S&P 500, despite a stronger revenue outlook and earnings growth outlook
relative to the average company in the S&P 500.

Premium to recent year average multiple warranted on return to innovation
We believe the recent year discount on Apple’s trading multiple relative to the S&P
500 multiple has largely been driven by the perception that opportunities for
innovative product launches into new markets have moderated since the large
success of the iPhone. However, we believe Apple has now returned to
demonstrating its innovation prowess, although now disrupting end-markets like
wearables, health, and gaming, rather than disrupting existing hardware like it did
with iPhones. In our view, the return to innovation warrants a re-rating relative to
recent year average P/E multiple of 13.5x.
We believe a modest re-rating is warranted based on our SOTP analysis
Wearrive at a blended multiple of 17.8x for the combination of Apple’s products and
services we anticipate in our forecast and expect a modest re-rating from current
NTM trading multiple of 16.6x, led by a 14.0x multiple on the iPhone (in line with
Nokia’s multiple during its leadership in feature phones)and 26.0x on Services (in
line with hardline and luxury goods retailers with similar loyalty-driven recurring
purchases from customers).

Should AAPL shares be valued in line with consumer staples?
It appears there has been an increasing narrative that AAPL should be evaluated in
comparison to earnings multiples for consumer staples companies, such as
Household and PersonalCare products with high degree of repeat purchases by
consumers. We acknowledge the repeat purchase cycle for consumers in relation to
the iPhone and Services group, which together currently account for 77% of total
company revenues; however,the iPad, Mac, and Other products have more
unpredictable replacement cycles. In addition, while the average 21x P/E multiple for
Household and Personal Care (HPC) companies can be thought of as the high-end of
potential re-ratingfor AAPL shares, we think investors should consider a discount to
the average HPC multiple to account for the ability of consumers to push out
smartphone purchases during a downturn in addition to trading down to less
expensive variants, with only the latter likely for HPC products.

Favorable Position Relative to Other Technology Leaders

positioned relative to balance of valuation multiple against earnings outlook
Interestingly, with annual revenues of $230bn, Apple is ahead of other technology
leaders, including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Netflix (all covered by JPM
Internet analyst Doug Anmuth). In greater contrast, Apple’s $61bnin operating profit
compares to $26bnfor Alphabet, $20bnfor Facebook, $4bnforAmazon, and $0.8bn
for Netflix, showcasing a much stronger track record of generating profits than other
technology leaders.While revenue and earnings growth rates for AAPL are expected
to be a little less than half of the group average of Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and
Netflix, so is the earnings multiple of 16.0x relative to the group average of 42.2x.
As a result,we find AAPL shares screening well forboth growth and value investors
relative to techleaders when looking at earnings multiple for every point of earnings
growth, with PEG ratio (ex-cash) of 0.8x relative to the group average of 1.0x.

Tariff Headwinds Could Moderate Earnings Growth
Expectations
Currently proposed tariffsonly impact accessories
Apple recently sent a letter to the US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer,
detailing a list of products that will be impacted from the currently proposed $200bn
of tariffs on imports from China. The list initially included products from the “Other
Products” segment, which has total revenues of an estimated $26bn in FY19E, but
was later updated to exclude Apple Watch which we estimate accountsfor almost
half of the segment revenues. We estimate Other Products excluding Apple Watch
has gross margins closer to 20%. iPhones are also currently outside the purview of
the proposed tariffs.
We see limited impact as Apple is likely to take pricing to offset the pressures
We believe it is relatively easier for Apple to raise prices on accessories relative to
taking price increases on the iPhone. We expect relatively minimal price elasticity
for accessory products and expect Apple to likely raise prices to cover entirely the
tariffs. As shown in Table 7below, we expect the 25% tariff to translate into a price
increase of 15% if Apple decides to pass the entire impact of the tariff to consumers.

Headwind of up to 50bps in the worst case if Apple decides not to raise prices
As shown in Scenario 3in the table above, we estimate a headwind of up to 50 bps to
total company margins if Apple decides to take a conservative approach to prices and
absorb the impact, which in our view is unlikely given the even lower degree of price
elasticity on accessories.
No tariff impact on iPhone currently; however, we would not expect a change in
sourcing strategy even with a 25% tariff
Although the iPhone is not the purview of currently proposed tariffs, the greater risk
to Apple would be from any potential developments relative to tariffs on the iPhone,
which accounts for 60% of total company revenues. However, our analysis shows
that even if a 25% tariff were to be imposed, it would still make economic sense for
Apple to continue with the current manufacturing footprint relative to moving the
assembly to the United States. Over the long-run, we would expect Apple to move
assembly operations for the iPhone (done by Pegatron, Honhai, and Wistron) to other
countries with relatively cheaper labor cost relative to the United States and not

(1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018

under the purview of punitive import tariffs from the administration, for example,
Mexico.
See labor cost still driving enough arbitrage to keep existing manufacturing
footprint rather than move to the United States
As shown inTable 8, we estimate moving the assembly operations to the United
States for the iPhone X would increase the cost to Apple from ~$522 to ~$643
(assuming only 50% of components are manufactured in China), relative to an
estimated cost of $653 if Apple decided to pay a 25% tariff on the assembled
product. In our view, the lack of any major advantage of moving assembly operations
back to the United States limits the likelihood of any investment in the US as a
consequence of the tariffs.

Price increase of 13% required to absorb impact of tariff
As shown in Table 9, we estimate a price increase of around 13% would be required
to absorb the impact of a 25% tariff, keeping margin dollars for all players in the
supply chain constant.

Worst case headwinds of 300 bps to gross margins if Apple does not price for
the tariff
However, if Apple were to be willing to absorb all the tariff and not raise prices, we
estimate a 300 bps headwind to margins.

Prices increases to cover part of the tariff impact more likely; 10% retail price
increase would mitigate gross margin headwind to less than 100 bps
As shown in Table 11, if Apple were to take a 10% price increase on the iPhone
citing punitive tariffs, it would reduce the estimated headwind from any potential
tariffs to less than 100 bps on gross margin.

Financial Outlook
Revenue Outlook: Low-Double-Digit Growth Led by iPhone,
and Services
Innovation has enabled the company to drive a +8% revenue CAGR over the
last five years
Apple’s innovation in new and existing product categories, including smartphones,
tablets, and watches has helped drive robust revenue growth for the firm over the last
few years. Looking over the last five years, the firm has posted revenue CAGR of
+8% between FY12 and FY17, although as shown in Figure 15, FY17 revenues are
largely in line with FY15 revenues following a levelling out of the growth driver in
the form of iPhone revenues. As shown in Figure 16, relative to the revenue growth
of $73bnfrom FY12to FY17 for the firm, three-fourths has been driven by iPhones,
and 20% by Services, with Mac and Other Products contributing a minority, while
iPad has been a modest headwind.

We expect low-double-digit revenue growth, led by iPhone, Services, and Apple
Watch
As shown in Table 13, we believe the medium-term revenue growth for the company
will track in the low-double-digit range, led by a combination of: 1) high-single-digit
revenue growth in iPhones, largely driven through price/ASP increases; 2) double-
digit revenue growth in Services, led by growth in both the installed base as well as
revenueper unit from the installed base; and 3) double-digit revenue growth in Other
Products, the combination of which is likely to be partly offset bydeclinesin iPads
andMac devices.

Despite similar growth expectations relative to history, the composition of
growth is likely to be materially different
Relative to the $73bnof revenue growth over the five-year period starting in FY12,
we expect even greater revenue growth of $111bnover our four-year forecast
window (FY17-FY21E). However, as shown in the comparison in Figure 17and
Figure 18, while iPhone sales accounted for three-fourths of the revenue growth in
the last fiveyears, we expect the growth in the next fouryears to be more balanced,
although iPhones will continueto be the leading contributor to growth. As shown in
Figure 18, we expect growth drivers to shift to Services and Other Products
(accessories) in addition to the growth in iPhone revenues.

Despite continued volume concerns from investors, we expect revenue growth,
although now led by pricing
As shown in Figure 19, we forecast growth in revenue from iPhone sales, despite
heightened investor concerns around both volumes and pricing. However, we do
expect growth in revenues from iPhone sales to moderate from +12% CAGR over
the last fiveyears to +9% CAGR for FY17-FY21E.

However, mix of volume and ASP drivers for revenue growth to change relative
to historical trends
While we do expect continued revenue growth from iPhone sales, we expect the
composition of growth drivers to be more heavily weighted to pricing relative to
volumes. As shown in the comparison in Figure 20and Figure 21, we expect the
drivers of revenue growth to shift from being weighted to volume growth in the last
five years to being weighted to ASP growth over the next fouryears.

Services to be second largest revenue growth driver and to more than double
FY16 revenues by FY20E
We expect Services to turn out to be the second largest revenue growth driver for the
company over the medium-term and expect it to comfortably meet the firm’s target
of $48bnin revenues by FY20. As shown in Figure 22, we expect Services revenue
growth to accelerate and rise at a +23% CAGR over our forecast window. Helped by
the strong pace of growth, by our estimates, Services revenue should reach $56bnby
FY20E, relative to Apple’s target of $48bn. The forecast growth in Services revenue
is led by both growth in the installed base and rise in Services revenue per device in
the installed base.

As shown in Figure 23, we expect the installed base of all devices, estimatedto be around 1.4bndevices at FY18E end, will continue to increase ata high-single-digit pace to 1.9bndevices by FY21E. However, we believe primary portion ofServices revenues will be levered to the installed base of iPhone devices withcustomers being able to use the same subscription across all their devices. As shownin Figure 23, we estimate the installed base of iPhones (including those with secondowners) will be roughly 1bndevices at the end of FY18E, progressing to 1.45bnatFY21E end, implying high-single-digitincreases. Net, we expect the high-single-digit pace of increase in the installed base to outpace the modest declinefor legacydevices, including iPhones, iPads, and Mac devices, positioning the Services groupfor stronger growth relative to new devices.Figure 23: Growth in Installed Base Figure 24: New (Legacy) Device SalesUnits in Millions Units in Millions2,000 iPhone Installed Base Total Installed Base 1,856 300 280 279 274 277 2781,7381,8001,6211,531 2501,600 1,420 1,4451,400 1,304 1,252 1,348 2001,162 1,1681,200 1,0471,000 923 150798800 10060050400200 -0 FY17 FY18E FY19E FY20E FY21EFY15 FY16 FY17 FY18E FY19E FY20E FY21E iPhone iPad MacSource: Company reports and J.P.

Also expect growth in revenue per installed base device, led by growth in Music,
App Store, Apple Care, and Apple Pay penetration
As shown inFigure 25, we expect a continuedstrong pace of increase in Services
revenue per device in the installed base, from a variety of growth drivers including
increasing penetration of Apple Music within the installed base, increase in adoption
as well as revenue per transaction for Apple Pay, continued growth in App Store
revenues from increasing pace of application activity by third-party developers, and
penetration of Apple Care as the preferred support and repair coverage for new
device sales relative to third-party coverage.

Other Products, including Apple Watch, to be third primary driver of medium-
term revenue growth
The Other Products segment comprises various products, primary among which is
the Apple Watch. Additionally, Apple has seen good success with launch of
accessory products like Airpods and with the acquisition of Beats. While we expect
growth in revenues ofthe Other Products segment to be driven by multiple products,
we believe the primary driver will be sales of Apple Watch, which is already the
leading smart watch globally.

Margin Outlook: Investment in Services to Be Modest
Headwind
Gross margins have moderated on a combination of headwinds including
memory costs and currency
While Apple’sgross margins have improved substantially from the 29.0% in FY06,
prior to the launch of the iPhone, they have been range bound around the 38%-40%
level for the last three years. Additionally, as shown in Figure 27, gross margins in
recent years are lower than the peak gross margin of 43.9% in FY12, led we believe
by a combination of the following: 1) increase in memory costs; 2) currency
headwinds; 3) increasing exposure to accessory sales at lower margins, partly offset
by growth in Services revenue.

Expect gross margins to be range boundon increasing mix of Services revenue

Table 14below shows our forecast for gross margin by product. We estimate iPhone
sales, and Services to be accretive to corporate gross margins, while sales of iPad,
Mac devices, and Other Products excluding the Apple Watch are dilutive to gross
margins. Apple does not disclose margin by product.

Figure 28shows our gross margin forecasts, which we expect to remain largely range

Services revenues, which we estimateto be at higher-than-corporate margins and
increasing mix for revenues from sales of accessory products (excluding Apple
Watch), which we estimate to be at lower margins relative to corporate margins.

Despite stable gross margins, we forecast moderation in operating margins with
the company likely to prioritize growth in Services opportunities
We expect to see a higher pace of investments from Apple towards driving the
existing services revenue opportunities and create new opportunities. While there is
ample headroom for growth in current Services opportunities, including growth in
penetration of Apple Music and Apple Pay, we believe more investments are likely
to drive original content in both Apple Musicand video content.

Earnings Outlook: Strong Double-Digit CAGR Driven by
Combination of Revenue Growth and Share Repurchases
Earnings growth to accelerate led by capital deployment
While we expect modest acceleration in revenue growth relative to the pace over the
last fiveyears, we expect a stronger earnings acceleration led by an accelerated pace
of share repurchases. As shown in Figure 30, we expect the pace of earnings growth
to accelerate to a +17% CAGR for FY17-FY21E, relative to +8% earnings CAGR

Largest capital return program for any US company, pace of repurchases
accelerated since tax reform
After already returning $275bnof capital to shareholders through repurchases and
dividends since 2012, Apple announced a $100bnbuyback program in May of 2018.
In addition to the$100bnbuyback program, Apple has an existing dividend through
which Apple has already promised to return around $14bnannually, the combination
of which makes it the largest capital return program for any US company. The pace
of repurchases accelerated earlier this year on the back favorable tax reform. We
expect Apple to buyback$74bnof stock in FY18E and $70bnof FY19E, to exhaust
the $100bnprogram announced in mid-FY18, before accelerating to a pace of around
$75bnannually. This compares to repurchases of $165bnbetween FY13 and FY17
(fiveyears), at an average pace of $33bn/year.

Large repurchases are enabled by attractive free cash flow
Apple’s large repurchase activity is facilitated by attractive free cash flow generation,
which we currentlyforecast to be in the range of $65bn-$69bnannually in the
coming years. As shown in Figure 32, despite a very large repurchase and dividend
program, Apple has continued to add cash to the balance sheet helped by free cash
flow exceeding the capital returns in most years. Additionally, Apple has largely

refrained from any large acquisitions, with the only notable large acquisition in the

Valuation
Our SOTP-Based Analysis Suggests +23% Upside to Our
December 2019 Price Target
We rate Apple shares Overweight with a December 2019 price target of $272,
implying +23% upside from current levels.
We rate Apple shares Overweight
We rate shares of Apple Overweight given our favorable outlook for continued
growth in iPhone revenues led by price, combined with significant growth
opportunities for its Services segment which is levered to growth in the installed base
as well opportunity to increase Services revenue per device in the installed base.
We value Apple shares using a blended multiple, which values Apple’s various
product segments at different multiples
We believe a blended multiple is most appropriate for Apple, which as discussed is
expected to see a shift in the composition of growth drivers from hardware sales to
services sales. While growth in Services revenues isexpected to be one of the
primary drivers of the revenue growth for the company through FY21, it still only
accountsfor 20% of total company revenues by the end of our forecast window
(FY21). We expect the growth in Services revenue to drive accelerationin revenue
growth for the total company beyond our forecast window, as it becomes a greater
portion of total company revenues.
Our SOTP approach implies a blended 17.5x P/E multiple is appropriate
We estimate earnings per share contributions from the various product segments and
arrive at our price target by assigning P/E multiple appropriate for the earnings
growth outlook for each segment. Key assumptions used in formulating the price
target as shown in Table 16are:
 iPhone:We use a 14.0x P/E multiple for our iPhone earnings estimate in
calendar 2020, in line with the multiple that industry leader in the early 2000s,
Nokia, traded at from 2005to 2010 when the firm had a leadership position in
feature phones.

 Mac devices:P/E multiple of 11.0x,modest discount to the 12.2x NTM P/E
multiple for competitor HPQ, largely subject to similar industry dynamics, but
lower unit growth on account of premium pricing.
 iPad devices: P/E multiple of 11.0x, in line with the multiple we assign for Mac
devices as growth opportunities are limited for both notebooks as well as tablets.
Additionally, we believe increasing consumption of content on smartphones is
likely to substitute purchases of laptops/notebooks as well as tablets in the future.
 Services: P/E multiple of 26.0x on the Services segment, in line with the average
trading multiple for a peer group of luxury/retail companies (Costco, Estée
Lauder and Home Depot), which are leaders in their respective markets and
derive a stickiness for product sales through customer loyalty either in the form
of membership programs or brand value. We believe the subscription nature of
Apple’sServices segment, with high visibility of revenue and earnings, warrants
it beingvalued in line with the leading luxury/retail companies. As shown in
Table 15, the average NTM for the peer group is 26.6x.

Source: Bloomberg.Note: Consensus estimates.
 Apple Watch:P/E multiple of 25.0x, roughly in line with the 26.0x target
multiple we use for the Services group, on account of the materially higher room
for growth relative to Apple’s legacy hardware products like iPhone, iPad, and
Mac.
 Other Products:P/E multipleof 16.0x, at a modest premium to the legacy
hardware devices like iPhone, iPad, and Mac on account of higher growth
opportunities. However, the 16.0x multiple is at a discount to the 25.0x multiple
we use to value Apple Watch on account of lower margins for accessory sales in
a more competitive market.

iPhone: Premium Strategy May Limit Volume Opportunity,
But Not Revenues
Mature penetration of mobile handsets globally makes it one of the most
attractive markets
The increasing adoption of mobile handsets globally, including both smartphones
and feature phones, has driven the market to 2.0bnunits in 2017 from 1.1bnin 2007,
representing a +6% CAGR over the last ten-year period. The significant increase
means that roughly every fourth individual globally buys a mobile handset each year.
Additionally, the installed base globally for mobile handsets is estimated to be
roughly 7.4bn, which means that almost every individual globally owns one. The
high penetrationandvolume opportunity makesit a very attractive market for new
entrants.

Thedisruption ofthe feature phone market by smartphones
While the global handset industry demonstrated a strong CAGR of +6% over the last
tenyears, within the industry we saw significant disruption led by smartphones
marginalizing feature phones to the low-end of the market. As shown in Figure 45,
roughly 512mnfeature phones are sold annually relative to 1.5bnsmartphones
currently, making smartphones the primary segment within the mobile handset
industry. This is relative to ~90% of the total mobile handset industry comprising
feature phones in 2007.

Samsung and Apple disrupted the mobile handset industry as new entrants
Apple was one of the disrupters in the mobile handset industry with the launch of its
smartphone, the iPhone, in 2007. Despite being a premium offering priced at $499,
relative to the majority of feature phones available in the market at that time, the
iPhone managed to gain share quickly. Other manufacturers, including Samsung, had
already been dabbling with the idea of smartphones by then, starting with the
Samsung SPH-I300 launched in 2001. However, the market for smartphones
received a boost from the launch of the iPhone by Apple and subsequent launches by
Samsung, including the Samsung Galaxy in 2009. Nokia, the large incumbent player
globally in feature phones, did not focus on keeping up with the changing consumer
preference towards smartphones and quickly lost out on its strong position in the
market. As shown in Figure 46, Nokia had 49% global market share in 2007 with
Apple and Samsung accounting foronly 3% and 2% market share, respectively.
Since then, the market has changed dramatically with only two of the top eight
companies from 2007 still remaining today. As shown in Figure 47, Samsung and
Apple were ranked #1 and #2 in 2017, respectively. At the same time, it is worth
noting that the Smartphone market has become more fragmented, with the top three
companies now accounting foronly 48% of total shipments, which compares to 65%
in 2007.

Emerging countriesaccount for the majority of smartphone shipments
With smartphones largely accessible to most demographics today,given the wide
range of price points at which they are offered to consumers, population has a strong
correlation to thesize of the smartphonemarketin any particular country. As shown
in Figure 48, China accountedfor 30% of the smartphone shipments in 2017,
followed by the US (12%)and India (8%). Additionally, as shown in Figure 49,
Emerging countries accountedfor 76% of smartphoneshipments in 2017, while
Developed countries accountedfor 24%.

Emerging countries account for an even greater portion of the installed base
As illustrated in Figure 50, despite consumers in Developed countries being early
adopters of smartphones, Developed countries only accounted for 20% of the
smartphone installed base in 2017, which compares to 24% of smartphone revenues.
We believe the higher churn rate and the shorter life-cycle of smartphones for
consumers in Developed countries compared to consumers in Emerging countries
drives the higher revenue contribution relative to the size of the installed base. See
Figure 51for a more granular breakdown of the global installed base by region.

Smartphones to continue displacingfeature phones and increase penetration
Whilethe penetration of mobile handsets is high on aglobal level,we continue to see
further growth opportunities for smartphones driven by thedisplacementof feature
phones, particularly in underserved Emergingcountries dominated by feature
phones.As shown in Figure 53, smartphone penetration standsat 60 per 100 people,
which compares to almost complete mobile handset penetrationglobally.

Significant growth opportunity from increasing smartphone penetration
We expect smartphone penetration to increase relative to feature phones over time.
As illustrated in Figure 55, an increase in smartphone penetration to the levels
displayed by the United States and Germany would imply a significant volume
opportunityof more than 1bnunits for theremaining countries.

Developed countriesremain attractive onhigher smartphone churn rates
With a high penetration of smartphonesin Developed countries, the growth in the
installed base is likely to be closely tied to populationgrowth, in contrast to
Emerging countrieswhere the smartphone installed base is likely outstrip population
growth. However, as shown in Figure 56, population growth in Developed countries
is expectedto be modestly positive, driving our expectations for modest growth for
the smartphone market in Developed countries.

Growth opportunity in Emerging countriesis greater than in Developed
countries, but more likely in the low-tier price segments
The growth drivers for the smartphone industry are greater in Emerging countries
relative to the Developed countries, and thus we expect stronger growth over the
medium-term in the Emerging countries. However, with an increasing portion of the
growth coming from Emerging countries, the OEMs with products positioned atthe
low-tier and at the low end of the mid-tier smartphone marketare more likely to
benefit relative to the OEMs with products focused on the premium smartphone
market, which includes Apple.

iPhone: Premium Pricing and Mix Strategy Key to Growth
Driving revenue growththrough average selling price increases
While Apple’s limited market share in Emerging countries is an opportunity, we
have not seen any appreciable change in strategy, which would allow it to better
leverage the forecasted growth for smartphone shipments in Emerging countries.
However, Apple has successfully explored a premium pricing strategy to drive
revenue growth through consistent increases in prices. As shown in Figure 65, the
average selling price of an iPhone has increased +36% since 2007, or +3% per
annum, which has recently supported revenue growth as unit shipments have started
to plateau.

Consumers experience even greater priceincreases onroll-off of subsidies
As illustratedin Figure 66, the price to consumersfor iPhonesin certain countries
has increased at an even greater pace relative to the +3% CAGR reported by Apple.
Specifically, following the initial launch of the iPhone, telecom service carriers sold
iPhoneswith a heavy subsidy to make itmore palatablefor consumersin an effort to
grow their respectivesubscriber bases. Carrier subsidies, which were quite prevalent
historically in the US, limited the price paid by iPhone consumersfrom 2008 to
2013. Followingthat period,carriers moved away from subsidies and instead began
offering consumers monthly installment programs to drive device ownershipand
replacement.

Apple’s premium smartphone customers demonstrate low price elasticity
As shown in Figure 67and Figure 68, iPhone shipments continued to increase
despite the roll-off of carrier subsidies starting in 2013. Whileinvestors are
concerned about the price elasticity of consumers given Apple’s pricing strategy, the
increase in iPhone shipments long-term indicates to us that investor concerns appear
unfounded and the customer demographic targeted by Apple demonstrates very low
price elasticity.

Success of pricingstrategy demonstrated withadoption of premium smartphone
The steady increase in pricing for iPhones hasbeen led by the success of Apple’s
launch of premium smartphones despite concerns aroundprice elasticity. While there
is seasonality relative to demand, Figure 69demonstrates that Apple’stop-end
smartphonein any particular period hasbeen successful in capturing a significant
portion of consumersin each quarterfollowing its initial release, which has resulted
in the increase in Apple’sblended average selling price. Despite investor concerns
relative to demand for premium smartphones, consumers have not shied away from
purchasingApple’stop-end smartphone.

Demand for the latest generation smartphone remains very high
Despite Apple increasing the price for every generation of iPhone, consumers have
shown a strong preference for the latest generationof phones, which largely reflects
preference for incremental features that Apple introduces with each new model. As
illustrated in Figure 70, the latest generation of iPhone, which is usually introduced
in September of each year, has become the primary contributor to unit shipments for
the next four quarters, despite the availability of the previousgeneration for a
reduced price. In our view, this demonstrates the premium pricing Apple is able to
drive through consumer preference for features introduced on the latest generation of
the iPhone.

Success of “Plus” models also contributing to success in pricing strategy
Until 2017, the “Plus” models were the top-end smartphone in Apple’s portfolio. As
shown in Figure 71, “Plus” models increased as a mix of iPhone shipments as Apple
successfully drove a significant proportion of customers to upgrade to the larger
screen size for a premium price. Despite the launch of the iPhone Xas Apple’s top-
end smartphone in 4Q17, it only modestly cannibalized the mix of the “Plus” models,
which are still sold at a premium to the corresponding base model with a 4.7 inch
screen. For example, the “Plus” and the Xmodel, both at a premium to the base
iPhone model with a 4.7 inch display, accounted for 48% of the mix in 2Q18 (26%
iPhone Plus + 22% iPhone X), which compares to the “Plus” model accounting for
38% of mix in 1Q17.

Expanding the portfolio with more product offerings in recent generations
Starting with the launch of the iPhone in 2007, Apple focused its energy on
delivering one quality product every year, following up on the first iPhone launch in
2007 with the launch of iPhone 3G in 2008, iPhone 3GS in 2009, iPhone 4 in 2010,
iPhone 4S in 2011, and iPhone 5 in 2012. Starting in 2013, Apple moved to a two-
product strategy with the launch of the 5C and 5S, followed by the launch of the 6
and 6 Plus in 2014, and 6S and 6S Plus in 2015. Apple has now moved to a three-
product strategy with the launch of the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and the iPhone SE in
2016, followed by the launch of the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X in 2017,
and the launch of iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR in 2018.

Expanding the portfolio, widening the price points
By expanding the iPhone model lineup with every generation from one in 2007-12 to
three in 2016, Apple is able to offer consumers a wider range of choices in terms of
device capabilities, screen dimensions, as well as price points. For example, in the
latest generation of iPhones launched in 2018, the price range between the low-end
iPhone XRand the high-end iPhoneXS Maxis $350 (starting prices), relative to
$100 in 2014 and 2015 when Apple launched two products in each generation.
Apple to deliverthe best consumer experience on a small number of models
Despite Apple modestly broadening its portfolio over time,we believe itwill
continue to focus on delivering a solid consumer experience through a small number
of models, rather than pursue a broad portfolio similar to competition. As shown in
Figure 73,Apple sells the fewestdifferent phone models relative to its primary
competitors in any given quarter. We believe the focus on a smallernumber of
models allows Apple to drive higher volume leverage across its portfolio as well as
focus marketing spend on fewer products, driving the optimum outcome in relation
to both gross margin and operating margins.

Fewer models and premium pricing drive best-in-class productmargins
We believe the combination of the premium pricing strategy as well as the focus of
both R&D and marketing spend acrossfewer modelscontributes to Apple’s stronger
margins on iPhones relative to competitors. As shown in Figure 74, Apple delivers
stronger margins than any of its competitors in the smartphone industry. Admittedly,
some of the companies mentioned below have business interests outside of
smartphones, but we estimate Apple has a leadership in margins forsmartphones on
a stand-alone basis relative to any competitive products. The higher operating
margins are a function of: 1) higher gross margin led byafocus on premium
smartphones; 2) pricing power with the customer demographic purchasing premium
smartphones; and 3) lower operating costs, which is a function offocusing on
developing 2-3 stand-out smartphone models during a year,allowing for better
leverage of costs over greater volumes per phone model.

As shown in Figure 75, despite increasing the price of the top-end iPhone offered
from 2016 to 2017 by around $200 (+25% y/y), demand was much stronger than
most investors would have expected. Specifically, iPhoneX accounted for 30% of
the mix of total iPhone shipments to date, which demonstrates that Apple’s strategy
of launching top-end smartphones with a competitively superior feature set has been
successful.

Success of top-end strategy stands out relative to primary competitor Samsung
Apple’s strategy tofocus on the top-end smartphone stands out relative to its primary
competitor, Samsung. Samsung has a broader portfolio of devices with a wider range
of price points, including some smartphones that are comparable in price to Apple’s
top-end phones in certain generations. While we acknowledge the difference in
strategies between Apple and Samsung may make a comparison difficult, we think it
is important to highlight that as shown in Figure 77, Samsung’s top-end smartphone
has only reached ~20% of total shipments.

Samsung’s top-end smartphoneshave contributed a lower portion of revenues
While it might not be the most appropriate to compare Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Plus
and Galaxy S9 Plus to Apple’s iPhone X, given different portfolio strategies, we
believe the comparison can provide insights into the ability to drive towards a very
rich mix and maximize margins. As shown in Figure 79, Samsung’s top-end

Success for Apple and Samsung has been fairly similar with “Plus” sized models
Larger screen sizes have been a driver of higher ASPs as well for smartphone
manufacturers, with both Apple and Samsung choosing to label the larger screen size
models as “Plus” and charging roughly $0-$100 premium relative to the base model.
When we focus on shipments of smartphones with screen sizes larger than 5.5 inches
for both Apple and Samsung, we find that both have had similar success in driving
an increasing mix of shipments from larger screen sizes at a premium ASP.
However, the roughly similar contribution of mix from Samsung is driven by a
higher number of smartphone models relative to Apple.

Samsung is slowly increasing ASPs, but remains well behind Apple
While Samsung might have some top-end smartphones at comparable prices to
Apple’s, the average ASP for the Samsung portfolio remains well short of Apple’s.
On a year-to-date basis, the average selling price for Apple’s iPhones are $823 (per
IDC), which compares to Samsung’s$340. Over the last ten years, Apple has
increased average ASP by roughly $202 per IDC relative to Samsung’s $135. While
this might indicate more opportunity for Samsung with high-end smartphones, we
think it also indicates that Apple has been more willing to push the pricing barrier in
conjunction with delivering technology feature setsthat are at least in linewith, if not
better than,the best phones in the market.

Volumes for both OEMs have started to plateau
Apple and Samsung have captured most of the market share in premium smartphone
market. Volumes for both OEMs have started to plateau in recent years, which is
likely driven by the maturing penetrationof smartphones in Developed countries.

Samsung is following Apple’s premium pricing strategy
Samsung had historically preferred to price its top-end smartphone at a modest
discount to Apple in a bid to cannibalize revenue from Apple. More recently,
particularly with the recent launch of the Galaxy Note 9, Samsung is now looking to
price smartphones in line with or at a premium to Apple. The pricing likely reflects a
change in strategy and expectation around price elasticity from Samsung. As
reviewed by our Asia Pacific Technology analyst, JJ Park, Samsung likely needs to
increase focus on the incremental feature set delivered in the high-end smartphone to
be able to successfully upsell consumers. See detailed note here: “Samsung
Electronics: Note 9 unpacked: Nothing special withhigher price points”.
iPhone: Is the Pricing Strategy Sustainable?
Smartphones substituting tablets and laptops; consumers willing to attribute
higher share of wallet to smartphone purchase from savings on other devices
One of the primary reasons we believe consumers have been willing to pay an
increasing amount for smartphones is the increasing convergence of capabilities of a
smartphone with those of a tablet and other personal computing devices, including
laptops. The increase in hardware capabilities has not been the sole driver; the
increasing delivery of web-based content through applications customized for
smartphones to keep up with changing consumer preference towards mobility has
driven a convergence of the use cases for smartphones relative to other personal
computing devices.As shown in Table 18, while the mobile handset industry is still
registering modest growth, the marketsfor personal laptops/desktops and tablets are
both declining. With smartphones substituting usage of laptops/desktopsand tablets,
we believe consumersarewilling to attribute incremental share of wallet to the
smartphone, driving limited price elasticity relative to expectations.

Consumers are increasingly spending more time on a smartphone
We believe consumers are spending an increasing amount of time on a smartphone
instead of other devices, including tablets, which saw a rapid increase in usage in the
early part of this decade. The willingness from consumers to pay an increasing
amount for the smartphone has stemmed from their desire tohave a richer experience
on the device on which they are spending an increasing amount of time. For example,
one of the primary drivers for large screen sizes, or “Plus” sized models, was that
consumers were increasingly consuming content on their smartphones and wanted
larger screen sizes to make it more convenient to read/view, which in turn increased
the opportunity for OEMs to raise pricing.
Financing has a lot of headroom to allow pricing to increase
Developed countries, including the US, are seeing a modest headwind on the
replacement cycle for smartphones led by the discontinuation of subsidies by the
carriers to facilitate consumer purchases. However, the headwind is largely being
offset by the increasing penetration of financing plans to make the purchases more
affordable. According to research published by Kantar, 47% of smartphones sold in
the US are linked to installment plans, including 51% of iPhonesand 46% of
Androiddevices.
iPhone: Emerging Counties’ Product and Pricing Strategy
Allows for Best Profits, not Volumes
Limited product positioning for leverage to growth in Emerging countries
Since its launch in 2007, Apple has primarily focused on the premium smartphone
market. However,Apple began designingproduct focused on Emerging countriesin
2013, including withthe 5C and the SE. However, product introductions targeting
the Emerging countrieshave been infrequent, as we believe Apple continues to
prioritize Developed countriesto drive growthas well asthrough increasing revenue
over the lifetime of a smartphone rather than through volumes.
Apple has limited products targeting Emerging countries
Apple has not focused on consistently launching specific products targeting
Emerging countries. Apple’s product strategy has involved positioning the prior
year’s smartphone modelsas the primary product in most of the Emerging countries,
at a significantly lower price than the current generation of smartphones. The
strategy of pushing the prior year’s smartphonesin certain Emerging countries
allows the pricing to be more affordable by the target demographic. Additionally,
with a year of cost reduction opportunities explored on the prior year’s smartphones,
Apple can deliver solid margins despite participating in a more price competitive
market.
Apple’s strategy in Emerging countries offers numerous benefits to financials
long-term
We believe Apple’s strategy in Emerging countries, in contrast to competitive
priority of developing specific products, has several benefits for financials, including:
 Pricing of the primary model in Emerging countries is more affordable for
consumers. With the launch of iPhones every year, the price of the prior year’s
model is trimmed and offers a better price point.


Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018

 Less R&D in developing specific productsfor Emerging countries.With
leverage of existing products, Apple avoids new R&D investments to develop
specific products for Emerging countries.
 Better margins through leverage of costs savings on older generation
product. Thefirm has a year of learnings from product manufacturing to drive
savings, leading to better gross margins on the smartphone model.
 Ability to leverage the investment on one smartphone model for longer
period than the life cycle of the product in Developedcountries. With average
life cycle of a smartphone in North America close to 2.3 years, the positioning of
an older smartphone product inEmerging markets allows the company to fully
leverage the R&D in developing a product for a longer duration, allowingfor
better operating margins than competition.
 Lower incremental marketing spend on new products. Positioning products in
Emerging countries,which already have been launched in Developed countries
the prior year, creates an aspirational value attached tothe product by the
consumer requiring, in our view, limited incremental marketing spend relative to
stand-alone products positioned for the Emerging countries.
While the combination of the above does not allow for strong volume opportunity, as
Apple’s smartphone usually remains at the high-end compared to competitive
offerings, it does optimize the profitability, in our view.
Increasing “wealth” in Emerging countries to drive iPhone adoption
Apple’s pricing strategy allows for the price of the primary iPhone positioned in an
Emerging market to remain more stable than in the Developed markets. While the
price of the prior year’s model is still at the high-endof consumer spending on
smartphones in Emerging markets, we expect more and more consumers to enter the
target demographic for Apple with increasing wealth of consumer in Emerging
countries. As shown in Figure 83and Figure 84, the average selling prices of a
“premium” smartphone in China and India are expected to increase at a robust pace,
but lower than the rise in GDP per capita (which we treat as a proxy for changes in
disposable income in the region).

As shown in Figure 85, average premium smartphone ASP as % of GDP per capita
in 2016 was 2.35% and 3.45% in China and India, respectively, and is expected to
decline through 2022 to 1.76% and 2.33%, respectively. The decline expected over

Applebelieves it is still in the early stages of building its presence in India, including
setting up a channel and working on plans relative to owning retail stores in the
country. Additionally, the company has invested in building a local supply chain for
its smartphones, which is important to meet local regulations and reduce the average
selling price to consumers by avoiding tariffs. Further, with the mobile infrastructure
in the country improving, led by recent investments from Reliance Jio and Bharti
Airtel, Apple feels more confident relative to the replacement cycle driving towards

Estimate installed base of roughly 1bniPhones globally in 2018
As shown in Table 19, we estimate that the installed base of iPhones globally with their first owners is roughly 915mnunits in 2018. However, a portion of
the iPhones sold annually to existing iPhone owners addsto the installed base with secondary owners, which also contributes to the installed base. Including
devices sold to secondary owners, we estimate the total installed base is close to 1.1bndevices. We estimate the growth in the installed base has been inthe
double-digit percentages over the last few years. While we estimate the growth in the installed base will moderate to high-single-digit percentages in the
coming years, the growth in the absolute number of devices should remain close to 0.1bnannually.

Mac: Plateau in Market Volumes and Apple’s Market Share
Mac shipments have plateaued and volumes are likely to remain range bound
As shown in Figure 97, Mac shipments rose strongly in the last decade to reach
18mnunits globallyin 2011.However, since then we believe a variety of headwinds
have limited growth for Mac shipments including: 1)limited growth in laptop
shipments in Developed countries; 2) premium pricing for Mac limiting addressable
markets; 3) shift of content consumption from traditional devices like laptops to
smartphones, which has elongated the replacement cycle for laptops.

Apple gained a modest amount of market share in the industry since the early 2000s.
However, Apple’s market share peaked at 8% in 2015 and has since moderated to
7%.

Apple’s recent product launches have reinvigorated revenue growth
While unit growth for Apple’s laptops has plateaued over the last few years, Apple
continues to report record revenue quarters for Mac laptops, including in FY17 with
$25.9bnof revenue in the September quarter (F4Q17) when revenues increased
+25% y/y. Apple has looked to differentiate its product offering on the basis of
capabilities, driving an increasing number of consumers to switch. Apple estimates
that in the most recent quarters, 60% of Mac purchases were driven by newbuyers as
well as switching customers, including 90% of Mac purchases in China. Most
importantly, the growth in Mac purchases has contributed to double-digit growth in
the installed base of Mac laptops.

Product launches have provided a boost to ASPs
As shown in Figure 104, the recent product refresh, which included increased
capabilities with the MacBook Pro and the iMac, has led to an increase in ASPs for
Apple’s Maclaptopsin 2017 and 2018 on a year-to-date basis. As a point of
reference, the year-to-date ASP of $1,572 for Apple’s Maclaptops is almost 2x the
industry’s ASP of$713.

Expect PC shipments to stabilize in coming years
We believe volumes of personal computing devices will stabilize in coming years.
J.P. Morgan Technology analyst Gokul Hariharanforecasts volume declineof -0.2%
y/y in both 2019E, and 2020E, following greater magnitude of declines in the last
few years (“Global PC and Server Forecasts PCs staying flattish in 2018, Servers
growing at 9% led by hyperscale”).See Table 20and Table 21for details.
Forecast Mac shipments to decline modestly, implying market share losses
We expect Apple to launch more entry-level Macs in the coming years to broaden the
portfolio and target a large demographic. At the same time, we expect Apple to
expand capabilities at the high-end of the portfolio to target gaming demand where
priceelasticity is limited. However, despite these changes in the portfolio, we expect
Apple to give up modest amount of market share, which in turn should drive unit
decline on a y/y basis in the backdrop of a largely flat market. Led by the rebound in
revenue growth in 2017, following MacBook Pro refreshes, we expect Apple’s focus
to remain largely on high-end devices to drive revenue growth even in the absence of
unit growth.

iPad: Product Growth Despite a Challenging Market
iPad successfully created the tablet market
Apple launched the first iPad in April 2010, creating the tablet market, which
immediately gained significant popularity with consumers. The popularity of the
iPad led competitors to quickly follow Apple into the tablet market, which resulted in
moderationof Apple’s market share; however,Apple still remains the largest player
in the category it created. As shown in Figure 105, Apple started with almost 100%
share of the tablet market with the launch of the iPad in 2Q2010. Apple’s market
share moderated over time to as low as 20% by 3Q 2015, prior to the launch of the
iPad Pro, which has driven a recovery in market share.

Despite the moderation in share, Apple is still the leader in the tablet market
As shown in Figure 106, despite the moderation of Apple’s share in the tablet
market, as a result of a fast-follower strategy by competition, the firm still has the
leading share in the tablet market and almost 2x the share of its nearest competitor,
Samsung.

iPad as well as tablet industry volumes have slowed down
As shown in Figure 109and Figure 110, iPadvolumes peaked in 2013 and have
declined since, before finally stabilizing in 2017. The trend in iPad volumes is
similar to that for the industry, despite the industry decline starting in 2014.

Starting in late 2017, iPad units and revenues have rebounded
We believe Apple’s latest refresh of the iPad line-up in 2017, including positioning
the iPad for the education sector as well as pushing for greater enterprise adoption,
has helped drive a recovery in both units and revenue. In calendar 2Q18, Apple
reported the fifth consecutive quarter of iPad revenue growth, including share gains
in China, rest of APAC, and the US, where it has roughly 60% share of the tablet
market. Additionally, Apple believes half of the iPad purchases in the quarter were
for new tablet customers as well as those switching from competitors, which has
further added to the installed base of devices.

iPad ASPs have declined on the launch of lower-price versions
As shown in Figure 111, iPad ASPs havedeclined since introduction in 2010. The
launch of additional lower-price versions, including iPad mini, likely drove the ASP
moderation.

Despite ASP moderation, Apple has increased its premium to the industry
While ASPsfor tablets in the industry have been declining in conjunction with the
decline in ASP for iPads, Apple has been able to expand its premium relative to the
industry by holding off in competing with the less feature-rich and lower-ASP
products introduced by competition. As shown in Figure 112, iPad has been able to
expand the premium relative to the industry from 110% in 2010 and 127% in 2011 to
186% in 2016, 176% in 2017, and 153% in 2018.

Apple Watch: Growth Driver with Enormous Potential
Apple has quickly established itself as a leader in the smart watch market
The first Apple Watch was released on April 24, 2015 and has since gained in
popularity to become the leading smart watch sold globally. As shown in Figure 59,
Apple now has 15% share of the global wearables market, followed by Xiaomi
(14%), Fitbit (13%) and Garmin (5%).

The smart watch market accounts for roughly half of the wearables market
While we have seen a lot of new competition come into the already intensely
competitive wearables market, capabilities are not uniform across smart watches,
which are only a partof the overall wearables market. We estimate smart watches
account for roughly 50% of the overall wearables market. The US smart watch
market is estimated to be about 13mnunits relative to the US wearables market of
30mnunits.
Apple Watch shipments gained momentum in 2017 after taking a pause in 2016
As shown in Figure 114, Apple Watch shipments took a pause after a hugely
successful first year in which the company’sshare rose to 21% of the wearables
market. Subsequently, Apple Watch shipments increased more than 50% y/y in 2017.
Apple has disclosed that Apple Watch shipments continued to report strong growth
in early 2018, including a mid-40% growth rate in the latest quarter.

See upside to industry expectations for market growth
IDC forecasts wearables unit growth to expand at a +12% CAGR through 2022,
providing ample growth opportunities to all companies participating in the market.
Within the wearables market, IDC forecasts the market for smart watches to expand
at a +22% CAGR, from 33mnunits in 2017 to 89mnunits in 2022. We see upside to
these already bullish third-party estimates for unit growth in the smart watch market,
led by the introduction of additional capabilities in smart watches driven by new
digital content and lifestyle tracking features. Additionally, we are in the early stages
of 3G/4G capabilities being incorporated into smart watches, which will provide
additional flexibility to consumers and should drive a replacement cycle for earlier
generation smart watches.

Apple Watch penetration into iPhone installed base still relatively modest
Apple Watch is in almost all circumstances a purchase for a consumer who owns an
iPhone. We see the Apple Watch appealing to all iPhone users, including secondary
owners, as an excellent alternative to traditional watches given increasing features
like the pedometer, heart rate monitor, andnotification of calls and messages. We
estimate that the sale of roughly 14K Apple Watches in FY17 implies only a 1.4%
penetration of the iPhone installed base. We expect the increasing penetration of
Apple Watch sales with iPhone users to continue to drive strong growth in Apple
Watch units, making unit growth more sustainable than investors may expect. Table
22illustrates our estimate for Apple Watch unit sales and the penetration of the
installed base of iPhones.

Theoretically a TAM opportunity of $385bn
Even if Apple’s installed base of iPhones were to plateau today, we estimate Apple
theoretically could still target a revenue opportunity of $385bnwith the Apple Watch
if penetration were to reach closer to 100%. Realistically, the penetration of Apple
Watches in the iPhone installed base will be lower and should ramp up steadily over
time. We expect to see penetration increase in line with gains in the last two years
(see Figure 117), which we believe will result in continued growth for Apple Watch
(see Figure 118).

Total Installed Base Analysis: Switchers to iOS Are Key for
Continued Growth
Key observationsfrom our installed base calculations:
 iPhones are three-fourths of the total installed base, driving increased focus to
continue to grow the iPhone installed base.
 Switchers to iOS devices and replacement demand are key to driving growth in
installed base. With variations in replacement demand likely to be modest at best
through the years, the primary driver of installed base growth should rest onthe
ability to get consumers to switch to iOS.
 As shown in Table 24, if Apple fails to get incremental consumers to switch,
replacement demand and new subscriber demand are unlikely to expand enough
to offset the shortfall, driving a decline in iPhone unit sales.
 As shown in Table 24, decline in iPhone unit sales should lead to only a modest
single-digit increase in the installed base, restricting opportunities to drive both
replacement-led demand and Services revenue growth in the long-run.
 Apple’s strategy to focus on developing the best products, even though at a
premium price, is to drive incremental consumers to switch to the iOS platform,
which is key for growth.

HomePod: Needs More Investments in GTM Strategy
Amazon and Google captured the market early on
Apple launched its smart speaker, the HomePod, in early 2018, almost three years
after Amazon’s launch of its smart speaker, Alexa, in November 2014, and more than
a year after Google announced the launch of the Google Assistant in November
2016. Not only has Apple lost the first-mover advantage in this market, it has also
cededthe installed base to Amazon and Google, which is likely to see a longer life
cycle relative to either the iPhone or the Apple Watch. As shown in Figure 119,
Amazon has 62% share of the smart speaker market, followed by Google at 31%, and
other players being fairly small.

US is the primary market for smart speakers currently; we expect improving
network infrastructure to facilitate growth in international markets
IDC estimates that a total of 43.9mnsmart speakers were sold globally in 2017. Of
the 43.9mnunits sold, IDC estimates that 76% or 33.5mnunits were shipped in the
US. We believe improvement in network infrastructure in international markets will
facilitate stronger adoption of smart speakersin other regions.

Current installed base implies minor penetration of homes
In the US, smart speaker sales rose from 14mnunits in 2016 to 34mnunits in 2017,
more than doubling within a year. While significant, the overall penetration of homes
remains fairly modest. An average of one speaker per home would imply a 25%
penetration rate of the 136mnhouseholds in the US. However, we believe thereal
penetration is potentially much lower at around half that number with an average
household owning two devices instead of one. Undoubtedly, penetration of smart
speakers remains fairly low in international markets.
We expect Apple to further refine the hardware for the HomePod
Apple historically has differentiated its products through superior design and
aesthetics in addition to the capabilities of the product itself. However, we believe
the HomePod, despite being late to the market relative to Amazonand Google, has
failed to appeal to consumers in design and aesthetics. We expect Apple to refine the
product further in coming generations.
Apple Music can be the driver for HomePod sales
While the integration of HomePod with Apple Music could drive growth for Apple
Music subscriptions longer-term, we expect Apple Music will drive HomePod sales
near-term. Specifically, we expect Apple to look to integrate HomePod and Apple
Music into a packaged offering in the near-term as the company looks to leverage the
success of the Apple Music platform, which boasts 50% of the market share in
streaming subscriptions with 43mnmonthly active users in the US.
Despite HomePod’s lackluster start, we do not rule out Apple’s ability to
innovate
While the HomePod has not been a success for Apple to date, we do not rule out
Apple’s ability to innovate in terms of product and strategy to drive adoption. While
admittedly HomePod has lagged competitors in the smart speaker market, Apple has
successfully entered the smart watch market and wireless headphone market over the
last few years and is well on its way to establishing itself as the leader in both. For
example, the Airpods (wireless earbuds) have seen significant success in relatively
short time after their launch in December 2016 and now have 2% share of the total
headphone market (including earphones)organically, and closer to 27% when
including Beats, which Apple acquired in 2014.

Services: Leveraging the Installed Base to Drive Growth
Servicesto be a $68bnbusiness segment by FY21
Apple has inarguably increased its focus on Services in the last few years. The
Services segment comprises revenues from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, and
Apple Care. As shown in Figure 121, Services accounted for only 8% of total
company revenues in FY12, increasing to 13% in FY17. With Apple on track to
easily exceed its target of doubling Services revenuesof $24bnin FY16 by FY20E,
we believe Services will account for around 20% of total company revenues in
FY21E.

Apple is benefiting from growth in theinstalled base and revenue per device
We believe the strong growth in Services revenue is being fueled by the combination
of growth in the installed base as well as the service revenue derived from each
device. As shown Figure 123, we estimate that the installed base of iOS devices
(including secondary users) increased from 1.16bnin FY15, to 1.30bnin FY16,and


Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018

increased from $17in FY15, to $18 in FY16, and to $21in FY17.

Expect revenue per device to increase, led by Apple Care and Apple Music
We expect revenue per device in the installed base to continue to increase in
conjunction with a growing installed base. As shown in Figure 124, we forecast
Service revenue per device to continue to increase at a +16% CAGR from $21 in
FY17 to $38in FY21. We expect the primary driver of the increase to be the higher
adoption of Apple Care services (across the portfolio and across greater number of
points in the indirect channel for Apple) and Apple Music.

Apple does not disclose the mix of its $22bnin Services revenue. We estimate the
mix ofServices revenue is weightedtowards purchasesin theApp Store as well as
purchasesof Apple Care. However, in additionto continued growth in App Store
revenues, we expect to see additional drivers in the form of Apple Music and Apple
Pay. The next section takes a deeper dive into these two relatively new services.

Apple Music: A Service Offering as Good as It Sounds
Formidable addition to the Apple ecosystem
Apple Music, which launched in June of 2015, is an ad-free music streaming service
that boasts a collection of 50mnsongs. Apple offers Apple Music initially as a three-
month free trial, after which consumers have the option to choose from various
monthly subscriptions at different price points, which fluctuates from country to
country. For example, customers can choose between a Student subscription at
$4.99/month, an Individual subscription at $9.99/month, and a Family subscription at
$14.99/month(e.g.,access for up to six people) in the US. Apple Music is available
in 100 countries worldwide and, more importantly, on all Apple devices (including
CarPlay) as well as non-Apple PCs, Android devices, and Sonos devices through
iTunes or various “app stores”.
Changing consumer preferences have led tothe rise of streaming music
The music industry has seen a fundamental change over the last decade. The era of
downloading music to a device and revenue models dependent on downloads has
been replaced to a large extent by music as a service in the form of monthly
subscriptions to users. The number of people who pay to stream music has grown at
a +54% CAGR since 2012,culminating in an estimated 176 million people globally
who stream music. This rise in steaming music has disrupted the traditional
incumbents in the music industry and driven a change in business models for most
music companies in order to survive. Additionally, it has led to an increased
incentive for music distributors like Apple and Spotify to engage with musicians,
producers, and music labels to create exclusive relationships to differentiate their
streaming services relative to competition.

Streaming music drives growth in the music industry as a whole
The music industry had been struggling and revenues were declining drastically led
by illegal downloads and unwillingness of consumers to pay for individual
downloads. As shown inFigure 127,IFPI, a not-for-profit international organization
registered in Switzerland and representing the recording industry,estimates that
worldwide revenues for the recorded music industry declined from $20bnin 2000 to
aslow as $14bnby 2014 representing the challenges faced by the music industry in
the early 2000s. However, with increasing adoption of streaming, the industry started
to see an increase in total revenues and has nowreached an estimated $19bnin 2018.

While streaming services have had a strong pace of growth starting from 2014, the
contribution of non-streaming services to overall revenues has declined rapidly.
Streaming revenues are expected to continue to grow at a brisk pace offsetting the
decline in alternate means of music distribution.

Streaming growing at a solid pace and taking over the primary role from
downloads
Taking a closer look at Digital Music revenues, we see the increase in streaming
revenues complementing the decline in revenues through downloads. The +17%
CAGR for Digital music revenues from 2012to 2017comprises a +59% revenue
CAGR for streaming, partly offset by the -11% decline in revenues from downloads.
As shown in Figure 129, streaming overtook contribution from downloads to total
industry revenues in 2015, and streaming has continued to post strong growth since
then.

Adoption of streaming music continues to increase
The easier access to music provided to consumers through streaming services has led
to consumers spending more time consuming music content. In the United States, for
example, consumers were listening to approximately 23 hours of music per week in
2015, which increased to 32 hours per week in 2017. We expect increasing

popularity of streaming services to continue to engage consumers further on their
platforms.

addition to the Apple Services platform
Smartphones have become the primary device of choice for consumers when it
comes to streaming music. While only 50% of consumers were using the smartphone
for streaming music in 2015, by the end of 2017 the percentage had increased to
90%.The tie-in of streaming music on the smartphone makes Apple Music a great
addition to the Apple Services portfolio.

Apple Music MAUs have grown at +75% CAGR through mid-2018
Apple Music was launched in the summer of 2015 and gained 10mn paid subscribers
by the end of that year (in just six months). Most recently, Apple announcedthat
Apple Music had surpassed 50mn+ monthly active users (MAUs). We estimate that
Apple can end FY18E with roughly 54mnusers and continue to drive solid growth in
MAUs to more than double the subscriber base by end of FY21E.

Apple Music’s growth is impressive, but Spotify still holds the streaming crown
Spotifyrecentlyannounced that it had surpassed 180mn MAUs, with 83mnof those
users paying for the premium service. The difference of 180mn Spotify MAUs
versus Apple Music’s 50mn+appears daunting, but one must consider that Apple
Music does not offer a free ad-supported version of its service, so the true
comparison has to be between Spotify’s 83mn MAUs and Apple’s 50mn+MAUs.
While Spotify as a service can monetize the free subscriber base for advertisement
revenues, Apple continues to prioritize user experience for paying consumers. As
shown in Figure 133, Spotify has been growing users rapidly as well and currently is
the leader in the streaming market.

Globally Spotify is the leader; however,domestically Apple is roughly at par
While globally Spotify is the leader in streaming services, the user base is much
more balanced in the US led by the tie-in of the smartphone to the choice of a
subscription service and the high share for Apple in the US smartphone market. We
estimate that Apple has roughly half of its subscriber base in the US, i.e.,around
21mnusers, which compares to Spotify’s American user base of around 22mn.
Additionally, with higher growth for Apple in the US relative to Spotify, we estimate
Apple can soon surpass Spotify’s domestic user base.

the presence of Spotify and JPM estimatesthat the subscription service can reach
approximately 1.5bn subscribers in those markets. Adding to this the 62 countries in
which Apple Music and Spotify both operate brings in another 1.2bn potential

Apple is positioned to address a large TAM with localized pricing
In the countries where Apple Music is available, our JPM Internet team observes that
Apple Music is an affordable service, making up only 1% of household expenditures.
The service is most expensive in Europe, at approximately $11.09/month on average
for anindividual plan. This is especially striking when compared to regions such as
South America and Africa where the individual subscription is offered for
$4.20/month on average. In the U.S, Apple Music is $9.99/month for the individual
plan and $14.99/monthfor the family plan (up to six users). According to the 2017
IFPI Consumer Insight report, roughly 22% of streaming plans are family plans.

Apple Music sees higher conversion rate of trial subscribers into paying
subscribers
Apple’s growth is assisted by the three-month free trial, which is the company’s
primary way of gaining new paying MAUs. Unlike Spotify, Apple Music does not
offer a free ad-supported version of the product so reliance on the teaser free trial is
vital to new consumer onboarding. One year after Apple Music’s launch in mid-
2015, Apple Music had a total of 33mn subscribers, with only 17mn paid
subscribers, representing roughly 50%conversion rate. Now, three years after launch
in 2018, Apple Music has 50mn+subscribers in total, with 40mn of them paying
subscribers, representing an increase of the conversion rate to 80%.

Apple Music’s retention rate nears Netflix levels of loyalty
Netflix, like Apple Music, does not have an ad-supported subscription,but rather a
similar one-month free trial system to attract and retain new consumers. While
Netflix has different business priorities, focusing more on original content generation
and is in the video streaming industry, it is still an interesting comparison to make
due to their similar free trial and no free ad-supported model. We believe Netflix has
enjoyed ~90% retention post free trial, something that Apple Music is trending
towards.
Apple Music subscribers to account for a larger percentage of Apple device
owners
We believe one of the drivers of growth for Apple Music will be the increase in
penetration of subscribers in the installed base, in addition to benefits from the
incremental increase in the installed base on an annual basis.We expect the tight
coupling of the iPhone,the Apple Watch, and the HomePod with the Apple Music
subscription will enable growth in subscriptions for Apple Music within existing
installed base of devices. We estimate the penetration of Apple Music is quite low
and in the low-single-digit range at this time. We expect growth in subscribers for
Apple Music to be driven by an increase in penetration for Apple Music
subscriptions within the installed base and with existing Apple users. Figure 140
shows our estimates.

Strong relationship with artists and music labels part of Apple Music’s long-
term strategy
It is crucial to have a good working relationship with existing music labels and artists
to ensure availability of quality content on the platform, but also in some cases use
the relationships to create exclusivity for content and drive differentiation for the
platform relative to competition. Apple is at an advantage over Spotify as it has the
financial abilityto deploy significantly moreresources towardsimproving the
company’s product. Spotify pays approximately 71.7% of revenue to labels and
publishers while Apple pays closer to 73%. Additionally, Apple pays 62% more to

margins could be lower on the higher payout, we believe it is likely to be a driver
towards long-term differentiation.

Apple Music potentially opens up the opportunity for introduction of
original content in the future
In a 2017 Bloomberg interview Jimmy Iovine, one of the heads of Apple Music,
expressed that Apple could potentially include original video content into the music
streaming service.More recent comments by Apple executives have indicated that
the firm is investing heavily in delivering original content, although it has not
disclosed any details. As shown in Figure 143, video already accounts for 55% of
streaming. We believe video streaming and original content are going to be next big

Apple Pay: Cashing In on Mobile Payments
Apple Pay set to leveragethe move to digital money
Apple Pay, which was launched in October of 2014, is a mobile payment and digital
wallet service that allows consumers to make secure payments in stores, apps, and
websitesas well as send and receive money via Apple Messages or Siri. In addition,
Apple Pay includes the Wallet app, which stores the Apple Pay Cash card (“digital
money”), credit cards, debit cards, as well as other items, such as boarding passes,
tickets, and reward cards. The Wallet app supports most major credit cards and debit
cards around the world. Apple Pay is available on most Apple devices, including the
iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch, that have some combination of at least two user
identifications or “two-factor authentication” (e.g.,passcode, PIN, Touch ID or Face
ID). Apple Pay incorporates near field communication (NFC) in order to enable
wireless payments via point-of-salesystems. Utilizing this technology, Apple Pay
supports contactless in-person payments via the iPhoneand Apple Watch, which is
generally faster than average card transactions.Importantly, Apple does not store
card numbers on the device itself or on any of its servers.Instead,Apple Pay uses a
device-specific number and uniquetransaction code; thus,consumers’card numbers
are never shared by Apple with merchants.
Credit and debit card purchase volume growth a positive trend for Apple Pay
As illustrated in Figure 144, JPM Paymentsanalyst Tien-tsin Huangexpects the
aggregate credit and debit card purchase volume for Visa and Mastercard to grow
10% from $11trn in 2017 to $15trn in 2020, which is a positive trend for Apple Pay,
as credit card transactions of Apple device owners are increasingly being done
through Apple Pay. Importantly, creditand debitcard transactions only accounted for
23% of GDP, which is estimated to be closer to 30% in 2020, implying a significant
growth opportunity for Apple Pay going forward.

Growing usage of mobile payments by consumers
As seen in Figure 145, mobile payment users rose +36% y/y to 721mnin 2017 and
are expected to continue to increase at an +13% CAGR through 2020. Importantly,
that growth rate is even higher for smartphone mobile payment users. Specifically,
smartphone mobile payment users rose +67% y/y to roughly 240mnin 2017 and are
expected to expand at a +19% CAGR through 2020.

As seen in Figure 147, the installed base of NFC-readyPOS terminals stood at 55mnin 2017 and is expected to grow +16% per year to112mnin 2022, which we think is being supported by Visa’sand Mastercard’s recentmandatesthat all POS terminals be NFC enabled by 2020.

Apple Pay also entering the P2P payment market with Apple Pay Cash
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) payment has also seen a rise in consumer adoption given its
ability to transfer money from one person to another person in a relatively seamless
manner, unlike traditional methods that require the use of the banking system. Apple
Pay Cash, launched in December of 2017, allows users to transfer and receive
money, via Apple Messenger or Siri, free of charge when using a debit card and
includes a 3% charge when using a credit card. Additionally, after receiving money,
users can store the money in their Apple Pay Cash card, which is stored in the Wallet
app. To that end, we think the strong adoption of P2P payments is most evident by
Venmo’s (owned by PayPal) recent success as seen in Figure 148. Specifically,
Venmo’s purchase volumes have increased at a +115% CAGR since 2015.

Well-Expected Spec Upgrades for New iPhones
Apple introduced new iPhones (LCD iPhone XR and OLED iPhones XS/XS Max)
and Apple Watch Series 4 at an event on September 12. The specs are largely in line
with our forecast from October 2017and market expectations, whereas the starting
price is slightly above market expectation (LCD iPhone price starting $749, instead
of $699).Key spec changes/upgrades include:
 Display: 6.1” LCD for iPhone XR and 5.8”/6.5” OLED for iPhone XS/XS Max,
all with edge-to-edge display.
 AP: Faster and more powerful A12.
 Memory:DRAM is upgraded from 2GB (iPhone 8) and 3GB (8 Plus/X) to 3GB
(iPhone XR) and 4GB (iPhone XS/XS Max); for NAND, the highest spec is
migrated to 512GB.
 Camera:Both OLED models carry dual cameras and dual-OIS; LCD model has
continued with single camera.
 Touch:LCD iPhone XR has adopted out-cell X-Y touch but has removed 3D
touch.
 Dual-sim:All models will support dual-sim (Nano-SIM and e-SIM), with iPhone
XS Max and iPhone XR in China supporting two physical SIMs due to
unavailability of e-SIM.
 Casings:iPhone XR colors now include Yellow, White, Coral, Black, Blue, and
Red.
 Acoustic:All models adopt a powerful receiver similar to iPhone X.
 Waterproof: iPhone XS/XS Max are upgraded to IP68 rating waterproof.

Apple Watch sees a strong upgrade –units likely to keep surprising
Apple Watch units have been growing ~40% yoy, after the launch of the LTE-
enabled Apple Watch. The Series 4 launch also is a strong upgrade in the product
line-up, with 30% larger screen size and broader price coverage. We believe this is
positive for Quanta (main EMS)andASE (SiP module).
The Higher Price and Tariff Uncertainties to Cap Demand
iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are available from Sep 21 in 33 countries with prices
from $999 and$1099 respectively, which is in line with expectations, similar to
iPhone X last year. iPhone XR will start pre-orders from Oct 19 and shipping from
Oct 26 in 59 countries with price from $749, similar to our preview but a tad more
expensive than market consensus at $699. The available timing for LCD iPhone is
also later than expected and one month behind the OLED iPhones.
Given the higher entry price range and the lingering trade tariff uncertainties, we
believe flat Y/Y comp would be a challenging goal to achieve. We already witness
some Asia iPhone suppliers revisingdown outlook, likely driven by muted initial
volumesfor iPhone XS. However, we do not expect order cut on iPhone XR before
the phone is on the market in late October. Weexpect negative sentiment across the
Apple names whereas iPhone XS/XS Max plays including Largan(dual-lens), Alps
(dual-OIS), LG Innotek (dual-camera), AAC (acoustic component), Samsung
(OLED), and Honhai (casing and assembly) may see largerswing in the next month.

Low Volume Expectation in 2H18; Position for 2019
Upgrade
The Apple Supply China Index has underperformed the Bloomberg APAC Tech
Index by over the past month. Wethink the Street expectations are fairly low but
Apple supply chain stocks are likely to staymuted for the next few monthsunless
any positive data flow.
However, we believe the market focus byyear end will shift to 2019 iPhone, which
may see the most significant design change and upgrade in rear camera. We believe
chances for both OLED iPhone models to incorporate Triple Camera plusTime-of-
flight (“ToF”) 3D sensing in 2019 are high, and the LCD model willlikely be
upgraded to dual camera from single.The key beneficiaries in Asia would be Win
Semi, LG Innotek, and Largan. Seeour Global 3D Sensing & Triple Camera
sector report.We are also positive on TSMC, AAC, Chipbond, Catcher, Flexium
and Pegatron in Asia.

At a Glance
OUR INVESTMENT THESIS
Our investment thesis is that AMZN has several hidden value multipliers that suggest it is worth between $4,500 and $5,000/share. We
call these AMZN's: 1) TAM Expansion Multiplier; 2) Services Company (not Product) Multiplier; 3) $600B of Media Asset Value (largely
hidden) Multiplier; and 4) Ecosystem Value Multiplier. We believe that Services Segment revenue and margins (including advertising and
subscription) are growing faster than AMZN's ecommerce assets, which implies valuation multiple expansion over time. Also, we believe
that AMZN invests billions of dollars every quarter in growth initiatives, which understates the normalized economic power of its assets.
Additionally, AMZN has an outstanding 15-year track record of turning its growth investments into new businesses with high ROIs, such
as AWS and Advertising.

Consumers have changed not just where they shop but how they transact: We asked which new habit formed during the pandemic
would remain after it’s over. Over 41% of consumers indicated they’d shop for most products online and have products delivered to them;
we see this as a positive for Amazon (AMZN) in particular and it should reinforce Prime membership. About 19% indicated they’d buy
online and do curbside pickup while 15.5% indicated they’d buy online and pick up in store. Only 24% of respondents voted to go back to
their old habits by vising stores. For most retailers, foot traffic has been cut in half or worse during the pandemic, and our survey results
keep us cautious on the timing and magnitude of their recovery.
Why drives AMZN's loyalty? We also asked the biggest reason for shopping Amazon. About 49% voted that it’s because Amazon sells
virtually everything, >31% preferred its fast and free shipping for Prime members, 14% like it for its low prices, and 6% liked having access
to Prime Video and other benefits. In our view, AMZN’s scale and industry-leading shipping abilities will remain competitive moats that’ll
be difficult for competitors to replicate.

VALUATION (PRICE TARGET: $3,700.00)
■ Our AMZN price target is based on a DCF valuation. We use a WACC of 6.5% and a long-term nominal growth rate of 2%. The standard
DCF is widely used on Wall Street because it is rigorous bottom-up valuation of the enterprise based on discounting its long-term cash
flows and removing the impact of non-cash accounting conventions.
■ Our AMZN price target embeds a 10-year growth rate of 12.5% annually beginning in FY21, and represents a 26.5x multiple of forward
year (FY22E) EBITDA.
POTENTIAL UPSIDE DRIVERS
AMZN's investment positives include an enormous TAM, rapidly growing market share of e-commerce gaining revenue from offline retail,
Services revenue raises profit margins and ROICs, a strong balance sheet and a best-in-class consumer brand.
RISKS TO TARGET
Risks to our AMZN target price include significant extra COVID-19 costs in 2Q20, regulatory risks, competition, investment ROIs, and/
or economic weakness/recession.

Apple’s guidance for the December quarter indicates growth in revenue and
EPS, even at the low end of the range. That growth might be low single-digits,
but it’s growth nonetheless for a stock that is discounting a fear of revenue and
EPS declines. CEO Tim Cook also indicated that iPhone units would grow,
which should be welcome news to investors after recent soft commentary
from US wireless operators about upgrade rates.
While there are plenty of adjustments within our financial model, we continue
to expect Apple to generate $10 in EPS in Fiscal 2016, reflecting 8% EPS
growth, thanks to the continued aggressive share repurchase. This may be a
slowdown from the 43% growth in Fiscal 2015, but we believe it should be
enough to deserve a 16.0x P/E multiple and $160 price target for Apple, given
the strong free cash flow conversion.
iPhones
Over the past week, the commentary from US operators about declining
phone upgrade rates was starting to concern us, but apparently China
continues to chug along unabated, with mainland units growing 120% during
the quarter. As we learn more about phone upgrade programs, we agree with
management’s assessment that the benefit might actually be larger in future
years than what they are seeing now. We also think there is an opportunity for
Apple to expand its own upgrade program internationally, which could further
accelerate replacement rates.
We maintained our estimate of 80 million iPhone units sold in the December
quarter, recognizing that the US might not be as strong as we first thought.
We took down our March estimate to 62.5 million units from 66 million in
recognition of the potential impact of launching the iPhone into 50 markets
earlier than we expected. Our new estimate reflects 2.2% unit growth in the
March quarter and 5% growth for the year. We maintain our estimate of 4%
ASP erosion in Fiscal 2016 as it seems implausible that Apple can continue the
5 consecutive quarters of annual iPhone ASP growth. The net impact is for
slight growth in revenue for iPhones in 2016.
iPads
iPads continue to disappoint, declining y/y for the seventh consecutive quarter.
However, the ASP outlook is improved based on the current quarter’s results
and the launch of the iPad Pro. As a result, our estimate for a decline in iPad
revenue was cut in half to -5% from -10% in Fiscal 2016.
Services
There are several factors that have led us to increase our services revenue by
$1.7 billion for Fiscal 2016. The proliferation of Apple products globally from
new and used purchases is leveraging the launch of Apple Music and obvious
traction in Apple Pay, which got an added boost from a new deal with
American Express for international use. Our new expectation of 10% growth is
in-line with the growth rate Apple delivered in Fiscal Q4 and all of Fiscal 2015,
yet the dynamics for accelerating growth are clearly present.

Apple Watch
While Apple does not report Apple Watch revenue or units, we estimate it sold
3.5 million in the quarter, generating $1.5 billion in revenue. We cut our Fiscal
2016 Apple Watch unit estimate by 15 million, to 35 million, resulting in a $6.3
billion negative impact to our Fiscal 2016 estimate. Those cuts were offset
partially by higher revenue estimates for AppleTV and iPod refresh.
Tax rate and share repurchase
There is no change to our overall operating margins as a slight increase in our
gross margin estimate was offset by slight increases in R&D and SG&A. Higher
other income and a 30 basis point reduction in our estimated tax rate helped
offset some of the operating reductions detailed above.
Apple bought back $13.3 billion of stock during the quarter versus our estimate
of $12.5 billion. The purchases were also completed at an effective price of
$109 versus our $130 estimate at the start of the quarter, resulting in 26 million
more shares purchased than we estimated. This helped to offset a $1 billion
reduction in our Net Income estimate based on the adjustments above.
Where are we versus consensus?
Our $3.30 FQ1 EPS estimate is at the high end of management’s implied
guidance range and $0.08 above consensus going into last night’s report. Our
$10 Fiscal 2016 EPS estimate is $0.20 above consensus. Our revenue estimates
are $1 billion higher than consensus for FQ1 and $2.7 billion for the year.
Buy
Apple is converting 30% of its revenue into free cash flow, generating $70
billion of free cash flow annually. This implies an 11% FCF yield relative to its
$650 billion market cap. That is simply too high of a yield given its market
position, expectation of growth and high margins, regardless of the much
lower level of revenue growth and EPS expectations for 2016 detailed above.
Even with no growth in EPS, we believe Apple’s valuation is too low based on
cash generation. Apple bought back over 5% of its stock over the past year
and will buy in another 6% this year if the stock remains at these levels. . Our
$160 price target is based on 16x our Fiscal 2016 EPS estimate of $10.

Amazon: Initiating With Buy Rating and $1920 YE2019 Price
Target
INTRODUCTION
Initiating coverage on Amazon with a Buy rating and $1920 YE2019 price target. Amazon is one of the
world’s largest retailers (with a sideline in fast-growing and high-margin advertising activities) and also owns one
of the world’s largest software businesses. Despite its current massive size, we see Amazon’s opportunities as
mostly unconstrained based on a successful track record of capitalizing on consumer and IT department
spending. In the remainder of this note we provide further details on how we think about the company’s future
revenue and profitability trends, looking at the retail business separately from AWS. We also assess other
valuation considerations which lead us to our $1920 YE2019 price target. With a stock trading more than 15%
below this level at the present time, we initiate coverage with a Buy recommendation.
REVENUE FORECAST
Amazon is massive, but small in context of the commercial opportunity the company is pursuing. With a
focus on selling as many consumer goods as possible and much success in attempting to do so, we see
Amazon‘s retail activities as a play on global consumer spending, which is much broader than pure retail or
today’s e-commerce business. In terms of thinking about the market opportunity, we would point to a recent
Euromonitor estimate of global consumer spending as equalling $45 trillion in 2018. Given Amazon’s ambitions
and its demonstrated abilities, we think this is a reasonable TAM (total addressable market) to consider. To
calculate Amazon’s share of this TAM, we assume revenue from its marketplace is derived from a 15% take-rate,
which leads to a global GMV for Amazon of around $405 billion during 2018. Including revenue from subscriptions
(appropriate, given the inclusion of Prime in that line item) we can estimate that Amazon captured $420 billion of
consumer-related activity. From this we calculate an approximate 1% share of its TAM potential.
Of course, a TAM defined so broadly is intended to convey that there is significant ongoing growth potential for
the company. In lieu of meaningful new initiatives or acquisition-related activity, we would expect that growth can
continue at incrementally diminished rates vs. the recent past. Acceleration is unlikely (if not implausible) given
the difficulty any company would face in sustaining or meaningfully improving upon prior growth which build on
Amazon’s already-massive scale. With this philosophy underpinning our numbers, we have arrived at a growth
rate for non-AWS-related businesses of around +22% in both 2017 and 2018 pro forma for 2017 transactions
(which primarily means Whole Foods), declining towards +13% in 2023 and then on towards a ~+6% growth rate
outside of recessionary periods by 2030.
While a model based upon diminishing growth is simplistic, we arrived at this approach after determining it was
more appropriate than other methods of forecasting. Initially we attempted to assess the total addressable market
for e-commerce at global and regional levels with an eye towards estimating Amazon’s share of that market at
any given time. However, we found limitations in data available and further limitations in applying that data to
Amazon specifically for several reasons:
• E-commerce retail sales data (as produced by the US Commerce Department and Census Bureau, for
example), while likely an accurate reflection of a fixed definition of e-commerce, won‘t reflect the
increasingly omni-channel nature of retail. Platforms such as Amazon are likely to increasingly rely on
physical locations as much as traditional retailers such as Walmart and Target will increasingly rely on
their digital platforms to sell products and provide customers with related information. Amazon will be
increasingly indifferent as to whether or not a sale is fulfulled in part or in whole online or at a store.
- 2 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group

• Modelling Amazon’s revenue share against broader retail sales data won’t capture that Amazon will
increasingly look to non-retail forms of consumer spending as a source of revenue growth, as with their
efforts in entertainment services and healthcare.
• Using market share estimates for a global company is even more difficult because of the amount of cross-
border buying activity that occurs. Our understanding is that any data tracking e-commerce sales for a
given country will not capture spending which originated in a separate country. This distorts attempts to
model market share at anything less than a global level.
We see several of the company’s revenue streams as fluid for purposes of modelling. We first consider the
company’s retail, marketplace and subscription-related businesses to be a relatively fluid set of revenue streams
with any one category of revenue as replacable by any one of the others. Our conversations with industry
participants have left us with an understanding that Amazon may prioritize or deprioritize different activities, all
with an eye towards optimizing their relationships with consumers.
• On first glance at Amazon, one might assume that marketplace / third-party sales are more desirable for
Amazon vs. first-party sales given higher margins and greater scale potential. However, we understand
that the company benefits in many ways from sustaining a robust first-party business, including the
capacity to produce more high margin private label goods, a superior ability to manage their overall
customer relationships and a better strategic read on the economics of other retailers and manufacturers
who use the marketplace.
• As described above, we see Amazon as ultimately indifferent between online/delivery or physical store-
based fulfulllment given the timeliness of picking up certain goods, the balance of consumer interests
between online and in-person shoping for many catgeries and a competitive environment which is
increasingly omnichannel.
• Subscriptions could theoretically serve as an incremental revenue stream, except that most of the
company’s subscription revenue is via Prime, which is likely best viewed as part of a given consumer’s
overall spending on products at Amazon. And even if we only look at future subscription services we can
envision that Amazon will price services in context of those services‘ contributions to increased spending
on retail products.
Advertising is related to the retail opportunity, but also somewhat independent. The company generated
around $9bn of related revenue in 2018. Grouped under Other revenues (with probably 90% of those revenues
accruing to advertising), Amazon’s approach to advertising is centered around helping the company reduce prices
consumers pay for products. For this reason, in some ways advertising is a means to an end rather than the end
itself at Amazon. However, because of Amazon’s scale and the desirability of its data and ad inventory,
advertising should be able to provide an opportunity for incremental growth that is independent of consumer
spending trends.
Amazon was on pace to generate well over $10bn in Other revenue during 2018, which we think includes around
$9bn from advertising, the bulk of which ran in the US. Of the $9bn, around $3bn may have originated with co-op
or trade-related promotion budgets, equivalent to 2-3% of the company’s first-party sales. In general we think
these budgets should grow at least as fast as Amazon’s first-party sales, but they could grow faster as fast
moving consumer goods (FMCGs) become increasingly important suppliers of goods to the company (our
understanding is that companies in this sector can invest as much as 20% of their revenue in trade promotion
programs with retailers, although we have also heard that the figure can be as low as 2% for some brands).
We assume the remainder, or around $6bn of ad revenue, is derived from conventional digital advertising
budgets. This pool of spending represents a more significant opportunity for Amazon than trade promotion
- 3 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group

budgets. We estimate the company recognized $5bn in US advertising revenue from conventional ad budgets
during 2018 (out of a digital ad market we estimate was worth $106bn), with a large percentage of those sales
made possible with inventory outside of Amazon’s owned and operated platforms. Although large brands are
allocating growing shares of their budgets to Amazon inventory, the growing numbers of third-party merchants on
Amazon’s marketplace might be increasing their spending in a more aggressive manner, prioritizing Amazon’s
relatively scarce O&O advertising “real estate.” If this occurs, the larger brands who pioneered the use of that
inventory would probably respond by increasingly using Amazon’s DSP / managed service to buy inventory off the
platform.
The separation between trade and brand budgets is important for investors to consider, not least as it
impacts how investors should think about the advertising revenue potential for Amazon and the opportunity (or
lack of an opportunity) for new budgets to flow into the industry. Conversations with large advertisers have
conveyed to us that there is no one-size fits all approach to budgeting for Amazon, with some integrating activities
between brand and trade promotion budgets, but those examples appeared to be the exception rather than the
rule. Beyond bureaucratic considerations (with trade sales and marketing teams typically reporting through very
different lines in their companies, with very different business objectives and separate budgets) in some instances
avoidance of co-ordination is intentional: several large marketers cited to us the US Robinson-Patman Act (a law
which bars price discrimination – including compensation for advertising and other services – between
manufacturers and similar types of retailers) as a factor limiting the degree to which brand and trade teams co-
ordinate their efforts.
To the extent that budgets flow into Amazon from other sources, we have learned of a range of different
approaches that different marketers take. We have heard from some marketers who will fund search on
Amazon from Google budgets, but also heard from others who will leave search on Amazon to the trade team to
fund in isolation from other budgets. Display budgets could flow from general display advertising or from
Facebook or Google or anywhere else. And of course, as Amazon develops its connected TV offerings and
ultimately makes more of its original programming available on an ad-supported basis, it will probably be able to
compete for TV budgets. Amazon’s Fire TV box is a key initiative in helping the company monetize other
programmers‘ connected TV inventory, and conversations we have had with industry participants convey to us
that Fire is well-positioned to compete with Roku or other sellers of connected TV ad inventory.
Separately, we think that smaller advertisers or those who primarily sell their goods on the web (especially
through Amazon’s marketplace) are more likely to allocate a generally fixed percentage of their sales to Amazon
ad inventory. Those same advertisers are also likely to be willing to pay relatively higher prices given the relative
ease with which they can connect ad impressions to sales (at least vs. larger brands, where making such
assessments are much harder).
Accounting for these factors, we forecast $38bn in revenue by 2023, with advertising growing faster than
any other revenue stream at Amazon. For 2018 we estimate advertising is growing by close to +70% on an
underlying basis (excluding the accounting change that caused Amazon to recognize trade promotion ad
spending as revenue rather than a reduction in costs of goods sold) and assume deceleration in subsequent
years to arrive at an estimate of $33bn in conventional ad revenue (or $38bn including trade promotion budgets)
by 2023. For reference, Interpublic’s Magna estimates total digital advertising of $406bn at that time, or $339bn
outside of China, where Amazon might be harder-pressed to compete for ad budgets vs. the rest of the world. At
around 10% of the global total in 2023, Amazon will easily be the “third force“ in digtial advertising after Google
and Facebook, although it will still be substantially smaller than the $215bn in annual revenue we expect Google
to generate or the $59bn we expect to see from Facebook.
We recognize that there are obstacles which need to be overcome for Amazon to sustain the growth that we
expect: conversations with buyers convey that Amazon’s ad products remain very limited in their features vs.
pure-play ad tech competitors, and do not yet have comprehensive capabilities around brand safety, for example.
- 4 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group

Improvements are likely to be made over time, helping the company secure a growing “share of wallet” among
existing domestic customers. Further, the company will need to enhance its selling efforts and succeed in selling
to non-endemic marketers (i.e. those with products in categories which don’t tend to sell on Amazon or via e-
commerce), who today likely account for a small share of the Amazon’s ad revenues.
We see AWS as entirely separate from the retail business, and also see the division as capable of
continously growing by sustaining its existing revenue streams and expanding with new products in the
future. A remarkable growth story in its own right, AWS should end 2018 as a business with more than $25bn in
revenue, by itself almost as large as the world’s fourth largest software company, SAP. With significant revenue
streams from storage, computing, networking and other software, Amazon has firmly established itself as capable
of deploying new products and servicing IT departments of companies large and small around the world.
To model revenue growth at AWS, we recognize that we might look at TAMs for AWS‘ core products and make
estimates of AWS‘ share and the trajectory of its share. However, this would ignore that Amazon is undoubtedly
going to continue expanding its product offerings as well, including an expansion beyond software to include more
hardware, too. For reference, Gartner estimated in October that global enterprise software spending was to be
$405bn during 2018. Enterprise-focused hardware would add to this figure as would other forms of IT spending,
which was forecast to total $3.7 trillion in 2018, including devices, IT services and communications services.
With substantial upside potential for AWS and a strong track record, we think we can safely assume significant
ongoing revenue growth for the foreseeable future. Reinforcing this point, as of the end of 3Q18, the company
had a $17.8bn revenue backlog associated with AWS for contracts whose terms exceed one year and which were
not otherwise reflected in its financial statements, with an average contract life of 3.5 years (implying ~$5bn of
revenues to be generated each of the next 3.5 years from sales activities which were already performed).
Notably, the $17.8bn figure was up from $16.0bn in 2Q18 and $12.4bn in 1Q18.
KEY ECONOMIC RISKS
Concerns about an economic downturn are worth considering in looking at Amazon, although not explicitly
incorporated into our model at this time, which assumes ongoing economic growth for the foreseeable future.
While AWS probably holds up well because of the secular growth trends it is driving and the long-term contracts it
has with many of its customers, the retail business might face risks because of the relative maturity of e-
commerce and likelihood that consumer spending trends would probably negatively impact the company in a way
they didn’t during the last recession. As well, overall digital advertising budgets would probably be cut if the
economy weakened materially.
To the extent that concerns around economic weakness in China play out, Amazon might be negatively impacted
to the degree that many of the companies using its marketplace and advertising products are based there. One
intelligence firm (Marketplace Pulse) published an estimate late last year indicating that 39% of the Amazon
marketplace’s top sellers in the top five European markets were based in China, up from 15% two years earlier.
They estimate that the share of US revenues from Chinese third-party sellers is likely higher than the 39% figure.
Changes to postal regulations which could impact the cost of shipping both internationally and domestically could
also factor into Amazon’s business over time.
PROFIT MARGIN FORECAST
We model Amazon’s margins in terms of a) AWS and b) everything else as two separate pools of profitability. We
model taxes in a manner that is generally consistent with our outlook for other companies.
- 5 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group

Our model incorporates an assumption that Amazon’s non-AWS revenues will generate a 5.0% operating
income margin in the long-run. In the United States, retailers earn a slightly-better-than 3% after-tax profit
margin on average, according to data from the US Census Bureau. This should equate to a slightly-better-than
4% operating income margin. There are clearly advantages to scale: industry-leader Walmart has earned
operating income margins of 5-6% over the past few years.
When assessing what 5.0% means, we think it’s important to note that Amazon’s accounting choices
differ from its peers. Looking at regional data for North America – excluding AWS, but including third-party sales
– Amazon produced a 5% margin over the last twelve months (3Q17 through 3Q18), up from 2% in the prior
calendar year period and 3% in the year before that one. Importantly, it’s worth noting that Amazon recognizes
both stock-based compensation expense and depreciation on an accelerated basis (unique among stocks we
cover).
Consider that depreciation alone (including amortization of property and equipment acquired under capital leases,
but excluding other amortization related to internal software development and capitalized content costs)
amounted to $3.0bn in Amazon’s North America segment during 2017. For reference, Walmart had $3.7bn of
combined depreciation and amortization for its US segment during the most similar period (ending Jan. 31, 2018).
The impact of adding back whatever the depreciation is by itself is relatively pronounced on Amazon’s margins
considering that Walmart’s revenue base was three times larger than Amazon’s. While we don’t have allocations
of stock-based compensation expense to geographic territories post 1Q16, if we assumed that 2015 levels of
stock-based compensation for North America as a percentage of revenue held up in 2017, Amazon would have
recognized around $2.2bn in stock-based comp in the region. By contrast, across all of Walmart’s divisions, only
$626mm in stock-based compensation was recognized during the comparable period. Adding these non-cash
costs back to operating income allows us to calculate a 7.0% figure for Wal-Mart’s US region (vs. a 5.6% as-
reported operating income margin) and 8.2% for Amazon’s North America region (rather than a 2.7% as-reported
operating income margin). We think similar trends are at play internationally, with reported margins depressed by
the company’s accounting choices.
More generally, we think that Amazon will want to cap its retail profit margins in order to sustain its
competitive advantages and encourage more top-line growth. The company can theoretically squeeze its
suppliers, but if Amazon is too aggressive, manufacturers may alter their preferred mixes of first-party and third-
party online and offline retail channels and partners, and may more aggressively invest in business models which
encourage direct-to-consumer initiatives along the way. Critically, prices need to remain relatively low in order for
consumers to continue to prioritize buying from Amazon vs. competitors. Further, Amazon will want to continually
invest in physical / retail stores and will either choose or be forced to increase spending on labor and other social
goods given the company’s size and de facto social responsibilities. Higher costs from these sources will be at
least partially offset by growth in revenues from higher margin activities such as advertising (with very high
margins for O&O ad sales and lower, if still relatively-high margins for advertising on its ad network), the third-
party marketplace and an expanded focus on private label brands.
Put together, we would expect that Amazon’s non-AWS revenues will be able to hold up with higher-than-industry
average levels, with ongoing improvements as the aforementioned margin-enhancing activities (advertising, the
third-party marketplace, private label goods, etc.) account for a growing share of the company’s revenue base.
Our model assumes long-term as-reported operating income margins of 5%, up vs. the nearly 3% level we expect
the company to produce during calendar 2018.
From benchmarking AWS against its peers, we are comfortable assuming mid-30s operating income
margins for this segment. As AWS competes in relative isolation from the rest of the company, we think that the
business can be compared to margins we see in similar businesses within the software world. For reference,
during the last three fiscal years Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment (which houses the Azure business which
most directly competes with AWS) has had GAAP operating income margins ranging between 33% and 37%. As
- 6 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group

another example, Oracle’s margins have held relatively steady at 34% during the same time-frame. Adobe’s has
ranged lower, but is on an upswing rising from 26% in 2016 to 31% last year and we forecast it to be on pace
towards a high-30s range over the next few years. Salesforce.com is lower, sitting in the mid-single digits on a
GAAP basis, but will inevitably trend to a substantially higher level as the company matures (specifically, the
company anticipates an estimated 35% margin for its business at maturity). On this basis, we assume a mid-30s
margin level at maturity for AWS, up from 2017’s 25% level and the 28% we expect for 2018.
Taxes are low, but also likely face pressures over time. We assume a 25% rate in the long-run for Amazon
as we do for most of the companies in our coverage universe, despite significantly lower levels at
present. We expect taxes to generally rise for Amazon, as we do for all companies under our coverage over the
very long-term. For the foreseeable future we expect taxes to be reduced in large part because of the current
treatment of stock-based compensation (which probably reduces the company’s tax bill by around $1.5bn in
2018). At the same time, as evidenced by the company’s recent HQ2 contest, the company may very well be able
to play off various governments against each other to realize further savings that extend into the far-off future.
Nonetheless, we assume that over time taxes converge to a 25% level for Amazon.
VALUATION CONSIDERATIONS
The DCF we use to drive our valuation for Amazon attempts to calculate the company’s long-term cash-producing
capacity by beginning with unadjusted net income and adding back non-cash costs such as depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation, and some near-term adjustments for working capital. We deduct capital
for acquisitions and capital expenditures as reported, but also eliminate principal repayments of capital and
finance leases (given the company’s reliance on capital leases to fund a large share of its capex) in a manner
which essentially offsets the D&A add-back.
Our approach to determining Amazon’s cost of capital is identical to the approach we use for other companies
under our coverage, with one cost of capital for the near-term (through 2023) and a separate higher cost for
periods beyond 2023. We also use a variable to capture the relative desirability or lack of desirability of a given
sector or company (implicitly reflecting amplified or depressed flows of funds into a given stock). We are currently
using costs of capital of 11.4% for the long-run (8.3% in the short-term) that are identical to those we use for
Google, Salesforce, Adobe and Twitter, but lower than what we use for Facebook. Our long-term revenue growth
variable is +7.0%, which is similar to Adobe, slower than Salesforce and faster than Google and Facebook.

RISK FACTORS
We see the following among Amazon’s key risks:
• Regulation: The size of Amazon’s retail business has a meaningful impact on consumers, its competitors
and the societies in which they operate. To the extent that governments determine that they must cause
Amazon to behave differently, they could constrain the company’s growth opportunities or cause it to
incur additional costs.
• Competition: Competition is pervasive for Amazon, and so far in its history Amazon has navigated
through that competition in an incredibly successful manner. However, there are limited barriers to entry
in selling goods or otherwise replicating individual aspects of Amazon’s business. Over time, efforts by
manufacturers or other retailers to compete differently or otherwise alter the terms under which they work
together could have a negative effect on Amazon.
• General Economic Trends: In comparison with its status during the last recession, e-commerce is now a
much more mature business and Amazon a much large player. During the 2008-09 period, the company
was a tenth of its present size and e-commerce a relative blip of total retail spending. Consequently, we
could envision that a downturn in the overall economy might impact Amazon (and e-commerce more
generally) in a more meaningful way if one occurred at this point in time.

JPM: Spending More Money with No Apologies
Our Call Equity Analyst(s)
The main news from the 3Q21 earnings call is that JPM intends to continue its elevated Mike Mayo, CFA
pace of investment spend, meaning expense growth of est. 7% in 2021 and another 4% in Senior Equity Analyst | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
2022 (vs. only 2-3% in 2019-2020). Conceptually, JPM is using the windfall from record  | 212-214-5300
credit quality to fund investments in tech and other areas (branches, advisors, marketing). Christopher Spahr
JPM has the obligation to better spell out how these investments will achieve the desired Senior Equity Analyst | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC

and when spending is certain and payos uncertain. Nonetheless, even while absorbing Robert Rutschow
the extra spend, JPM still has est. core operating leverage that was at in 3Q21 YoY and Senior Equity Analyst | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
 | 212-214-5302
will turn positive in 2022. Indeed, after its last ""reset year"" in 2013, JPM showed favorable

We divide the bank story for JPM and the industry in 3 acts. The continuation of “Act
1” (credit, capital markets) is going stronger for longer. In 3Q21, credit losses were the Rating Overweight
lowest in its modern history (21bp, down 10bp QoQ); NPAs declined 9% QoQ. JPM Ticker JPM

levels. Price (10/12/2021) $165.36

strides given slight QoQ improvement and the absence of any change in guidance. Yet,

there are signs of progress. First, JPM intends to deploy more idle cash (est. $200bn-

Fourth, there’s slight card growth (less paydowns) and higher spend volume should

Large-Cap Banks Equity Research
3Q21 Summary
3Q21 Above. JPM reported 3Q21 EPS of $3.74 and adjusted EPS of $3.03 after excluding (a)
rmwide net credit reserve releases (52c) and (b) tax benets (19c). We estimate run-rate core EPS
of $3.22 (comparable to consensus of $3.00) after adjusting for (c) securities losses (est. 9c), (d) MSR
hedge loss (est. 4c), (e) legal expense (2c), and (f) est. reserve release already in consensus (est. 7c).
Flattish core operating leveage. Core revenue and expenses were up 4% YoY, and down 3% each QoQ.
Fees led the way YoY given good growth in IB and asset management. Specically, total trading was
down 5% YoY, which was better than Sept guidance (down 10%), led by strong results in equities (up
30% YoY; good share gains in prime), oset by weaker xed income (down 20%; lower spreads from
a strong 3Q20). IB was up up about 1/2 YoY, led by M&A, but ECM and DCM were up YoY as well.
Also, asset & wealth mgmt. grew well (+5% QoQ; +20% YoY). NII increased slightly QoQ ($13.1bn vs.
$12.9bn), which to us sets a bottom with a degree of inection point that can get debated. Credit
quality remains strong with record-low charge-os (21bp, down 10bp QoQ) and NPAs (down 9%
QoQ).
Guidance:
• NII: ~$52.5bn (unchanged) - implies 4Q21 managed NII of ~$13.5bn (given 3Q21 YTD managed
NII of $39bn) or up about 3% QoQ and 1% YoY
• Expenses: ~$71bn (unchanged) - implies 4Q21 adjusted expenses of ~$17.8bn (given 3Q21 YTD
adj. expenses of $53.2bn; excl. $0.3bn of YTD legal expense) or up about 4% QoQ and 10% YoY
• Card NCO: 2.0% (down from 2.5%) - implies 4Q21 NCO of 1.5% (given 2.2% 3Q21 YTD card NCO)
or up from 1.4% during 3Q21 and down from 2.2% during 4Q20

Tweaking iPhone Estimates Post Virtual Asia Trip
We are adjusting our iPhone estimates post virtual Asia trip. Supply chain check indicates
order trend is tracking ok with SE2 being stronger and iPhone 11 recovering gradually. As
expected, four models will be launched with 5G in 2H with 1-1.5 months of delay, of which
half are planned for 6.1” model with OLED but no LiDAR or triple camera. This seemed a bit
aggressive to us, considering there is another 5.4” iPhone 12 supposedly priced cheaper.
There is also increasing evidence of Apple taking aggressive effort to control BOM cost to
maintain margins given added features while still driving upgrades. We see Apple starting to
enlist LGD and BOE as OLED panel suppliers for the aforementioned higher volume 6.1”
model, with BOE offers very aggressive pricing of only $55 vs. around $80-100 for
Samsung’s panel. Our iPhone units are 3% and 5% lower for Jun-Q and Sep-Q to now 31M
and 39M, while Dec-Q is 3% higher at 73M due to shift of iPhone 12 timing by a month.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage
universe"").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"":

Valuation Methodology: We rate AAPL Equal Weight with a price target of $326. While many are excited about Services and Wearables, we
remain cautious on the core iPhone business amid high street expectation for 5G iPhone cycle. We believe EPS growth will come mostly from the

Barclays | Apple, Inc.
buyback. We are using a 15x EV/EBITDA and P/E multiple of 23x our FY 2021 EPS estimate of $14.24 to arrive at our $326 price target.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: 1) iPhone competition. Apple market share
peaked several years ago, and the company has not had a hit phone in a few years. Huawei has been taking high-end market share in China and
other emerging markets.
2) Installed base impact on Services. Services have been a great growth business, but if the installed base grows more slowly or starts to shrink, it
could materially affect this business.
3) Valuation. AAPL is trading at all time high in multiples despite little operating income growth, falling gross and operating margins, and share
losses in their core business.
4)Tariffs. A large portion of Apple products are manufactured in China, and incremental tariffs would make the iPhone more expensive in the
U.S. at a time when price elasticity has begun to hurt.

KO: KOming for 2022 with Momentum ... and Relative Cost Advantages — Raising Target
Our Call Equity Analyst(s)
KO Q421 results were ahead of expectations and momentum is building into 2022. Chris Carey
While true for some others too, KO looks unique: top-line momentum complemented Senior Equity Analyst | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
by a relatively advantaged cost structure, while a re-basing of investments in 2021 (ad  | 212-214-6059
spend up nearly 50%) means KO has ex to allow costs to track top-line momentum, or if Joe Lachky, CFA
needed dial back spend should the world change. Meanwhile, potential upside to volumes Associate Equity Analyst | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
(away-from-home recovery) and price/mix (given ination at bottlers) seem plausible  | 314-875-2042
through the year. Basically, KO is a 'ex to beat' story, not a 'stretch to meet'... and we like Marc Torrente, CFA, CPA
the setup for 2022. Overweight. Associate Equity Analyst | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
 | 314-875-2557
Raising estimates, target to $69 - a model with ex in 2022. We raise our 2022e EPS Evan Greenblatt
to $2.45 (was $2.42) with our 2023e EPS to $2.59 (was $2.56). We go through the key Associate Equity Analyst | Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
bridge math below, but the general idea here is that top-line momentum is accelerating  | 212-214-5310
into 2022 and despite some ination on commodities (+MSD impact to COGS), there's
still a lot of ex namely on SG&A, i.e. KO seems in a position to maintain high levels of Rating Overweight
investment while still comfortably delivering the EPS outlook. Our $69 target (was $67) is Ticker KO
on an unchanged 26.5x CY23e EPS, +40% vs SPX (historical +25% with ex to earnings). Price Target/Prior: $69.00/$67.00
Upside/(Downside) to Target 12.4%
REVENUE - bridge. We model 2022e organic sales +7.7%, with price/mix +4.5% and
Price (02/10/2022) $61.38
concentrate volumes +3.2%. Our sense is KO views comps more normal now after several
52 Week Range $48.97 - 62.32
years of volatility, i.e. rate of top-line growth should be fairly even through the year, with
Shares Outstanding 4,319,420,236
potentially some modest tailwind in Q1 from slightly easier underlying comps (albeit 1
Market Cap (MM) $265,126
less day in Q1 oset by 1 more day in Q4 is a consideration). Price/mix perspective. In our
Enterprise Value (MM) $294,092
global bottler deep-dive, we argued that bottler read-throughs implied pricing of ~5%
Average Daily Volume 17,549,788
looked reasonable so while Q421 price/mix was +10% (more about comps), we still think
Average Daily Value (MM) $1,077
+4-5% is a reasonable starting point (KO noting 2022 sales should be balanced between
Dividend (NTM) $1.70
price/mix and volume, albeit we skew more price/mix in our model).
Dividend Yield 2.8%
GROSS MARGIN - bridge - see Chart 1. The net of this is that we model GM down Net Debt (MM) - last reported $28,966
-35bps y/y (was +50bps) as we now fold in BodyArmor (-80bps impact at the mid- ROIC - Current year est. 16%
point). Our thinking on the bridge, which we lay out in detail in Chart 1, is as follows: 3 Yr EPS CAGR from current 10%
price/mix +175bps, channel mix (recovery of away-from-home) +95bps, commodities year (unless otherwise noted)
-200bps, FX -70bps, BodyArmor -80bps, with our model implying ~+50bps from all other
(productivity and volume leverage being positives for the story in 2022 - could be higher $ 2021A 2022E 2022E 2023E 2023E
in our view). This gets us to our 59.8% gross margin vs 60.1% in 2021. A comment on EPS Curr. Prior Curr. Prior
BodyArmor gross margins. KO disclosures for the Q4 impact from BA (-70bps to GM) Q1 (Mar) 0.55 A 0.58 E 0.59E 0.61 E NC
implies that GMs were negative on our math (included one-time items); however, at Q2 (Jun) 0.68 A 0.68 E 0.67E 0.72 E NC
70-90bps impact to 2022, this implies BA GMs at roughly 35% for 2022 (note: BA is seen Q3 (Sep) 0.65 A 0.69 E 0.67E 0.72 E NC
de minimis to 2022 EPS). Q4 (Dec) 0.45 A 0.51 E 0.48E 0.54 E NC
FY 2.32 A 2.45 E 2.42E 2.59 E 2.56E
OPEX - bridge. The idea here is that KO re-based its investment levels in 2021, essentially
P/E 26.4x 25.1x 23.7x
going into 2022 with a cleaner foundation. Some context: Q4 ad spend was up nearly
50%, putting the FY21 ad spend at just over $4.0bn, i.e. up nearly 50% y/y and down only Source: Company Data, Wells Fargo Securities estimates, and Renitiv.
NA = Not Available, Volatility = Historical trading volatility
modestly from 2019 levels. Selling and distribution expenses grew +LSD in Q4, by our
math ending the year at ~$2.6bn, -2% vs 2020. This implies that other expenses were up
about 35% in Q4 with the FY up ~23%. Big picture: KO's 2021 momentum allowed it to
return to more normal spending levels. For 2022, we model SG&A +$900mn, embedding
ad spend +9% (+$380mn y/y to 10.7% vs 10.6% in 2021) with other expenses ex-stock
comp +6% (+$440mn).

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage
universe"").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.
Below is the list of companies that constitute the ""industry coverage universe"":

Valuation Methodology: We rate AAPL Equal Weight with a price target of $136. While many are excited about Services and Wearables, we
remain cautious on high Street expectations for the 5G iPhone cycle. We believe EPS growth will come mostly from buybacks. Our $136 PT is
28 January 2021 11

Barclays | Apple, Inc.
based on a 30x P/E multiple on our CY21e EPS estimate of $4.52.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: 1) iPhone growth. Apple market share peaked
several years ago, and the company has not had a hit phone in a few years.5G iPhones could help AAPL regain share after Huawei sanctions, but
the hefty valuation already prices in a very successful iPhone 5G cycle, leading to more downside than upside risks.
2) Installed base impact on Services. Services have been a great growth business, but if the installed base grows more slowly or starts to shrink
the segment could be materially affected.
3) Valuation. AAPL is trading at all time high multiples despite little operating income growth, falling gross and operating margins, and share
losses in the core business.
4) Regulation. We expect to see increasing regulatory scrutiny on AAPL's practices in its App Store. Increasing regulation could lead to a change
in its business model, or lower cut from app developers.
Other Material Conflicts: One of the Research Analysts on the fundamental equity coverage team (and/or a member of his or her household)
has a long position in Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VGT) which primary holding is in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL).

Our Thoughts
While PEP shares are up just +1% YTD (in-line with the XLP), the stock continues to outperform other pure-play beverage
brand-owners such as KO (-11%) given lower exposure to the on-premise channel (just ~10% of sales globally) and a
more diversified portfolio (including breakfast and snacking, both of which have seen significant tailwinds over the crisis).
While we are largely on board with the notion that top line at PEP should prove relatively more stable than other
Beverage peers this year, we are below Consensus on earnings as we believe management’s bias will be to reinvest
behind long-term growth. With CEO Ramon Laguarta referencing a “zero based spending mindset” and stress tests to
“optimize” how capital is deployed on the 2Q earnings call, we would expect potential savings and the degree of flow-
through to the bottom line from this to be key topics of conversation on tomorrow’s call.
For 3Q in particular, we look for organic sales to be up +1.6%. We expect currency headwinds (+2.5%) to be fully offset
by tailwinds from M&A (+2.5%), bringing our all-in estimate for total company sales to up +1.6% for the quarter. In North
America, we expect growth to be led by Frito Lay (+5%) and Quaker (+6%) but note that we are expecting the strongest
sequential improvement in PBNA (-0.5% vs. -7% in 2Q) reflecting improved consumer mobility in the U.S. and its impact
on demand in the convenience and gas channel (which inflected back to growth in June following double-digit declines in
March). Look overseas, we expect growth to be led by Asia-Pacific (+6%), reflecting improved trends in China and India,
with Latin-America and Europe flattish and AMESA down -1%. On profitability, we look for gross margin to be down -30
bps including expansion in the base PEP business offset by dilution from acquired businesses (primarily Pioneer). We
model SG&A up +50 bps (vs. +200 bps in 2Q) including volume deleverage in the base PEP business, sequentially lower
PPE costs and the impact of lower SG&A in acquired businesses.
What Matters Most To Us
· Impact of COVID-19 on global consumption
· Incremental color on potential savings from new ways of working through the crisis and reinvestment plans to
support a recovery in markets emerging from the outbreak

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or
Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are
deemed to be in the same industry (“the industry coverage universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a
particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.

In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as
Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the
equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of
all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target:
Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's
expectation of where the stock will trade in the next 12 months. Upside/downside scenarios, where provided,
represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period.
Top Picks:
Barclays Equity Research's ""Top Picks"" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry
(as defined by the relevant ""industry coverage universe""), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that
industry. Barclays Equity Research publishes ""Top Picks"" reports every quarter and analysts may also publish intra-
quarter changes to their Top Picks, as necessary. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their
published research in addition to their Top Pick, there can only be one ""Top Pick"" for each industry. To view the current
list of Top Picks, go to the Top Picks page on Barclays Live (https://live.barcap.com/go/keyword/TopPicks).

Amazon.com, Inc. Equity Research
Price Target
Price Target: $3000 from $2725
Our valuation is based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis. Our $3,000 price target represents 23x 2021E
EV/EBITDA. Risks include ongoing investment in Amazon's infrastructure (both on the AWS and Retail
sides of the business), entries into new retail categories where Amazon is less experienced, competition
from traditional brick and mortar players, and challenges expanding into newer international markets
(such as India).
Investment Thesis
We remain confident on AMZN's ability to drive penetration of additional retail product categories and key
emerging geographies, maintain its lead in cloud computing and execute against additional opportunities
such as online advertising (across both endemic and non-endemic advertiser categories), which we believe
offer the company compelling growth and profit characteristics.
Company Description
Amazon.com, Inc. offers services to consumers, sellers, and developers through its retail websites. It also
manufactures and sells the Kindle e-reader. The Company offers programs that enable sellers to sell their
products on its websites and their own branded websites. Amazon.com serves developers through Amazon
Web Services (AWS), which provides access to technology infrastructure that developers can use to
enable any type of business. In addition, the Company generates revenue through co-branded credit card
agreements and other marketing and promotional services, such as online advertising. Amazon.com has
organized its operations into two principal segments: North America and International.

Our Thoughts
Down just -2% YTD (vs. XLP -7%), PEP has not seen the same investor exodus as other names across the beverage
universe by virtue of the company’s relatively lower exposure to disruption from social distancing in the on-premise
channel (just 10% of sales globally) and U.S. scanner data pointing to robust consumption across the Frito-Lay and
Quaker businesses in off-premise channels through the lockdown, even beyond the peak stockpiling period. In terms of
key topics for tomorrow, the impact of COVID-19 on company operations will be important. Additionally, following PEP’s
acquisition of Rockstar Energy (03/11/2020: CNBC: PepsiCo to Acquire energy drink maker Rockstar Energy in a $3.85bn
deal), we will also look for an update around the company’s strategy in the energy category.
For 1Q, we look for organic sales to be up +4% assuming on-premise sales are down -11% globally and off-premise sales
are up +6% reflecting the lockdown beginning in March. Scanner trends for FLNA reflect sales up +8% in 1Q. (vs. +5% in
2019) with the most recent 2WE 04/04 up +12% (vs. +37% in the 2W prior). Even more strikingly, Quaker is up +18% in
1Q (vs -1% in 2019) with the most recent 2W up +35% (vs. +94% in the 2W prior). Interestingly, while PBNA did benefit
from stockpiling towards the beginning of March, trends have slowed down a bit more recently perhaps by virtue of
larger pack sizes with longer replenishment cycles and/or a disproportionate hit to convenience store sales given lower
traffic in those channels. While sales for 1Q are up 6.5% (vs. +1% in 2019), the most recent 2W is up just +50 bps (vs.
+30% in the 2W prior). In terms of our model, in North America, we expect growth to be led by Quaker (+16.5%). We
look for FLNA to be up +3.5% and PBNA to be up +1.5% assuming headwinds to the on-premise channel as well as lower
foot traffic in untracked convenience stores. Internationally, we model headwinds from lockdowns/social distancing in
Europe (+5.5%) beginning in March and Asia-Pac/Australia/NZ/China (+2%) beginning in February. Outside of that, while
we expect AMESA (+8%) and Latin America (+6%) to be unimpacted in 1Q, we are modeling headwinds both businesses
beginning in 2Q. From a profitability standpoint, we model gross margins up +100 bps including volume leverage from
strong demand in March as well as a likely pull back in promotional activity over this period offset by heavier currency
headwinds. We look for SG&A to be up +100 bps reflecting continued reinvestment, higher distribution costs in the U.S.
in order to keep up with the velocity of sales at retail stores as well as the reversal of a 3c reinsurance related gain in
1Q19.
What Matters Most To Us

· Impact of COVID-19 on consumption for snacks, Quaker and beverages
· Strategy in energy category especially with regards to media reports around Bang Energy
· Updates to 2020 outlook including currency headwinds to top-line and profitability and reinvestment plans
· Raw material supply especially with regards to CO2
Guidance Recap
---- 2020 ----
· Core EPS $5.88 (+7% constant currency EPS growth and a -1% headwind from currency)
· Organic sales growth +4%
· FX impact sales -1%
· Tax rate approximately 21 percent
· Operating cash flow ~$11 billion
· CapEx ~5 billion
· Free cash flow ~$6 billion
· Dividends ~$5.5 billion
· Share repurchases ~$2 billion
---- Long Term Guidance ----
· 4% to 6% organic revenue growth
· Operating margin +20 to 30 bps expansion per year
· Core constant currency EPS growth to be in the high single digits
· Productivity of at least $1 billion annually through 2023
· Core net ROIC increasing
· CapEx to moderate and to return to approximately 5% of revenue by 2022

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or
Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are

deemed to be in the same industry (“the industry coverage universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a
particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as
Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the
equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of
all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target:
Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's
expectation of where the stock will trade in the next 12 months. Upside/downside scenarios, where provided,
represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period.
Top Picks:
Barclays Equity Research's ""Top Picks"" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry
(as defined by the relevant ""industry coverage universe""), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that
industry. Barclays Equity Research publishes ""Top Picks"" reports every quarter and analysts may also publish intra-
quarter changes to their Top Picks, as necessary. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their
published research in addition to their Top Pick, there can only be one ""Top Pick"" for each industry. To view the current
list of Top Picks, go to the Top Picks page on Barclays Live (https://live.barcap.com/go/keyword/TopPicks).

Our Thoughts
KO trading activity has been volatile since 3Q earnings with shares trading up at the end of 2020 as investors began to
rotate into last year’s laggard/re-opening plays but peeling back gains in early January given perceived risks to Street
earnings estimates for 2021. To this point, positive news around vaccine development and an improving currency
environment have more recently been overshadowed by new lockdowns/restrictions on travel across Europe that are
likely to slow the company’s top-line recovery in 1H21. Additionally, a negative ruling from the IRS around a tax
settlement (resulting in a tax liability of ~$3 billion) has created incremental uncertainty around the impact to company
financials should KO’s efforts to dispute it prove unsuccessful, with concerns including a much higher multi-year liability
and the go-forward tax rate. At $49, we do believe that the worst-case scenario for how the ruling might play out is now
fully baked into shares (01/07/21: Breaking Down the Tax Dispute). With this as background, on earnings day, we expect
near-term commentary around unit case volumes (exit rates in December and early trends in January) and 2021
guidance (inclusive of any tax implications) to prove critical to the stock. While we recognize that KO’s road to recovery
may prove bumpy, we remain positive on the longer-term transformation underway at the company and the degree to
which it might unlock material improvements to revenue growth and profitability over time (10/08/20: Institutionalizing
the Change, 10.28/20: Management Meeting Tidbits). Additionally, having entered 2020 with positive momentum, we
have even more conviction that KO should emerge from the pandemic stronger as consumption behaviour across Staples
settles into its new normal (01/04/21: 21 for 2021).
For 2021, we continue to look for organic sales to be up ~9% with the two-year stack evening out in 3Q reflecting recent
developments in Europe net of a faster recovery in Asia-Pacific. Here we note positive commentary from management on
China at a recent competitor conference (“targeting growth exiting 2020 and into 2021”) and also virus progression in
ANZ. For 4Q20, we model organic sales growth down -2% inclusive of a ~200 bps benefit from two extra selling days.
What Matters Most To Us
· Unit case volume exit rates in 4Q and trends in January
· 2021 guidance inclusive of any tax implications
· Balance of reinvestment vs. earnings delivery as KO looks to support a recovery in its markets in 2021
· Discussion of organizational structure changes and the potential benefits they might yield longer term

Guidance Recap
---- 4Q20 ----
· Currency: 3% headwind to revenues and 9% headwind to operating profit including the impact of hedged
positions
---- 2020 ----
· Currency: 3% headwind to revenues and 6% headwind to operating profit including the impact of hedged
positions
· Tax Rate: 19.5%

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or
Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are
deemed to be in the same industry (“the industry coverage universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a
particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as
Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the

equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of
all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target:
Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's
expectation of where the stock will trade in the next 12 months. Upside/downside scenarios, where provided,
represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period.
Top Picks:
Barclays Equity Research's ""Top Picks"" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry
(as defined by the relevant ""industry coverage universe""), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that
industry. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their published research in addition to their
Top Pick, there can only be one ""Top Pick"" for each industry. To view the current list of Top Picks, go to the Top Picks

WMT called out a solid start to BTS, consistent with our preview and recent note BloombergJPMA HORVERS <GO>
citing a strong end of July for both WMT and TGT. WMT also called out Megan Alexander, CFA
ongoing strength in pet (lateral to TSCO), driven by inflation as well as autoparts. (1-212) 622-6457

cost pressures, including fuel and ecommerce fulfillment, category mix shifts

EPS down 9 -11%(or ~$1.31 at the midpoint vs. the Street’s $1.27).
Negative BJ lateral. Using the three-year CAGR trend from Sam’s indicates a
~5.5% for BJ, slightly below our raised estimate and below the low end of the 6-
8% expectation range we cited in our preview (based on our conversations). The
margin performance is likely to concern the bulls with Sam’s gross margin down
272 bps (related to higher supply chain costs, inflation, and elevated markdowns
caused by inventory delays, in addition to a 56-bp LIFO charge). Gas profitability
added 20 bps to GM.

Price Target
Price Target: $130 from NC
Our $130 price target reflects 25x our NTM earnings estimate. We see numerous upside and downside
risks to our Equal Weight rating/target. 1.) Continued progress in digital could earn greater credibility
with investors and a higher valuation. 2.) International divestitures would be positive for returns and the
stock. 3.) Traffic and comps could slow as in-store initiatives mature, putting pressure on the stock.
4.) Margins could fall by more than expected if digital losses grow, competition intensifies, and costs rise.
Investment Thesis
WMT has made strong progress in its repositioning against high initial skepticism, and the pace of change
should be applauded. The company has essentially turned itself into Amazon's biggest on-line retail
competitor while returning its stores to positive traffic growth. We have been impressed with the effort,
but simply cannot get behind the stock after its recent run given that structural issues still loom large. E-
commerce risk is shifting to food/consumables, hard discount poses a threat, traditional competitors are
beginning to fight harder, and the cost of doing business in retail continues to rise. We also find it difficult
to ignore the fact that WMT still operates 700 million sq. ft. of selling space (3x its closest peer) at a time
when retail is under siege, and is the country's largest grocery store during the most challenging period in
the industry's history. As we assess the company's progress against our concerns and the stock's
improved valuation, the risk/reward appears balanced at current levels.

not as cheap as the underperformance would indicate (currently trading at

should improve its business model, we think investors need to see a return to
earnings growth to become more positive. Our Dec-17 price target is$43, based
on 22.5x our '18 estimate, in line with the current multiple. We see limited
upside to the current multiple and think any stock price appreciation will likely
come as a result of earnings growth.

Investment Thesis
Coca-Cola Company In the Right Direction
(KO) We believe that the steps Coke is taking should helpturn their business around
longerterm, but we expect earnings to remain somewhat underwhelming over the
Neutral
next two years. We expect KO to resume growth only in 2019, and as a result, we
believe the stock will continue to trade sideways. We think investors can be patient at
this point in time.
Sometimes Change Takes Longer to Show inResults
In our view, whenCoke acquired CCE's North American bottling assets in 2010 it
was clear that the company had a long-term vision as to what their optimal business
structure would look like. Over the past four years, the company hasbeenthrough
several iterations of refranchising both in the US and internationally, with the long
process expected to come to anendthis year. The refranchising should create a
leaner, more nimble structureand should result inhigher margins and greater returns,
but it has taken longer to showin the company's actual results, which we believe has
disappointed investors. We recognize that the company has faced a number of
headwinds that are not specific to Coke (FX, weak macros, etc.) and some that are
more one time in nature (bottling divestitures), but the lack of earnings growth has
kept the stock range bound over the past several years.
Total Beverage Focus Makes Sense, but Portfolio Still Skews Towards CSDs
During the recent CAGNY 2017 conference, management provided a more detailed
plan on how they expectto deliver outsized beverage category growth in the coming
years through growth in both stills and sparkling portfolios. Although Coke has
always been a total beverage company, theprimary focus hadbeen on itslargest
segment:CSDs(70% of total companyrevenues)until most recently. In our view,
there was a much greater sense of urgency to not only capture growth from the faster
growing stills categories, but also re-package (smaller pack sizes) and reformulate
some of their current CSD offerings to meetconsumer preferences. This focus on
CSDs, in our view,will make it more challenging for the company to deliverontheir
long-term organic revenue growth target of +4-6%.
Earnings Growth Challenged Through 2018…
We think investors have become increasingly disappointed with the lack of earnings
growth over the past few years. In reality, the company has not delivered earnings
growth since 2013 and we believe that2017 EPS will likely end up being below the
$1.92 number the company delivered in 2011. With structural changes and currency
headwinds still expected to adversely affect earningsover the next two years, it is
tough for us to see how KO will be able to deliver outsized earnings growth vs. other
large-cap multi-national peers until 2019.
… With Signs of Greener Pastures Ahead, but Not Until 2019
We see Coke’sstock asstill expensive despite the underperformance (see below) and
expect earnings growth tobe at the low end of the peer range. However, we do think
that as we exit 2017 and move through 2018andthe company's path to earnings
acceleration becomes clearer,investors will begin to see how the company's changes
are beginning to bear fruit and drive outsized growth for the future. We would also
not rule out the potential for new CEO James Quincey to announce a large cost


Andrea Teixeira, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622-6735 21 March 2017

savingsprogram (which he hinted at during CAGNY), which we think would be a
significant catalyst to get the stock moving higher.
Stock Still Does NotLookCheap
Over the past three years, KO has underperformed both the market and the XLP by
26%, respectively. The stock's underperformance has largely been driven bynegative
earnings revisions and the stock is not as cheap as the underperformance may
indicate, in our view. KO is trading at roughly 22x our NTM estimate, which is
generally inline with where the stock has traded historically. We see limited upside
to the current multiple and think any stock price appreciation will likely come as a
result of earnings growth.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
Concerns Around Health and Wellness
As the US and global consumer becomes more focused on health and wellness, this
may negatively impact the company's revenue growth, particularly the higher calorie
sugar offerings. We do think the company will be able to offset some of the negative
impact from a more health conscious consumer through product innovation, smaller
pack sizes, reformulating certain products to lower the sugar content, and using more
natural ingredients.
Potential Taxes on Sugary Beverages
On top of the consumer concerns, we have seen a number of countries as well as
local municipalities in the United States enact a tax on sugary beverages. We believe
that each separate tax on the company's business will be determined on a case by
case basis, but that on average, as these taxes are passed on to the consumer, this
could impact demand. We would also point out that with a greater number of these
taxes being implemented (United Kingdom coming in 2018 and recently
implemented in Philadelphia in January 2017), we think there is an increased threat
that more cities and or countries look to implement these taxes to help curb the
obesity epidemic or raise funding.
Fx Volatility
Approximately 53% of The Coca-Cola Company’s 2016 revenues came from outside
the United States. Similar to other companies in our coverageuniverse, currency has
been a significant headwind for both revenue and earnings growth over the past few
years. Given the volatility we continue to see around the globe, we think currency
volatility will likely remain an issue. Any strengthening or weakening in the dollar
could result in downside or upside to our forecasts
Emerging and Developed Markets
KO has significant exposure to a number of emerging and developing markets
around the globe.Over the years the company has had a number of tailwinds and
headwinds as related to the performance of these markets. We believe that if
emerging market trends were to improve, this could lead to upside to company
results. On the contrary, if emerging market trends were to deteriorate further, this
could add pressure to the company's revenue and earnings performance.

Company Description
The Coca-Cola Company (KO, Coke) owns or licenses and markets over 500
nonalcoholic beverage brands, 3,800 beverage products of which 1,100 havelow or
no calories (as of FY15). Among top brands, 20 generate$1 billion in revenues or
above, including 14 still brands. Ofthe total revenues in 2016, 40% is concentrate,
and 60% is finished product. Trademark Coca-Cola represented 42%/45% of
volumes in US/globally, respectively,in FY16. The U.S. represented 19% of the total
volumes in 2016, but 48% of total revenues. Of U.S. beverage volumes, 66% was
sparkling and 34% was still.Mexico, Brazil, China and Japan combined represented
31% of volumes in 2016. Of the international volumes, 73% wassparkling
beverages. KO is undertaking a re-franchising of the US bottling system, which aims
to reach 100% of U.S. volumes by the end of 2017.

It Takes a Village, a Global One
Bottler Refranchising Has Taken Longer to Bear Fruit
Reducing complexity and investing in the core business has been one of the major
themes that have emerged in the CPG space over the past several years. Typically,
we think investorsappreciate these turnaround stories, as we believe that focusing on
cost cutting and reinvesting back into the business to generate top line growth have
allowed companies to generate greater value to shareholders over time.
However, in the case of the Coca-Cola Company, this process has taken longer than
its peers to show in actual results,as the company hashadto deal with numerous
(~250) bottling partners across the globe, some family owned, that have different
incentives. In comparison, it took P&G about five fiscal years to show results, while
KOhas alreadyclockedseven years, and we believe will likely take 8-9years (2018
or 2019) to show financial results. The transformation started about 8 years ago,
when the 2020 plan was announcedin 2009.The acquisitionin 2010of the U.S.
bottling territories was thefirst real step in that process. KO acquired the U.S.
bottling business of Coca Cola Enterprises (CCE), which is now known as Coca-
Cola Refreshments (CCR), to better align incentives of perpetual agreements, some
ofwhich did not have performance clauses. Three years later (2013), The Coca-Cola
Company announced the initial stagesofthe re-franchising, which didn’t begin until
2014. Management guided that this process will be finalized by the end of 2017,
which would mark a total of seven years of transition.

Source: Company Reports
Nearly Half of Global Volumes Will Be Refranchised
KO initially acquired the majority of U.S. territories as some contracts were
perpetual and there was limited accountability forperformance. Since then, KO has
realized that bottling was distracting the company from its core business
(concentrate), whichoffers a much higher margin and return.
Anchor Bottlers Facilitate Refranchisingand Strengthen Trade Execution
In addition, there has been a wave of bottling partners consolidatingworldwide,
whichtendsto create large bottlers that are more capitalized to invest more back into
the businessand providebetter trade execution. As such, KO can count on partners
that have proven track recordsof operating these businesses, and therefore can
continue to foster combinations where there is fit. 2016 marked a very strong year for
KO’s refranchising efforts,not only in the U.S.,but globally. By the end of this
process in4Q17, about 40% of the business will have changed leadership, at
least partially.

Global Concentration of Bottlers Is Net Positive to KO
Eighty-one percent ofCoke’svolumes aresold outside the United States. Bottling
partners that are financially strong and have aligned interests aretherefore crucial to
grow and improve profitability of the system. Following the consolidation of bottlers
in Germany in 2008, in Latin America over the past decade, and most recently in
Japan and China, we should continue to see more concentration of volumes in the
hands of fewer partners. The top 5 bottlers by volume as of 2015 were (in order of
size): Coca Cola Femsa, Coca Cola HBC, Arca Continental (AC), CCEP, Coca Cola
Icecek. These five bottlers contributed 39%of the total unit case volume in 2016, up
from 34%in 2015, and we believe this number will continue to expand, as both KOF
and AC have announced additional deals in Latin America and the United States (in
the case of ACBebidas). Having covered bottling partners in the past, our
experience is that having higher scale and contiguous territories are both crucial for
profitability and marketing reinvestment in the business.
AC’s Mexico Execution Is a Good Proxy for South U.S. Trends
Going forward, we believe that Arca's experiencein further expanding sales in
Northern Mexico (which already had a high consumption per capita of KO products)
will be instrumental ingrowingrevenues in the new U.S. territories,according to the
M.O.U. signed on May 25, 2016, which included Texas, parts of Oklahoma, New
Mexico and Arkansas. Also, The Coca-Cola Companyand KOF signed a new
concentrate agreement post the 10-year anniversary of the past contract. Both the
joint venture with AC* for the refranchisingin the U.S., and the new concentrate
agreement with KOF will be effective beginning July 2017.AC Bebidas’sexperience
with complex 1 million POS throughout LatAm shouldbe instrumental to its ability
to drive value per UC in Texas and adjacent new territories, as it executes the
acquisition in the U.S.
U.S. Refranchising Is c70% Arranged and Should Be Finalizedby End of 2017
So far, 70% of U.S volumes are already under new agreements (either definite
agreements or signed lettersof intent to refranchise bottling territories). The
company-owned operations handled 82% of the U.S. unit case volume as of FY15.
CCR accounts for about 70% of KO's volumes in the U. KO still controls CCR, the
largest bottler in the U.S. after the acquisition in 2010 from CCE. Most of CCR
assets are booked under assets for sale. In terms of divisional results, they arebooked
under Bottling Investments Group (BIG).

Bottler Consolidation in the U.S.Has Occurred Over Time
Historically, KO fostered consolidation of bottlers both in the U.S. and abroad. In the
U.S., this consolidation has accelerated in the last three decades. As a result, the
large multi-franchise operations (MFOs) eventually grew to control most of the U.S.
geography, while a number of single franchise operations (SFOs) declined. The first
modern Coke Territory map published by Beverage Digest in September 1983
showed 60 MFOs and more than 100 SFOs. The latest Coke territory map published
by Beverage Digestin September 2016 shows 17 MFOs (including CCR) and 48
SFOs. Besides owning 100% of CCR, KO also owns 30% of Coke Consolidated, the
second largest U.S. bottler. Together, CCR and Consolidated accounted for more
than 70% ofU.S. unit case volumes, as of late.

Refranchising Payments to KO Typically Based on Gross Profit
As part of the new beverage partnership model for North America, KO has entered
into the so-called “comprehensive beverage agreements -or CBAs” with certain
bottling partners, in which KO granted to these bottlers certain exclusive territory
rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing, and sale of the company-owned and
licensed products as defined by the CBA. If a bottler has not entered into a specific
manufacturing agreement, CCR retains the right to produce these products, and the
bottlers will purchase from CCR or other company-authorized bottlers. Each CBA
generally has a term of 10 years. Under the CBA, each bottler will make ongoing
quarterly payments to CCR based on its gross profit in the refranchised territories
throughout the term of the CBA, including renewals, in exchange for the grant of the
exclusive territory rights.
Latin America Powerhouse Bottlers KOF and AC Continue to Consolidate
In Latin America, KO signed a new concentrate agreement with KOF, and also
signed a letter of intent (link) for a Joint Venture with Arca Continental. This
contract is different from other bottler refranchising agreementsin which KO will
actually retain a stake in the company, rather than just fully refranchise. KO will own
a 20% stake in AC Beverages, a new company to be formed, that will include both
the LatAm and U.S. operations. As a reminder, AC is one of the top 5 bottlers in the
KO system, and KO did not have a direct ownership, contrary to the other four, all of
which KO has a minority stake,ranging from 20% in Icecek, 24% in Hellenic, and
28% in KOF. We believe this will better align KO’sinterests with AC,which is one
of the five largest KObottlersworldwide, in particular after AC bought Peruvian
bottler Lindley, in which KO had a minority stake.

In Europe, Middle East and Africa, ABI-SABM Merger Triggered More M&A
Two major deals were announced in the newly created Europe, Middle East and
Africa division (combining Western Europe and EMEA). Most recently, on
December 21,2016, KO decided to exercise its right of first refusal for Coca-Cola
Beverages Africa. KO and ABI have reached an agreement regarding the transition
of AB InBev’s 54.5% equity stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (“CCBA”) for
$3.15bn after customary adjustments. CCBA includes the countries of South Africa,
Namibia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Ghana, Mayotte and
Comoros. In addition, the companies have reached an agreement in principle for
Coke to acquire ABI’s interest in bottling operations in Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, El Salvador and Honduras for an undisclosed
amount.The transactions are subject to the relevant regulatory and minority
approvals and are expected to close by the end of 2017. This deal was preceded by
the negotiation, in November 2014, among three parties, including The Coca-Cola
Company,SAB Miller plc, and Gutsche Family Investments. The three entities
entered into an agreement to combine the bottling operations of each of the parties'
nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage businesses in Southern and East Africa. Upon
the completion of these two deals, KOwill have an ownership of 68% ofthe bottler,
which will be called Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Limited.KO plans to hold all of
these territories temporarily until they can be refranchised to other partners. The
company’s intent is to account for the acquired stakes as a discontinued operation for
reporting purposes.
CCEP –Emergence ofOne ofthe Largest Bottlersin the System Worldwide
The other main deal happened in August 2015, when the company entered into an
agreement to merge itsGerman bottling operations with Coca-ColaEnterprises, Inc.
(CCE) and Coca-Cola Iberian Partners SA (CCIP) to create Coca-Cola European
Partners (CCEP). At closing, KOwill own 18%of CCEP, which the company
expects toaccount for as an equity method investment based on the company’s
equity ownership percentage, itsrepresentation on CCEP's board of directors and
other governance rights. The boardsof directors of the company, CCE and CCIP
have approved the transaction. The proposed merger is subject to approval by CCE's
shareowners, receipt of regulatory clearances and other customary conditions. The
merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016. As a result of this
agreement, the company’sGerman bottling operations met the criteria to be
classified as held for sale as ofDecember31, 2015. The company wasnot required to
record the related assets and liabilities at fair value less any costs to sell because their
fair value exceeded the company’scarrying value.
In Asia Pacific, Both Japan and China Bottlers Are Consolidating
The company also announced that it hasentered into a non-binding letter of intent to
refranchise company-owned bottling operations in China to two of its existing
bottling partners –COFCO and Swire. In July 2016, the company-owned bottling
operationsin China and a related cost method investment met the criteria to be
classified as held for sale. KO has not been required to record these assets and
liabilities at fair value less any costs to sell because their fair value approximates the
carrying value. Management guided for the closing of this merger by end of 2017.
In Japan, Coca Cola West and Coca Cola East Japan also agreed to merge and the
deal is expected to close by 1Q17. KO has an equity investment in Coca Cola East
Japan booked at $562mn value but estimated at a fair value of $845mn.

Impact to Numbers
In the earnings section of this initiation, we discuss the impact of the refranchising in
more detail. There, we detailour estimates over the course of 2017 and 2018. There
are a number of moving parts as it relates to the refranchising, but we estimate that
the company's revenue base will drop by roughly 18-19% over the next two years,
with gross and operating marginsmoving up nicely. Although some refranchising
has occurred already, we believethat most of the benefit on the margin lines will
start showing up over the course of the next two years.
In the diagram below, KO providesa framework to understand the impact on main
accounts if the refranchising of the announced deals had happened in full in 2016, on
a pro-forma basis. As we can see below, the main positive impact wouldbe an
increase in FCF margin, a 900bps boost to operating margin (driven by 800bps of
gross margin) and a $1bn reduction in capex. The actual impact shoulddiffer as more
deals will likely be announced by then and normal course of business (growth, FX,
price/mix, inflation, etc.) will play a role in actual results.

Top Line Algorithm
Total Beverage Focus Doesn’t Fix CSD Mix Issue
With the CSD category facing a number of evolving headwinds both from category
fragmentationandincreased health and wellness concernsin developed markets, we
have seen The Coca-Cola Company transform their approach to how they think about
revenue growth as well as their overall beverage portfolio. For historical context, the
company was previouslyheavily volume focused and given their portfolio mix
(which over-indexes towards CSDs), we believe wasoverly concerned about driving
volume growth within CSDs. Given the category headwinds, to drive volume
growth, KO (as well as other major players) became very competitive on the pricing
front, which ultimately ended up hurting the profit pool.
During the second quarter of 2014, we believe there was clearly a shift in the mindset
of a number of large CSD manufacturers in the United States. While the category
continued to face a number of changes from a consumer standpoint (namely artificial
sweeteners and health/wellness), lower pricing was no longer driving the incremental
volume growth the category had seen in years past. Therefore,to improve the overall


Andrea Teixeira, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622-6735 21 March 2017

profitability of the category the large manufacturers became more focused on using
price to drive an improvement in revenue and profitability trends.
At the CAGNY conference last month, new CEO James Quincey talked about the
company's new strategy to become a total beverage company, highlighting that this
would be the last time investors would hear him say the words “sparkling and stills”.
In our view, we think focusing on the total portfolio makes senseand was
encouragedhearinga greater emphasis (and urgency,in our view) outside of the core
CSD franchise.The company plans to capture continued growth through at-home
innovation, expanding successful brands to international markets, and through
potential small tuck-in M&A, which they hope to create into much larger brands
down the road. On the sparkling side, the company hopes to continue to grow with
their core through solid marketing. Also, thoughtful innovation around their core
CSD brands both inside (reduced sugar intake, product reformulations) and outside
(drive smaller pack sizes and downsizeselect single-serve packs)will be crucial to
deliveringthis plan. Our concern regarding the company’s top linealgorithm (which
calls for +4-6% organic revenue growth longer-term) is that while the company has
limited direct exposure to some of these smaller, faster growing categories both in
the U.S.and globally, the company's portfolio mix still skews too far in the direction,
in our view,towards CSDs. Said another way, if the global Beverage category is
expected to grow +4% in the coming years (according to KO's CAGNY
presentation), and roughly 70% of the company's revenue mix comes from the slower
growing CSDs, it is tough to see how the high end of the company's LT revenue
algorithmis sustainable.
We believethecompany’s geographic breadth (65% of revenues outside the US
when refranchising is complete) and global bottling network will likely allow the
company to continue to gain share ofthe categories in which itcompetes. However,
we remain concerned that the company's current portfolio mix may be disadvantaged
longerterm and as these emerging markets begin to mature and the beverage
category continues to fragment,delivering organic revenue withinthe long-term
algorithm may prove to be more difficult as we believe CSDs are inherently going to
grow below the NARTD category average.
As we look ahead, we think it is clear that management is being thoughtful about the
company’s portfolioand there has been a greater sense of urgency toaccelerate the
diversification both within sparkling and in additional categories. That said, we think
the company has been somewhat hesitant to undertake large scale M&A and
although ithas made strategic equity investments, which provide some benefit to the
P&L on an earnings basis, they have notprovidedthe coveted top line growth that
has become harder to come by within CPG.
Putting this all together, we believe that KO's organic revenue growth will likely
remain at the low end (or potentially below, which the company guided to in ‘17) of
their long-term organic revenue target of +4-6% in the coming years.
Growth in Non-CSDs
As mentioned above, the company is focusing on drivinggrowth and capturing their
share of the non-carbonated beverage categories that are growing above the category
average. The company highlighted a number of key categories in which they
currently have 10-15% market shares and are looking to not only benefit from strong


Andrea Teixeira, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622-6735 21 March 2017

category growth, but hope to gain greater share of these categories, particularly at the
high end. Management stated that they hope to drive growth and gain share through:
at home innovation, accelerated scaling of the ones that are working, and make
investments/smaller acquisitions to producemore opportunities down the road.
At Home Innovation
The company highlighted that in order to benefit from these faster growing
categories they will continue to innovate locally. Of the 21 billion dollar brands that
the company owns, management highlighted that roughly 75% of these brands were
home grown. Some primary examples include: Gold Peak Tea, Fuze Tea, Simply,
and Ice Dew (water in China).

After launching roughly 500+ new products in 2016, another 500+ new products are
currently in the pipeline and planned for launch in 2017. As we look at the different
ways that the company is planningto capture growth, we think this would likely be
the preferred route of investors as it is the cheapest of the three options, but, in our
view,has the greatest room for error. It typically takes significant time for new
brands to get to a point where they are big enough to move the needle for the overall
company, which management highlighted recently saying that it can take up to 10
years to build a billion dollar brand (which we thinkwould be something that would
be big enough to move the needle).
Accelerating Scale of Successful Brands
In addition to at-home innovation, the company is looking to accelerate the pace at
which they take brands that are very successful in their homemarket and launch
them in different markets. One of the more recent successful launches was
Smartwater into Great Britain in 2014, which has seen rapid success in the market.

the Honest brand to additional markets internationally.
M&A: Both through Investments and Small Tuck-Ins
The company has made some small strategic tuck-in acquisitions as well as equity
investments in recent years. We believethat the company has been somewhat
skeptical about large-scale M&A and prefers tomake equity investments to benefit
from the growth. It started in early 2014, when ittook a 20% stake in Green
Mountain Coffee Roaster (this has since been exited as a result of JBH’s acquisition
of GMCR), and this was followed by an equity stake in Monster Beverage.
Although these investments doprovide a boost to earnings, they do not provide the
incremental top line growth thatwe believehas become coveted by investors. One of
the key reasons why Coke says that taking equity investments is the right choice is
often times large-scale M&A fails as the smaller brand gets lost in a larger
company's vast network. Investing in these specific companiesallows thesebrands to
maintain thefocus that has made them successful in the first place.
Looking ahead, we think that KO will likely continue to do small tuck-in acquisitions
with the potential for additional M&A down the road. The company hashighlighted
that they are taking their Venture Emerging Brands (VEB) concept and moving it
into international markets. As it relates to M&A, we do think any potential deals will
likely remain smaller in size, particularly given the company's commentary at
CAGNY,stating,“Of course, we're going to continue to look for small bolt-on
M&As. M&A is like everything else in life: the bigger it gets, the fewer there are and
the much more episodic those things become. So the most likely outlook is similar to
what it has been in the past in the sense that we will do the majority of transactions
we do willbe small bolt-on ones that we will aim to grow in their home country or
region and through global expansion.”

How Is Coke Thinking about CSDs Going Forward?
It comes as no surpriseto usthat CSDs have been challenged in developed markets
due to secular reasons, but the category is still showing increased penetration in
developing markets, such as India and South Africa, whereper capita consumption is
low. Globally, Coca Cola has about 51% market share of global CSDs,more than
double PepsiCo's share of 20%.

Although there has been a greater sense of urgency to transform the total company
portfolio towards the faster growing stills categories, as of 2016, 72% of total
company volume was carbonated soft drinks (which we estimate means that roughly
75% of '16 total company revenues came from sparkling beverages; we note that post
refranchising in North America,the company's segment mix will shift more towards
stillsasKO will be selling full revenue non-carbcases vs. simply CSD concentrates).
At the end of theday, in order to hit the company's long-term organic revenue target
of +4-6%, the company needs to drive some growth from their CSD business. As we
look ahead we think KO's performance in the sparkling segment will be driven by the
following factors:
1.) Shifting the equation as it relates to price/mix and volume. Greater
price/mix vs. volume in developed markets vs. more volume in emerging
markets.
2.) Package innovation: Driving Smaller pack sizes and downsizing select
single-serve packs.
3.) Product reformulationand focusing on reducing sugar within products.
Shifting the equation: Emerging Markets Growth Expected to Continue
Although carbonated soft drinks shouldremain challenged in key developed markets
such as the United States, the global CSD category is stillexpected to grow in the
LSD range as a result of growth in emerging markets. Over the next few years,
carbonated soft drink volume is expected to grow in the +2-3% per year through
2020, while volume in developed markets shouldremain under pressure. Volatility in
a number of key emerging markets shouldremain an issue, but generally speaking,
we believe that exposure to emerging markets will be an important driver of organic
growth for the CSD category in the coming years.

Shifting the Equation: Developed Markets
One of the more welcomed changes that have occurred in the CSD category,
particularly in the US, over the past couple of years has been the industry’s rational
pricing environment. During the second quarter of 2014, we believe there was clearly
a shift in the mindset of a number of large CSD manufacturers in the United States.
Historically, the category was generally more focused on volume growth/share vs.
total revenue growth/share. While there werea number of changes going on from a
consumer standpoint in the CSD category (namely,artificial sweeteners and
health/wellness), lower pricing was no longer driving the incremental volume growth
the category had seen in years past. Therefore,to improve the overall profitability of
the category the largemanufacturers became more focused on using price to drive an
improvement in revenue trends. In addition to being rational on pricing, the category
has benefited from package innovation, as the companies are now offering smaller
pack sizes and on-the-go offerings, which provide mix benefits as they typically sell
at higher prices per ounce (more detail below).

Package Innovation
As mentioned above, the company’smindset within CSDs hasshifted towards total
revenuegrowth over the past few years. Although we believe rational pricing has led
to improvement on the pricing front, the company has used package innovation to
help benefit the on-the-go occasion as well as provide consumers with a greater focus
onportion control, less sugar, natural ingredients, and alternative choices. To that
end, KO has been launching smaller packages and more on-the-occasion, which have
become a much larger piece of the portfolio in recent years.

Although about 2/3 of carbonated soft drink volumes in the U.S. are either in multi-
serve presentations (i.e. 2L PET bottle) or larger pack of cans (12-pack of 12oz
cans), a large piece of the growth in the CSD category has been coming from these
smaller pack occasions. As you can see from the chart below, smaller package
options (which we define at this point in time as 1.25L PET, 8.5 ounce aluminum
bottle, 7.5 ounce cans, 8 ounce bottles, 12 ounce glass bottles, and 0.5 L PET) have
significantly outpaced the growth of the overall CSD category in the Nielsen xAOC

Product Innovation:Reducing Sugar and Product Reformulation
Outside of package innovation, Coke made it clear that they are looking to
reformulate certain beverages and are looking to reduce the sugar content across the
board. The company is currently relaunching and expanding Coca-Cola Zero Sugar
internationally.KOhas a number of programs and projects aimed at reducing the
amount of sugar in the core formulas while maintaining taste. Management stated
that this process is still in the early inningsand there will likely be a few iterations
that will not work, but over time they believe that they will get to a point where they
will be able to provide consumers with a beverage that offers reduced sugar content
and great taste.

Top Line Growth in the +3-4% Range in ’17 and ‘18
As highlighted earlier, we do think that Coke is taking steps that should help turn its
business around in regards to both their still and sparkling portfolios and have been
thoughtful about how to drive growth given their current portfolio mix. We will
provide more detail in the earnings section regarding our top line assumptions for '17
and '18, but at this stage we think that given KO's category mix (as well as continued
pressure from emerging markets), we think organic revenue growth will likely
remain below the company's long-term growth algorithm of +4-6%.

Organic Top Line Growth in the LSD Range
Management expects 2017 organic revenue growth of +3%, although the company
did seem to imply that their core business (which excludes the Bottling Investment
Group) will grow slightly faster than that and likely be at the low end of their long-
term organic sales growth range of +4-6%. Below are management’smain puts and
takes as it relates to organic sales growth:
1.) Price/mix will be a larger contributor to organic sales growth vs. volume
2.) Global environment similar to ’16, with continued challenges in emerging
and developing economies and continued growth in the developed world.
3.) Timing of Easter shifts into Q2 in '17 vs. Q1 in '16
We are currently forecasting organic revenuegrowth to be up roughly +3.3%year
over year, with total company volume up +1% and price/mix up roughly +2%.
Structural Impact on Top Line
Before discussing in more detail our gross profit and operating margin assumptions,
we think it is prudent to understand all the different moving pieces of what
management refers to as structural headwinds. As we discussed in more detail above,
the company’s bottling refranchising in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia is
going to have a significant impact onbothrevenues and profitsbefore tax in 2017.
The company currently expects 2017 revenue to be negatively impacted by roughly
-18-19% due to structural items. This headwind is comprised of four key moving
parts. First, the largest component is the expected reducedrevenues in the Bottling

Investment Group (BIG). This headwind shouldbe partially offset by a reduction in
eliminations (which works as a boost to sales), intercompany profit eliminations that
will flow through as a benefit in several geographic segments in year one, and sub-
bottling payments that will benefit North America.
Second, the sub-bottling paymentsare a result of how the Coca-Cola Company is
refranchising their North American territories. As a result of these transactions, the
company has entered into sub-bottling payment arrangements for the intangible
assets associated with the refranchised territories. These payments are initially
flowing through the North America segment at an even split between net revenue and
interest income.
Third, in addition to the sub-bottling payments, the geographic regions will also
have a benefit from intercompany profit eliminationsat the consolidated basis.
This occurs when the company sells concentrate to the company owned bottlers, they
are not able to recognize that concentrate revenue or profit until the bottling partner
has sold the finished products manufactured from concentrate to third party, which
essentially means that the concentrate profit in bottler inventory must be eliminated
when consolidated. As these bottlers are refranchised,the elimination is no longer
needed and is reversed during the period in which the transaction closes. This results
in a one-time profit increase that flows from revenue down to OI in the relevant
geographic segments. Given the number of transactions thatare expected to occur,
this should beroughly a +2% benefit on the consolidated level, with a much larger
benefit coming in North America. At this point,we think the biggest structural
benefit will likely come through the write-up of inventory vs. the sub-bottling
payments.
The fourthand final moving piece relatesto a reduction of intercompany sales
eliminations. These occur when Coke sells concentrate to the bottlers, this is booked
in the relevant geographic segments, butthen removed in the consolidated numbers
through eliminations. Therefore, as the revenue in BIG moves lower, so will the
eliminations. Historically, the revenue offset from eliminations was around roughly
24-25% of BIG net revenues. We do want to highlight that the eliminations piece
will not be part of the company’s reported structural impact, but just works as an
offset to the headwind. Ultimately,the net impact of the structural items net of the
eliminations shouldbe a -18-19% headwind for the year.

Total Revenue Growth for ‘17
With organic revenue growth of around +3%, structural headwinds of -18-19%, and
layering in -1-2% of FX headwinds in '17, total company revenue growth is expected
to be down -16-18%. We are currently forecasting total revenue growth to be down -
16.7%, which is slightly ahead of Bloomberg consensus of-17.5%.

Gross Margin, Operating Income, and Profit Before Taxes Outlook
One of the more difficult things to model over the course of the past year has been
KO's consolidated gross margin given the number of moving parts related to the
bottler refranchising. At the company's 2016 CAGNY presentation, management
highlighted that they would expect total company gross margin toimprove by
roughly 700 bps as a result of the bottler refranchising as the Bottling businesses the
company is divesting typically have gross margin between 35-40% (which is well
below the consolidated gross margin of around 61%). In ’16, the company did not
see this incremental benefit flow through the gross margin line due to the phasing of
the transactions in terms of distribution rights vs. production plants in North
America. As we look out to '17 (and 2018 for that matter), the company expects to
see much more of a structural benefit to gross margins as the plants in North America
should transfer at the same time as the distribution rights. In our view, it is still going
to be difficult to model consolidated gross profit on a quarterly basisas the timing of
the refranchising on a quarterly basis is still yet to be determined, but we think
that once we exit '17,the company will have recouped roughly half of the 700


Andrea Teixeira, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622-6735 21 March 2017

bps GM expansion, with the remaining coming in ’18. Said another way, we
believe that when we exit 2018, total company gross margins will be closer to the
pro-forma 68% that the company outlined during the past two CAGNY
presentations.
As it relates to PBT, before the impact of structural items and currency, management
expects +7-8% underlyinggrowth driven by strong operating performance partially
offset by an increasing interest rate environment. Structural items are anticipated to
be a -5-6% headwind to PBT: The Companyexpects the divested operating profit
and Canners operation in South Africa to have a negative impact on PBT, but this
shouldbe offset by increased equity investments, and favorability in the geographic
segments that wouldresult from the intercompany profit eliminations and sub-
bottling payments. In addition to the moving pieces at PBT related to structural
items, the company expects Fx to be a -3-4%headwind based on current spot rates
and hedged positions. All in, this implies a change in total company PBT in the range
of flat to -3%.
Wepoint outthat although the companydid not explicitly give operating profit
guidance, they did highlight that they believe therewill be 2 points of negative
leverage between the operating income and profit before tax line.
We are currently forecasting total company operating profit to bedown -1% on a
dollar basis, although total company OPM will increase by roughly 450bps YOY to
28.3% (vs. consensus of 28.2%). We expect PBT to be down -2%, which is towards
the mid-point of the company's guidance range.
EPS Forecasted to beDown -1-4% Y/Y
We are currently forecasting 2017 EPS to be $1.86, which is towards the low end of
the company’s implied guidance rangeof$1.84-$1.89. Aside from all the moving
pieces discussed above, we are forecasting a 2017 tax rate of 24% (up from 22.5% in
'16 and inline with guidance), with share repurchases of approximately $2B (down
from $3B in ’16 and also inline with guidance).

1Q17 Outlook
Although the company did not provide any underlying targets for 1Q17, they did
provide a few modeling items during their 4Q16 earnings call as it relates to timing.
Management highlighted that 1Q17 will have 2 fewer days vs. 1Q16 (which will
likely be a 200 bps headwind to revenue) as well as Easter shifting into 2Q17 vs.
1Q16 last year. In terms of structural items and FX, KO expects a -12-13% and -1-
2% headwind, respectively. All in, we believe 1Q17 organic revenue growth will
likely be below the company's full year guidance and with fewer selling days, FX,
and structural impacts, we expect total company revenue to be down nearly -15% vs.
consensusof -14%.
On a PBT basis, the company expects currency to be a -3-4% headwind, while
structural items will be a -1-2% impact. Although there are a number of moving
parts, we are currently forecasting 1Q17 EPS of $0.44,which is inline with
Bloomberg consensus.

Earnings Should Begin to Turn in ’18, But Are Numbers Done Going Down?
During their earnings call, management provided some color on their best estimate at
this point in time in regards to how structural items and FX will have an impact on
revenues and PBT. The company is currently forecasting structural items to have
anothernegative impact of -16 to -17% to top line and another -1 to -2% to PBT. In
addition, the company expects FX to be anLSD headwind and the 2018 tax rate to
move up another 200 bps Y/Y to 26%.

Although the company did not provide an outlook for underlying results, we think it
is tough to see a scenario in whichwe would see a meaningful improvement in
underlying trendsgiven the global backdrop and current beverage trends. The one
caveat would be a potential large cost savings initiative, which management alluded
to at the CAGNY conference. Assuming similar underlying PBT growth (+7-8%
growth)this implies 2018 EPS growth in the LSD range, which is an obvious
inflection point, but still well below other large-cap peers.

If FY18 guidance materializes, it would bea step in the right direction, and a
potential inflectionpoint, in our view, as it implies a 1.5% growth in EPS in
FY18, at the middleof the range. At this point, thereis limited visibilityaswe are
still in the first quarter of 2017 and there are a number of moving piecesin Coke’s
P&L, including timing of refranchising of additional territories. That said, if we look
at consensus right now for 2018, earnings are expected to grow+4.6% vs. the mid-
point of the company’s guidance, which seems somewhat optimistic givenwhat we
know at this point in time. We recognize that Coke has become more difficult to
modeldue to structural changesarising from mainlythe intercompany profit
eliminations and sub-bottling payments. We view management’s intention to provide
color on 2018this earlyas a way to level the playing field, with the hope of
eliminating some(not all) of the uncertainties. Alot of the negative revisions we see

belowin Figure 20and Figure 21are a result of the acceleration of the refranchising,
but evenafter that was announced in early '16,consensus estimates have continued to
move down.Lookingat just the last year alone, before the accelerated refranchising
was announced, consensus estimates came down by 9% (for '17) and 11% (for '18).
Assuming our implied range is a good proxy, we think consensus of $1.95for '18
may need to move down further.

Tax Reform Scenarios
While there are still many uncertainties on the potential border tax adjustment(BAT)
as proposed by the Trump administration and Speaker Paul Ryan’sblueprintfrom
June 24, 2016,and its potential side effects, we ran a sensitivity analysis to FY18
estimates. We also base our analysis onsome of the extensive studiesJPM’s U.S.
economist Mike Feroli wroteabout the tax reform, in particular the reportabout the
potential FX impact of BAT. Our model is flexible to different assumptions, and

available upon request. We based the assumptions below on consensus view of the
following key potential changes:
1. 20% border tax
2. 20% marginal corporate tax rate in the U.S.
3. Non-deductibility of imported products and raw materials from the federal
taxable income. Of the US operations, we assume 0% of cost of goods sold
are imported.
4. Non-deductibility interest expense from taxable income, albeitthemost
common assumption is that it would be applicable only to new debt. For the
purpose of this exercise,we are assuming 0% of interest expense is
deductible from taxable income (inline withPaulRyan’s proposal).
5. Tax holiday for cash overseas -repatriation rate of 9%. As of December 31,
2016, roughly 91% of Coke's cash is held overseas.

Tax Reform WouldLikely Be Positive for KO Assuming No $ Appreciation
We believe thepotentialtax reform will have anLDDpositive impact on KO’sEPS
FY18E if we assume that the USD will not appreciate relative to the basket of
currencies of its international operations. Manyeconomists, however, including our
U.S. economic team,believe that the border tax (if implemented) will be followed by
an appreciation of the U.S. dollar, which would hurt the translation of Coca-Cola’s
international results into USD.
Like Other Multi-Nationals, $ Appreciation Remains Biggest Unknown
When we add ina layer of potential impact of U.S. dollar appreciation against other
currencies as a result of thepotentialreform,the economic theory is that currencies
will adjust to the impact on trade. This is particularly relevant for Cokegiven that
approximately 65% of KO’ssales (JPMe post bottler refranchising) is international
and istranslated into U.S. dollars. We assume that the USD will appreciate at a beta
of 50% of the proposed border tax (so 50% of a 20% border tax implies a 10%
appreciation of the dollar), as highlighted in the table above. We also adjust our
equity income assumptions to account for this dollar appreciation (we assume
roughly 85% of the company’s equity income is international after excluding MNST
and COKE). Under this scenario, KO’s we estimate that EPS would still increase
roughly 5%primarily as a result of the share buybacks (see below).


Andrea Teixeira, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622-6735 21 March 2017

U.S. Impact of Potential Border Tax Likely Would Be Low for KO
We believe that there would be little to no impact on KO from a potential border tax.
Coca-Cola sells concentrate that is produced in U.S. territories for theirU.S.business
and does not source any material part of their cost of goods sold (mostly concentrate)
from international markets and they do not export any material portion of theirsales.
Cash Repatriation Would Work
With roughly $20.2B of cash sitting overseas (according to KO's latest 10-K filed
last month), we believe that one of the biggest offsets to any dollar appreciation as it
relates to tax reform wouldcome from cash repatriation. For the purpose of this
exercise,we are assuming that some of the cash will remain overseas (roughly 50%)
and that the cash that is brought back will be used to repurchase shares. We would
also point out that given the company's gross debt balance ($42.2B), this could be
used to pay down debt. If we were to exclude the benefit of share repurchases in this
exercise, then we estimate earnings would be down slightly.

Valuation
We are introducing our December 2017 price target of $43, whichis based on 22.5x
our 2018 EPS estimate of $1.92, which represents limited upside from current levels.
We think using a 22.5x is justified as it is roughly inline with the company’s current
multiple, which we think reflects the top and bottom line earnings growth outlook for
the company.The 22.5x timesis also anchored by the similar P/E18E for non-
alcoholic peers, as we see in the table below. The premium/discount relative to large-


Andrea Teixeira, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622-6735 21 March 2017

cap multi-national peers (which we define as an average of KO, PEP, CL, PG, and
KMB) is slightly ahead of the company’s 2-year and 5-year averages.
We believe until earnings growth shows a re-acceleration or is more inline with
other LC peers, we think investors can afford to be patient. In our view, there is
limited upside to the company’s current multiple and any price appreciation in the
stock wouldcome from better-than-anticipated earnings performance.

Although it seems that manyinvestors understand that Coke has had its fair share of
issues over the years, we think it still comes as a surprise that Coke has
underperformed both the market and XLP by -26%, respectively,since the end of
2013, which is the worst performance of any stock in our coverage universe. We
believe the issue currently is that most of the stock’s underperformance has been
driven by negative earnings revisions (see above), and the stock is ultimately not as
cheap as the underperformance would indicate.

As mentioned above, we believe that other large (or mega-cap) U.S.listed Staples
names with large international exposure, such as Pepsi, Procter & Gamble, Colgate
Palmolive, Estee Lauder, and Kimberly-Clark are the best comps for The Coca-Cola
Company. Thesecompanies typically have similar underlying revenue growth and
have diverse geographic mix that can help provide stability to top line growth, but as
we have seen over the past few years, it can also drive significant currency
headwinds. Relative to the large-cap multi-national average, KO is currently trading
at anLSDdiscount to peers, which is slightlyahead of the company'shistorical
averages.

EV/EBITDA Looks More Expensive
On an absolute basis, KO does not look cheap relative to peers on an EV/EBITDA
basis. Cokeis currently trading at17.9xour ‘17 EBITDA forecast, which is a 27%
premium to other large-cap multinational peers.We believe this discrepancy is due to
two factors: (1) KO's historically low tax rate. (2) Coke has had net interest
income/low interest expense, despite having $24bn in net debtas of 4Q16.The only
stocks that look more expensive in our coverage universe on EV/EBITDA are
Brown-Forman, Monster, and e.l.f.

Relative to PEP
Relative to the company's largest global competitor, Coke is currently trading at a
LSD premium to Pepsi. Although this is ahead of both the 2-year and 5-year average,
it is slightly belowthe long-term average of anMSD premium.

Tickers: KO
What’s Incremental
With KO management conveying increased optimism around the company’s ability to deliver on all aspects of its long-
term algorithm post-pandemic, CEO James Quincey and CFO John Murphy delivered a very balanced presentation delving
into the key factors supporting both long-term aspirations for accelerated growth and the levers at KO’s disposal to
improve profitability hand in hand.
· In recent months, KO has made multiple references to the “high-end” of its +4-6% long-term revenue growth
algorithm in discussions around emerging from the pandemic “stronger.” Today, management formally put a +5-6%
goal on the board and also provided a bridge detailing the factors supporting this outlook. To this point, while market
growth is expected to trend at ~4%, strategic initiatives introduced over the past year (portfolio optimization,
bringing scale and discipline to innovation, improve marketing effectiveness, leveraging data to inform RGM in the
marketplace and targeted resource allocation), are expected to contribute ~1-2pts to growth with further expansion
into emerging markets adding up to 50 bps to top-line, altogether leaving room for the company’s category mix to be
up to a ~25 bps headwind.
· In discussing the path to delivering on long-term goals for +6-8% operating income growth, KO’s presentation
had new detail around opportunities available to improve profitability across each of its different business models.
Within the Bottling Investments Group, we’ve already started to see what a more proactive approach to managing
these assets (vs. its prior moniker of being a “hospital ward”) can yield with efforts to optimize trade promotion
driving noticeable improvements to price/mix over the past several quarters. In terms of opportunities highlighted
today, we took particular note of a reference to “evaluating asset-light models” within the finished goods business
given implications for North America profitability. Recall, with refranchising of other assets now complete, it has been
our view that time and resources have likely been freed up to dedicate to reassessing the next rung of opportunities
in the supply chain (eg. franchising the fountain, and/or juice & stills businesses) (10.28.20: Management Meeting
Tidbits). While we have wondered about potential dilution to earnings from a decision to this tune, in the breakout
session, Mr. Murphy noted that this should not be a key issue for KO even in the short term.
· With regard to innovation and marketing in particular, with recent portfolio and organizational changes being
made in the spirit of bringing greater scale to the company’s strongest ideas (10.08.20: Institutionalizing the
Change), the company offered a nice preview of Sprite’s first global marketing campaign which will promote both
regular Sprite and Sprite Zero. At the same time, here too, management emphasized the importance of driving the
right balance between big bets and “intelligent experiments” to support both growth and profitability. To this point,
we learned that 2021 plans include a 40% increase in innovation projects which are expected to drive 20% of the
incremental gross profit KO is looking to generate this year. Additionally, while ~25% of the projects will be big,
scaled bets representing half the value of the full pipeline, there will be 11 “experiments” comprising ~20% of the
pipeline (with calculated experimentation expected to play a bigger role in the years to come).
· With the option for KO to acquire the remaining ownership interest in BodyArmor becoming exercisable this year,
this morning, KO filed a pre-acquisition notification with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) relating to its intent to

acquire a controlling interest in BodyArmor. As we think back to Wednesday’s Australian Open semi-final between
Naomi Osaka (BodyArmor spokesperson) and Serena Williams (Gatorade spokesperson), we can’t help but draw
parallels to shifting trends in the sports drinks category itself with BodyArmor representing a “new generation” of
sports drinks chipping away at the market leadership position long held by PepsiCo’s Gatorade. According to
Numerator household panel data, household penetration for BodyArmor is still in the low 20s (vs. Gatorade in the low
70s), implying significant runway for growth in the former from here especially with even more scaled marketing
muscle behind the brand.
What to do with the stock
Organization design gets too little attention in the investment community, as it can be hard to understand from the
outside just how roles & responsibilities flow within large, global companies. While we have been enthusiastic about the
potential for a “networked” KO to drive improved growth and profitability over time, we are struck by the pace at which
benefits of changes ways of working are beginning to accrue to the P&L in 2021.
As always, please feel free to call with any questions or comments.
Best,
Lauren

universe over a 12-month investment horizon.

coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.

JPM 4Q19 EPS Instant Insight – Trading drives EPS
beat
Stock Rating/Industry View: Overweight/Positive
Price Target: USD 168.00
Price (13-Jan-2020): USD 137.20
Potential Upside/Downside: 22%
Tickers: JPM
Bottom line
JPM posted an EPS beat. Relative to expectations, higher than expected trading revenues (FICC followed
by equities), as well as IB fees (broad-based), and a lower than expected loan loss provision helped to fuel
the beat. Its 1Q20 outlook for NII and expenses appears to approximate expectations.
Outlook
1Q20 net interest income: ~$14bn ($14.3bn in 4Q19) vs. consensus of $13.9bnn
1Q20 adjusted expenses: ~$17bn ($16.1bn in 4Q19; implies 3% y-o-y growth) vs. consensus of $16.8bn
1Q20 tax rate: ~17%, reflecting the impact of stock-based comp (19.4% in 4Q19 and 18.3% in 1Q19), vs. consensus of
20.1%
CECL: adoption increases loan loss reserve by $4.3bn (guided to $4-$6bn) and decreases retained earnings by $2.7bn
(phased in over 4 years so 4bp hit in 1Q20).
Key takeaways
EPS beat. JPM reported 4Q19 EPS of $2.57. Consensus was $2.36. Relative to expectations, higher than expected
trading revenues (FICC followed by equities), as well as IB fees (broad-based), and a lower than expected loan loss
provision helped to fuel the beat.
""One-timers"" essentially offset. Results included $123mn of securities gains, up from $78mn last quarter. Credit
Adjustments & Other in CIB was a gain of $126mn, reflecting lower funding spreads on derivatives, compared with a loss
of $71mn in the prior quarter. It released $93mn of loan loss reserves, compared to a $108mn reserve build in 3Q19. It
had $35mn of MSR risk management gains. And, CB had gain on a strategic investment. These totaled over $377mn.
Still, it booked $190mn of net markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments (in other) and posted a $241mn
of legal expenses, totaling $431mn.
Revs up y-o-y, buyback continues. Managed revenues increased 9% y-o-y but fell 3% linked quarter to $29.2bn.
Tangible book rose 0.8% to $60.98 (2.2x). It posted a 14% ROE, 17% ROTCE, and 1.22% ROA. CET1 was 12.4% (11-12%
target), up 10bps, and SLR was unchanged at 6.3%. It repurchased $6.9bn of its shares in 4Q19, approximating the prior
quarter (47% done w/ $29.4bn CCAR 2019 ask). Average diluted shares declined by 1.8%
Card leads CCB. Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) revenues rose 5% y-o-y and slipped 1% linked quarter to
$4.2bn. Relative to 4Q18, Card, Merchant Services & Auto increased 9% (higher card net interest income on loan growth
and margin expansion, as well as higher auto lease volumes), while Home Lending (-5%; lower net interest income on
lower balances, and lower net servicing revenue, predominantly offset by higher net production revenue) and Consumer

& Business Banking (-2%; impact of deposit margin compression, largely offset by growth in deposit balances, and fee
income from higher client investment assets and account and transaction growth) declined.
Trading better than expected in CIB. Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) revenues rose 31% y-o-y and rose 1%
linked quarter to $9.5bn. Trading revenues jumped 56% y-o-y (guided to “up meaningfully”) with FICC up 85% (favorable
comparison against a weak prior year; reflected strength across businesses, notably in Securitized Products and Rates,
driven by strong client activity and monetizing flows) and equities growing 15% (driven by higher revenue in Prime and
Cash Equities). Total investment banking fees rose 5% y-o-y (guided to little change) but declined 4% from 3Q19.
Relative to the prior quarter, advisory increased (+39%) while both debt (-15%) and equity (-26%) underwriting
declined. Treasury Services fell 3% y-o-y (deposit margin compression predominantly offset by higher balances and fee
growth) but rose 7% from 3Q19, while Securities Services rose 3% on both a y-o-y (organic growth partially offset by
deposit margin compression) and q-o-q basis. Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $126mn, reflecting lower
funding spreads on derivatives, compared with a loss of $71mn in the prior quarter.
CB and AWM revs up q-o-q. Commercial Banking (CB) revenues declined 3% y-o-y (lower net interest income driven
by lower deposit margin, largely offset by higher deposit balances, and higher fees from deposit fees and a gain on a
strategic investment) but rose 1% from 3Q19 to $2.2bn. Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) revenues rose 8% y-o-y
(driven by higher investment valuations and average market levels, as well as deposit and loan growth, partially offset by
deposit margin compression) and grew 4% linked quarter to $3.7bn.
NII slips. Net interest income declined 0.4% from 3Q19. Average earning assets rose 1% with securities (+15%) and
deposits with banks (+2%) higher; loans little changed (though core +1%); and Fed Funds sold (-10%), securities
borrowed (-3%) and trading assets (-5%) lower. Average total loans declined 1% y-o-y, though increased closer 3%
excluding the impact of loan sales in Home Lending. Period-end loans increased 2% from 3Q19 with credit card up 6%,
wholesale growing 2%, and consumer unchanged.
NIM declines but deposit costs lower. Its net interest margin declined 3bps to 2.38%. Its yield on average earning
assets fell 21bps to 3.35% (loans -19bps, securities -27bps), while its cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased 25bps
to 1.22% (IBD -18bps after -11bps in 3Q19). Still, its net interest margin ex CIB markets dropped 17bps to 3.6%.
Deposits rose 2% sequentially, with increases in both U.S. NIBD (+1%) and U.S. IBD (+4%).
Costs controlled. Fee income rose 21% y-o-y but declined 6% from 3Q19. Linked quarter, lending & deposit fees, card
income, and other increased, while investment banking fees, principal transactions, and mortgage declined. Expenses
rose 4% y-o-y (driven by higher volume- and revenue-related expense, including comp and auto lease depreciation) but
declined 1% from 3Q19. Its managed overhead ex. legal ratio was 55%. It posted a 19.4% effective tax rate (25.6%
managed), down from 20.4% (25.1%) last quarter.
Asset quality benign. NALs/loans improved 9bps to 0.43%. Non-performing assets declined 16%, or $846mn, to
$4.5bn. Its NCO ratio (ex. PCI) increased 5bps to 0.65%. Consumer NCOs rose 6bps to 0.17%, credit card increased 6bps
to 3.01%, and wholesale grew 2bps to 0.12%. It released $93mn of loan loss reserves, compared to a $108mn reserve
build in 3Q19. In Home Lending, the current period included a reserve release in the PCI portfolio of $250mn, reflecting
improvements in delinquencies and home prices. Still, Card had a $100mn reserve build, driven by growth (stated while
NCOs were higher, they were in line with expectations). Still, CIB’s and CB’s results included reserve builds on select
client downgrades. Its reserve/loan ratio declined 1bp to 1.31%.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or
Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are
deemed to be in the same industry (“the industry coverage universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a
particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as
Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the
equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of
all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.

Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target:
Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's
expectation of where the stock will trade in the next 12 months. Upside/downside scenarios, where provided,
represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period.
Top Picks:
Barclays Equity Research's ""Top Picks"" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry
(as defined by the relevant ""industry coverage universe""), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that
industry. Barclays Equity Research publishes ""Top Picks"" reports every quarter and analysts may also publish intra-
quarter changes to their Top Picks, as necessary. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their
published research in addition to their Top Pick, there can only be one ""Top Pick"" for each industry. To view the current

On the macro level, we believe

2017 holiday season exceeded expectations. NRF data shows that total retail

sales increased 5.5% y/y in Nov and Dec, above forecast of 3.6-4%, representing
best level since 2010. E-commerce continued to grow faster than broader retail,
which, according to Adobe, increased 14.6% y/y, also ahead of prior forecast of
13.8%. NetElixir, a search marketing agency who analyzed e-commerce traffic data,
estimated 13% y/y increase in holiday e-commerce sales, above its 10% initial

We believe Prime continued to be key driver in driving

Amazon also leads other retailers in terms of conversion
rate. According to Hitwise, Amazon enjoyed nearly 7% conversion rate during the
holiday season, more than double its closest competitor, and conversion for most
retailers were 1-3%. As a result, Hitwise data showed that Amazon accounted for
39% of total visits but over 69% of total transactions.

 Expect continued growth momentum in advertising business. The
company’s Other revenue, which is comprised primarily of advertising and
credit card revenue grew 58% y/y to $1.1B in 3Q17. We believe the strong
growth was driven mainly by its advertising business. For 4Q17, we estimate
Other revenue to grow 60% y/y to $1.7B. We estimate Other revenue should
reach $6.9B in 2018, representing 50% y/y growth and 3% of total revenue.
We believe our estimate could prove conservative as three of world’s largest
ad agencies recently indicated to significantly increase spending with
Amazon in 2018 (WPP +40-50% y/y, Omnicom +100% y/y, and Publicis
+50% y/y). While still a relatively small percentage of total revenue, we
believe Advertising revenue could meaningfully lift its N. America segment
operating income given its high margin profile.
 Profitability upside. We estimate 4Q17 GAAP operating income of $1.55B.
at the high end of guidance and above consensus of $1.50B. We estimate non-
GAAP operating income of $2.85B, also above consensus of $2.75B. We
believe Cloud contributed to most of the upside, although the rapidly
increasing advertising revenue could modestly lift the overall margin as well.

Valuation (Price Target: $1,600.00)
■
Our price target of $1,600 is based on the sum-of-the-parts analysis, which evaluates North America and International
segments using EV/Revenue multiple, and AWS segment using EV/EBITDA multiple. Our price target is also below 7.3x FY18
Risskasle tso m Tualrtgipelte of its large-cap peers.
■
Risks to attaining our share price target include, but are not limited to: 1) a decline in discretionary consumer spending, 2) slow
adoption of Prime membership internationally, 3) increased e-commerce competition both domestically and internationally,
4) slowdown of revenue and operating margin growth of AWS due to competition and continued pricing cuts, 5) lack of traction
in new products, such as groceries and home services, and 6) potential regulatory changes and uncertainties particularly in
international markets.

Needham & Company, LLC employs a rating system based on the following:
Strong Buy: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to outperform the average total return of the broader market as well as the securities in the
analyst’s coverage universe over the next 12 months.
Buy: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to outperform the average total return of the broader market over the next 12 months.
Hold: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to perform approximately in line with the average total return of the broader market over the next
12 months.
Underperform: A security, which at the time the rating is instituted, we expect to underperform the average total return of the broader market over the next 12 months.
Rating Suspended: We have suspended the rating and/or price target, if any, for this security, because there is not a sufficient fundamental basis for determining a rating or
price target. The previous rating and price target, if any, are no longer in effect and should not be relied upon. This rating also includes the previous designation of ""Under
Review"".
Restricted: Needham & Company, LLC policy and/or applicable law and regulations preclude certain types of communications, including an investment recommendation,
during the course of Needham & Company, LLC’s engagement in an investment banking transaction and in certain other circumstances.
For disclosure purposes, in accordance with FINRA requirements, please note that our Strong Buy and Buy ratings most closely correspond to a ""Buy"" recommendation.
When combined, 74% of companies under coverage would have a ""Buy"" rating and 17% have had investment banking services provided within the past 12 months. Hold
ratings mostly correspond to a ""Hold/Neutral"" recommendation; while our Underperform rating closely corresponds to the ""Sell"" recommendation required by the FINRA.
Our rating system attempts to incorporate industry, company and/or overall market risk and volatility. Consequently, at any given point in time, our investment rating on
a security and its implied price appreciation may not correspond to the stated 12-month price target. For valuation methods used to determine our price targets and risks
related to our price targets, please contact your Needham & Company, LLC salesperson for a copy of the most recent research report.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Walmart, Inc. (WMT)
Investment Thesis
WMT has made strong progress in its repositioning in recent years against high initial skepticism, and the pace of change should be
applauded. The company has essentially turned itself into Amazon's biggest online retail competitor while returning its stores to positive
trac growth. Overall, we have been impressed with the eort. Though the company lost share during COVID, we expect momentum to
reaccelerate given normalizing consumer behavior, tailwinds from monthly CTC payments, and easier comparisons relative to other retail
peers. While concerns around investment and the magnitude of medium-term growth remain, WMT looks like a good name to own in
consumer at the moment. We rate WMT shares Overweight.
Target Price Valuation for WMT: $165.00 from NC
Our $165 price target reects 25x our 2022 earnings estimate.
Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WMT
Risks include: 1) Trac/comps could slow as in-store initiatives mature. Some COVID-related behavior could stick, causing consumers
to prefer local grocers. 2) Food cost ination could pressure margins if pass-through becomes dicult. 3) Higher digital mix could
permanently dilute the company's margin prole if eorts to curb losses through improved fulllment, automation, technology, etc. are
unsuccessful. 4) Ongoing cost pressure (e.g., labor, freight) could oset top-line gains. 5) The company operates in an intensely competitive
environment.

by a modest haircutto our revenue growth estimates for iPhone (primarily iPhone J.P. Morgan Securities LLC

above consensus (and bullish) expectations for iPhone revenue growth is now J.P. Morgan Securities LLC

see upside on several aspects of the business as well as
financials that remain underappreciated by investors, namely
the transformation of the company to Services, growth in the

Risks to Rating and Price Target
Industry Downside Risks
Deceleration or contraction in the handset and smartphone market could be
faster than expected.Economic conditions or shifting consumer demand could
cause greater-than-expected deceleration or contraction in the handset and
smartphone markets. This would negatively impact Apple’s prospects for growth,
and the shares may fail to achieve our price target as a result.
Increase in competitive pressures in international markets. Apple is increasingly
participating in international markets, such as China and India, where local players,
which are better situated, could leverage their position, and pull on levers such as
pricing to make the market more competitive. In addition, tariffs enacted by local
governments may further hurt Apple’s ability to compete effectively in international
markets.
Company-Specific Downside Risks
Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could be fruitless. Apple
has historically invested in new business strategies and acquisitions. As such, success
on these investments has low visibility at this time and could lead to greater-than-
expected liabilities and expense. Additionally, new investments could have a
negative impact on current operations by distracting management.
Key man risk around departure of chief executive officer. While risks related to
departure of management executives appear considerably lower relative to the past,
we believe the execution on strategic priorities under CEO Tim Cook’s leadership
still present modest risk to the share price, although we see a strong group of
executives to support business performance without disruptions.

Caution Prevails Ahead of WMT’s Analyst Day & 4Q
Results But Thesis Intact
Stock Rating/Industry View: Overweight/Neutral
Price Target: USD 135.00
Price (11-Feb-2020): USD 115.40
Potential Upside/Downside: 17%
Tickers: WMT
WMT will host its Investment Community Meeting on Tuesday, February 18th at the NYSE – the last event
was hosted in October 2018.
The Set-Up: While we continue to believe WMT’s share gains in the near/intermediate/long term are sustainable, we are
concerned 4Q results could be a little noisy given the industry backdrop in Toys and the potential for some weakness in
Electronics. Investors certainly also appear concerned – given that WMT’s stock is down -2.9% YTD versus the S&P up
3.9% - meaning the bar has come down for 4Q – but the overriding concern beyond 4Q is whether or not a weaker than
expected 4Q on comp and/or E-comm growth will play in to the resurfacing of an AMZN “one-day Prime” competitive
narrative. Along these lines, there appears to be a view that WMT will have to unveil a “next wave” of digital investments
to address AMZN – if in fact top line slowed in 4Q. While we believe any potential softness in 4Q is transient in nature
(and related to noise more than anything) – we appreciate the fact that investors will remain cautious until the AMZN
narrative dissipates. Net: while we are cautious going in to results, the thesis remains intact and we would
use any weakness as a buying opportunity.
In this note, we provide color on the debates we are engaged in heading in to next Tuesday – but our quick take on the
two most pressing topics is the following:
First, while we understand the trepidation surrounding 4Q comps, the quarter will be exceptionally noisy (shortened
holiday season, SNAP impact in 2019 and also 2013 etc.), so sentiment will largely hinge on the context management
can provide around both the holiday performance and the profit growth opportunity in FY21 & FY22. In the near-term, to
the extent key holiday categories such as toys and electronics simply slowed across the industry, WMT is not immune –
but we think the 4Q comps bar is now <2%. On the other hand, to the extent six fewer holiday shopping days was
the bigger problem - as we believe it was - WMT should:
a) be less exposed due to next-day e-comm capabilities (versus TGT) and non-discretionary grocery traffic,
b) see normalized trends post the holidays (ex. the January SNAP headwind) so to the extent WMT would be willing to
comment on February trends – this could alleviate concerns, and,
c) benefit given the non-discretionary nature of their sales mix to the extent shopping trips were consolidated.
Said differently, while we firmly believe the shortened holiday period impacted many retailers, and believe 4Q results
might play in to the AMZN narrative for now, we do not believe the next day offering impacted WMT’s sales, although we
acknowledge we might not be proven right until WMT reports 1Q on May 19th.

Second, we do not believe WMT will need to engage in a next wave of e-comm investments. The AMZN “one-day Prime”
narrative has driven - in part – concern amongst some investors that WMT will need to invest much more in digital to
“keep up” with AMZN. To us, the unveiling of additional large scale digital investment would run counter to
much of WMT’s communication to the Street, and, perhaps more importantly, appears neither necessary
nor likely given the acceleration in core U.S. EBIT trends. Instead, we believe WMT will drive home the message
that: 1) its investment plans have been appropriate, and profitability (rate) is set to inflect in the near-medium term; and
2) it continues to separate itself from the pack (especially from conventional grocers) with respect to value, customer
service, product offerings, and digital infrastructure.
Notwithstanding the 4Q comp trend – which may come in below consensus – and investor concerns
emerging (addressed in detail below), we expect Tuesday’s meeting to be constructive and remain bullish
on WMT. We maintain our $135 price target, which reflects a ~12x FY21 EV/EBITDA and implies ~17% upside vs the
current price.
Below, we highlight 4 key investor concerns which reflect the debates we are engaged in heading in to next
Tuesday, as well as our thoughts on each:
Key Investor Concern #1: Comps have slowed, causing an AMZN “one-day Prime” narrative to surface.
In general, based on our conversations, investors have triangulated TGT’s weak comp, the sequential softening of credit
card data for Walmart, and the recent resignation of former U.S. Chief merchant Steve Bratspies, to mean that U.S. core
comps in 4Q will be somewhat “squishy”. As a reminder, WMT’s FY20 U.S. comp expectations gravitated toward ~3% for
the year after August’s guidance update (in which management said comps would be towards the “upper-end” of +2.5%
to +3%). So following 3Q results, which did not materially alter full year expectations, implied 4Q expectations were
initially in the high 2% range. We now believe investors expect a 1.5%-2% comp in 4Q. As a result, investors are
beginning to question the sustainability of recent comp trends into 4Q and beyond, and are pointing to AMZN’s
aggressive rollout of one-day delivery as a reason.
Our rebuttal: While comp may come in below consensus, the root cause is likely transitory based on Toys and
Electronics noise, but we also believe WMT may have been somewhat insulated given WMT’s non-discretionary exposure
– at >65% of sales. Separately, WMT’s e-commerce platform continues to be well positioned vs. Amazon with next-day
delivery, and grocery pick-up/delivery.
By now, it is pretty clear that the 6 fewer holiday shopping days wreaked havoc across bricks and mortar retail, as
consumers were time-strapped and likely relied on faster delivery options, or in some cases did not make that marginal
holiday purchase at all. That said, while certainly not immune, we believe WMT was somewhat insulated from
the malaise given: a) lower discretionary exposure and #1 grocery positioning in the U.S. (>65% of sales
from grocery, HBA and Rx), and b) a relatively well developed digital platform, which reached ~75% of the
population with free next day delivery during the holidays. WMT’s same-day grocery platform also continued to
migrate general merchandise items into it, adding yet another layer of convenience. Further, WMT’s food shop results in
a much higher frequency of necessary visits, and given the shortened holiday season, customers may have been
consolidating trips to retailers at a higher rate. Finally, as alluded to above, the speed of fulfilment matters when
customers are time-strapped, and WMT’s expansion of free next day delivery was likely a key differentiating factor. All
that said, any potential weakness, if attributed mostly to the 6 fewer shopping days, is only temporary.
With respect to specific categories, it is – admittedly - unclear if the 6 fewer days directly caused certain
categories, such as toys and electronics, to be weak, or if underlying trends in these categories are just
soft. We tend to believe it is a combination of both. For context, while WMT no longer breaks out its electronics
exposure, the electronics and toys categories made up ~13% of annual sales combined in FY10 (the last time this
category was broken out) and electronics alone is likely in the 13% of sales range in 4Q (versus ~10% annually).
In toys, after last year’s windfall for retailers from the Toys R Us bankruptcy, the category overall appears to have slowed,
trending down during the holidays. To us, many retailers appeared to have relied too much on: a) the benefit from Frozen
assortments – nearly everyone was carrying Frozen products, and b) continued share gains in the category – not
everyone can gain share. Furthermore, the TRU liquidation in 2018 may have resulted in a lot of excess inventory sold
during the 2018 holidays that the industry lapped in 2019 – a potential headwind. While WMT will likely outperform
the overall category, our sense is that toys in general will not be a great category for WMT.

In electronics, reads appear to be mixed as despite TGT’s soft result and no clear signs of strength at AMZN, COST (which
also has a big grocery business) performed well in its “majors” category (which includes electronics) in Nov/Dec and
industry data-points suggest BBY is taking share. It is worth noting that BBY, like WMT offers free next day delivery on the
majority of purchases. While we don’t necessarily expect a strong showing, our sense is that WMT may be
more in the winner’s camp with respect to electronics.
Finally, we wouldn’t read anything into the departure of former Chief U.S. Merchant Steve Bratspies with
respect to 4Q trends. WMT often makes executive changes right before the end of the fiscal year, and new leadership
at WMT U.S. from John Furner (who replaced Greg Foran after his departure) may have catalyzed more change. Further,
Mr. Bratspies was apparently passed over for the WMT U.S. and Sam’s CEO jobs, so in light of those facts, his departure
doesn’t come as a complete surprise.
Key Investor Concern #2: There is a “next wave” of digital investments needed to address AMZN, which
will result in below consensus FY21 EBIT.
The core U.S. business has continued to grow EBIT sustainably in the MSD range. However, continued MSD+ core growth
relies in the premises that: a) WMT has been investing appropriately, and does not need a significant new “wave” of
digital investments, and b) WMT can deliver steady comp performance needed to drive SG&A leverage (given ongoing
GM pressure). Tying this into the AMZN “one-day Prime” narrative, investors are worried that WMT will need to invest
significantly more, due in part to an AMZN driven comp slowdown. With consensus consolidated EBIT growth at
+4% for FY21, concerns have emerged that WMT will guide to +LSD EBIT growth or lower.
Our rebuttal: WMT’s strong underlying growth trajectory is sustainable and is still early stage on gaining momentum.
Consensus appears reasonable as it relates to how WMT will guide – but if we had to bet on where FY21 EPS will
ultimately settle (to be clear – not guide) – we believe it will be closer to $6. Said differently, even if WMT guides below
the Street, such guidance will prove conservative.
A MSD EBIT algorithm is supported by multiple comp drivers. Despite the near-term noise, WMT’s comp trajectory
is supported by the continued rollout of pickup/delivery, next-day delivery, widening price gaps in food (see details in key
investor concern #3 below), private label growth, and merchandising improvements. In-home delivery, “Produce 2.0”, e-
commerce efficiency initiatives, and the evolution of the supercenter (addition of WMT Health) are areas where we
expect management to provide more color on Tuesday. Again, we do not believe AMZN’s one-day Prime rollout has
negatively impacted WMT.
We don’t share most investors’ margin concerns for the following reasons:
1. We believe WMT’s investment cadence in recent years has built up the appropriate digital foundation
whereby additional large-scale margin/capex investments are not necessary. While it is practically impossible
to parse out exactly how much WMT has invested in technology/digital in recent years, we believe the largest
infrastructure investments – click & collect/delivery infrastructure, EDC investments (SKU mirroring, automation etc.),
talent (engineers etc.), and robust app/data analytics development - are generally behind the company.
2. WMT has generally communicated to the Street that digital profitability (rate) will inflect – while the
exact timing is unknown, we don’t envision a dramatic change in tone. Along these lines, WMT has discussed
improving profitability trends due in part to: 1) the continued mirroring of SKUs across EDCs (significantly lowers split
shipments/shipping costs); 2) the potential for fixed cost leverage as e-commerce top line continues to grow quickly; 3)
the additions of higher margin general merchandise SKUs to the grocery app; and 4) greater picking efficiencies as
technology is increasingly leveraged. We believe WMT’s e-commerce business can continue to grow the top line
at a 30%+ clip driven by continued expansion/adoption of grocery pickup/delivery, general merchandise integration
into the grocery app, SKU/brands and third party marketplace expansion, and the continued next day delivery rollout.
3. EDLC should continue to be prominent. While cost pressure from wages/supply chain may continue, we argue
that SG&A progress will also be a function of sales growth matched with efficiencies – leveraging technology and new
processes to reduce the “work” associates do in inventory management, stocking, check-out (vis-à-vis self-checkouts –
now at over 60% of check-outs based on our estimates) etc., in order to drive an improved customer experience, better
in-stocks, and incremental volume/traffic.
Lapping Flipkart dilution should also boost enterprise-wide growth. WMT has been clear that it continues to plan
for a significant business in India in the future. While Flipkart is a business that has increased the level of anxiety for

investors in the past given regulatory hurdles in India, WMT has said that the business has performed as initially
expected, so FY20 losses are likely in the ~$0.60 range. We estimate Flipkart was a ~$0.40 incremental headwind
in FY20 and EPS growth ex Flipkart will be ~9% in FY20 – so lapping this should result in, at least, a MSD
percentage point increase to run rate growth vs. our modeled FY20 adj. EPS growth rate of ~2%. While there
will be volatility with respect to India, the general tone coming out of WMT is that operating losses are being ring-fenced.
Investors will be listening closely for any change in tone with regards to India and also WMT’s plans for the PhonePe
asset, which has been valued at ~$10B per media discussions.
Our thoughts on FY21 guidance: WMT will provide FY21 guidance on Tuesday, but do not expect the company to
quantify earnings expectations beyond FY21. The Street’s FY21 EPS forecast of $5.23 reflects 4.6% EPS growth, and
includes: a) 2.8% U.S. comps, b) 4.5% growth in U.S. EBIT, and c) 4.0% growth in consolidated EBIT. We are forecasting
EPS of $5.30 including a) 2.8% U.S. comps, b) 4.8% growth in U.S. EBIT, and c) 4.1% growth in consolidated EBIT. There is
growing concern that WMT will guide to +LSD EBIT growth (or even lower), similar to initial FY20 guidance. While we
wouldn’t rule this out, such guidance will ultimately prove to be very conservative in our view. We believe an
appropriate framework should include +LSD U.S. comps, +L-MSD operating income growth, and +MSD EPS
growth.
Key Investor Concern #3: Execution in grocery will suffer in the wake of former U.S. CEO Greg Foran’s
departure.
Many credit Mr. Foran as the key architect of the strategies responsible for WMT’s significant improvements in grocery in
recent years – particularly the strides made in fresh. As a result, some investors are antsy about WMT’s strategic
direction in U.S. grocery.
Our rebuttal: The grocery landscape is unfolding in a manner that is increasingly favorable for WMT. Our checks
suggest the gap in conventional grocery between WMT and direct competitors continues to expand in the two most
important areas – value and convenience.
With respect to value specifically, our pricing checks indicate that pricing gaps to competitors such as
Kroger continue to widen. While CPI inflation has trended below 1% in recent months, KR noted in its 3Q call that its
own price inflation has been above 1%. Conversely, WMT noted that it actually saw slight deflation in food (despite
higher costs) in 3Q and some consumables inflation, although a lot of that inflation was not passed on to customers due
to investments. In our view, KR has been increasingly less focused on EDLP and more focused on convincing
customers that it stands for higher quality, fresher product.
Furthermore, we believe many other grocers are following KR’s lead on pricing. As we survey the grocery
landscape we see: a) Ahold’s limited overlap with WMT in its key markets (so can follow KR’s lead), b) Albertsons has
highlighted Fresh as a meaningful competitive advantage, c) Publix having never really been focused on price
competition, d) ~30% of grocery retail consisting of struggling grocers who would welcome price increases, and e)
medium size/larger grocers who are likely eager to take price given the low inflation environment and the significant
investments necessary to fund e-commerce development.
The notion that competitors have sustainable pricing power in WMT’s markets due to an “edge” in fresh is
questionable, to say the least. In recent years WMT went through a period when it made ample strides in fresh
(particularly in produce) and narrowed the gap vs. competitors. Going forward, progress will be driven by ongoing
initiatives, such as the latest improvements in supply chain and presentation (including Produce 2.0). We don’t believe
WMT’s progress is being fully appreciated by competitors – the argument that WMT’s quality is vastly inferior
and, as a result, competitors can sustain price increases in fresh categories does not hold water, in our view. As such, we
believe WMT is in an increasingly favorable position for out-sized share gains as price gaps widen vs. competitors.
With respect to convenience/shopping experience, we expect to hear more on Tuesday about continued
enhancements to the grocery e-commerce platform. WMT has aggressively pursued its U.S. rollout of grocery e-
commerce Pick-Up (in ~3,100 locations) and Delivery (in 1,600 locations) – but the next leg of growth should increasingly
be driven by higher adoption rates and the addition of general merchandise SKUs to same-day grocery fulfillment. Recall
that WMT expects to eventually merge its 'Blue' and 'Orange' apps (this is not new but timeline remains unknown) as it
builds its general merchandise offering to provide a more seamless customer experience. Today, WMT’s omni-channel
grocery experience is unmatched. AMZN continues to be on everyone’s radar, but the reality is that AMZN
has not done a whole lot with Whole Foods in grocery thus far. While Amazon Fresh is incrementally more

competitive after dropping its delivery fees for Prime members, WMT’s EDLP pricing (Amazon Fresh priced at a premium
in our studies, even after delivery fees), store pick-up options, and availability give WMT a significant edge.
Key Investor Concern #4: Several of WMT’s culture carriers have departed, resulting in a talent void at the
highest levels of the organization.
In the wake of Greg Foran’s and Steve Bratspies’s departures, we believe some investors are concerned about a U.S.
leadership void and/or a meaningful change in the culture which has allowed WMT to perform well in recent years.
Additionally, speculation about the role, and potential departure of CEO of U.S. E-commerce, Marc Lore has also been a
concern.
Our rebuttal: WMT’s talent bench is deep and its culture will continue to evolve under the stewardship of Walmart Inc.
CEO Doug McMillon and new U.S. CEO John Furner. It is unlikely U.S. E-commerce CEO Marc Lore would leave until his
WMT shares from the Jet.com deal vest in 2021.
In our view, WMT has a deep bench of talent and has been embracing an innovation culture under Doug
McMillon’s leadership. With new leadership in the U.S. (John Furner, Scott McCall as Chief Merchant, and Dacona Smith
as U.S. COO) and added leadership in digital (Chief Technology Officer Suresh Kumar) we expect WMT to continue to
evolve into a more technology-centric, nimble, and integrated organization.
WMT has not been afraid of change or innovation as it has evolved over the years to serve the customer. WMT’s
adaptability and openness to change have been meaningful differentiating factors that, under Doug McMillon’s
leadership, are ingrained in the culture of the company and are likely to endure in the future. Indeed, WMT continues to
embrace more risk-taking and the development of organizational agility/speed. Notably, while much
technological/process change will result in an evolution in the role of store associates, WMT has been clear that store
labor hours saved will be invested back into driving an improved customer experience.
Separately, while there seems to always be some speculation about the role (and potential departure) of CEO of U.S. E-
commerce, Marc Lore, we believe the risk has declined with the departure of Greg Foran. Additionally, it is important to
note that only slightly over 50% of the WMT shares Mr. Lore was paid as part of the Jet.com deal have vested and won’t
completely vest until September 2021.
Other Topics of Investor Focus:
Walmart Health: The addition of the Walmart Health center remains one of the most unique opportunities
WMT is pursuing as it continually seeks to evolve the supercenter. Management has been encouraged by
customer uptake at the first center in Dallas, Georgia (opened last September) thus far, and recently opened a second
location in nearby Calhoun, Georgia. While the Health center’s steep discounts for basic services have resulted in dilution
concerns amongst investors, management has stressed that they do not view the Health initiative as a “non-
profit” effort and is very focused on driving profitability, regularly monitoring performance vs. expectations and
working to optimize offerings/layout as more openings are planned going forward.
WMT’s goal of improving access to basic/preventative healthcare at affordable prices provides another potential traffic
driver for the supercenter by differentiating its value proposition vs. competitors. We continue to view the Health
initiative as revolutionary, although still in early innings, and expect management to provide further customer feedback
regarding the 2 locations at the Analyst Day as well as more granular color on expansion plans and profitability. For
comprehensive details regarding the Health center’s offerings, see our 9/16/19 report from our visit during the grand
opening of the Health center in Dallas, Georgia here.
The Media Opportunity: WMT’s media/advertising business remains one of the alternative revenue streams
that presents a compelling opportunity for WMT given its scale, private-label expertise, and extensive vendor
relationships. While WMT has not disclosed the exact size of the business, management has implied that the business is
not insignificant and presents an area for potential progress. WMT, consistent with its plans to scale other parts of the
business, seeks to balance the growth while also ensuring that the customer experience does not suffer in any way.
Nevertheless, details on a strategic plan to grow the business have been scarce and we look for
incremental color regarding the monetization of WMT’s data assets at the Analyst Day. As WMT continues to
grow its omni-channel offerings, we expect the company to better leverage its rich consumer data and exhibit a more
focused approach to advertising growth similar to competitors such as KR.

Specific thoughts on 4Q:
We are forecasting 4Q20 EPS of $1.45, in-line with consensus. Performance in the core U.S. business will continue to be
the focal point as WMT has delivered four consecutive quarters of ~4%+ growth in operating profit. Following growth of
5.5%, 4.0%, and 6.1% in each of the first three quarters this year respectively, we are forecasting 4.3% growth in 4Q
reflecting 2.7% comps and 10 bps of EBIT margin expansion. The Street is forecasting ~5% U.S. EBIT growth reflecting a
2.7% comp and roughly 10 bps of EBIT margin expansion. We believe comp expectations are lower than what consensus
implies given negative read-throughs from TGT’s soft holiday sales, the lapping of the 40 bps benefit from SNAP pull-
forward in 4Q19, and recent management changes that investors have deduced were the result of weaker than expected
performance in the quarter. Nevertheless, we believe that strong momentum will continue despite the near-term noise
given core share gains, ongoing merchandising and store experience improvements, price investments, and a generally
favorable macro backdrop.
What Matters to Us Most:
· Comps and traffic in F4Q20, including the contribution from e-commerce.
· The health of WMT’s core customer and the impact of tariffs.
· FY20 guidance.
· U.S. gross margin and ability to leverage SG&A.
· E-commerce growth and drivers.
· Flipkart sales growth and operating losses.
· Cost and price inflation environment.
· Pricing gaps to competitors.
· E-commerce grocery trends.
Progress on Fresh initiatives.
Tailwinds:
· Share gains and traffic growth driven by price investments and continued e-commerce traction
· E-commerce to remain strong supported by: 1) the rollout of Grocery Pickup locations, 2) the expansion of same day
grocery delivery to more markets, 3) brand additions and an improved assortment on marketplace, and 4) expansion
of NextDay delivery to 75% of the U.S.
· Comps at Sam’s Club are benefiting from Club Pickup and delivery.
· Continued execution of share repurchase program.
· Online grocery and e-commerce is contributing to average ticket growth.
· Continued strength in U.S. consumer spending.
· The dilutive Flipkart acquisition will be completely lapped by 4Q20.
Potential share gains in grocery from price increases by competitors.
Headwinds:
· Price investments at Walmart U.S. have not slowed and these are pressuring the gross margin.
· E-commerce mix is negatively impacting margin %.
· Potential expense pressure from wages and tariffs on imported products from China.
· Dilution from Flipkart business in India in 3Q.
· Softer environment in the UK due to the Brexit tensions.
· A shorter holiday season despite WMT’s relatively insulated risk from its significant digital presence compared to
other retailers
· Negative read-throughs from TGT’s holiday performance and mixed industry data point to potential weakness in
electronics
Slight negative FX impact of $100 million in 4Q20
Guidance:
---- FY2020 ----
· Adjusted EPS: Slight increase compared with FY19 adjusted EPS, and an increase of +HSD percent compared with
FY19 adjusted EPS excluding Flipkart - reflects Flipkart dilution of ~$0.40-$0.45 excluding related interest cost.
· Walmart U.S. comp sales excluding fuel: towards the upper-end of +2.5%-3.0%

· Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales growth of ~35% y/y
· Sam’s Club comp sales excluding fuel: ~+1.0% and ~+3.0% excluding Fuel & tobacco
· International net sales growth: +3.0%-4.0% on a constant currency basis (including Flipkart)
· Consolidated net sales growth: ~+3.0% on a constant currency basis
· Expense leverage: at least 20 bps
· Consolidated EBIT: Slight decrease to slight increase including Flipkart, and increase of +L-MSD percent excluding
Flipkart
· Effective tax rate: between 25.0% and 25.5%
· Capital expenditures: ~$11 billion
· Grocery Pickup and Delivery: ~3,100 pickup and ~1,600 grocery delivery locations by YE
· Real estate: Walmart U.S. to open <10 stores and Walmart International to open >300 new stores primarily at
Walmex and in China

Mentioned Stocks (Ticker, Date, Price)
Walmart Inc. (WMT, 11-Feb-2020, USD 115.40), Overweight/Neutral, A/CD/CE/D/J/K/L/M/N/R
Valuation Methodology: Our $135 price target is based on a ~12.3x EV/EBITDA multiple and FY21 EBITDA of $34.3
billion.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: We believe
the long-term risks for Walmart include: (1) the challenges associated with managing increasingly vast and complex
operations, (2) the growing contribution of the lower-margin food business to the overall merchandise mix, (3) the
ability to acquire and successfully integrate assets abroad, (4) the proficiency with which the company adapts its store
formats to the various economic and cultural environments in international markets, and (5) ability to profitably grow
its e-commerce business. Our earnings forecast and investment thesis for Walmart are subject to such factors as cost
of goods, consumer spending and debt levels, currency fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, store expansion plans,
and variability in comparable store sales.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or
Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are
deemed to be in the same industry (“the industry coverage universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a
particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.

In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as
Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the
equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of
all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target:
Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's
expectation of where the stock will trade in the next 12 months. Upside/downside scenarios, where provided,
represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period.
Top Picks:
Barclays Equity Research's ""Top Picks"" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry
(as defined by the relevant ""industry coverage universe""), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that
industry. Barclays Equity Research publishes ""Top Picks"" reports every quarter and analysts may also publish intra-
quarter changes to their Top Picks, as necessary. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their
published research in addition to their Top Pick, there can only be one ""Top Pick"" for each industry. To view the current

pressure; (3) component pricing volatility and gross margin impacts; (4) Supply chain disruptions; (5)
Legal disputes; and (6) Execution missteps.
Investment Thesis
Our Overweight rating reflects our believe that: 1) Apple's competitive differentiation and overall
deepening product / services portfolio will create sustainable brand loyalty, 2) Apple's strong balance
sheet and sustainable FCF generation; continually funding a strong capital return strategy, and 3) Apple's
expanding recurring paid subscriber base.

Earnings Release Details:
Tuesday, August 18
7:00AM ET Press Release; 8:00AM ET Earnings Call
The WMT debate ahead of next Tuesday’s earnings is shaping up to be one of the more controversial in recent memory. A
confluence of factors has left investors increasingly skittish about what we will hear from WMT on Tuesday, with the focus
revolving around market share loss concerns. As discussed herein, while indications are that WMT lost share in 2Q – our
proprietary analysis using Numerator implies customer behavior has resulted in “a tale of two halves” so far this year. In
other words, WMT gained a lot of share early on in the pandemic in 1Q and lost share in 2Q, but we believe this is
evidence of volatile shopping patterns (for better or worse) that are transitory in our view. Recent share loss is easily
(and likely) explainable because there is a convenience factor in this new environment, but the situation is probably
transitory in nature. The point is, WMT didn’t all of a sudden stray from their core culture and strengths, nor did
competitors markedly improve their own operations over the last few months – this share shift is simply a function of
erratic consumer behavior, price increases at conventionals, and more disposable income (given very few other spending
outlets such as travel, entertainment, restaurants etc…) which we think will ultimately normalize.
More importantly, when the dust settles, we see nothing that threatens WMT’s standing as a long-term winner in the
space. Indeed, we stand by our contention that WMT continues to do what is fundamentally right for the business (not
raising prices during a pandemic), and believe that concerns about near-term market share are overdone and will
ultimately prove irrelevant as we begin to emerge to a new normal. Separately, Walmart’s M.O. is to be there for the
customer at all times, so we would not rule out additional price investments in these times to even further widen the gap
with the conventional competitor set. We have many examples of how WMT has lowered prices in the past to take
advantage of market share opportunities and we would not be surprised whatsoever if WMT pulls this “price investment”
trigger once again in this most unique environment. As we have said in the past, all the best retailers – grocery,
discretionary etc. – invest in price at the most opportune moments when they are in position to do so. WMT is in position
to do so, especially when local and regional players are raising prices to drive margins. We believe this is the most
opportune time and moment for WMT to invest again in price to take share.
In this note, we address several of the key topics/concerns driving WMT sentiment today including: 1) the
debate around recent market share data-points and comps; 2) margin considerations; 3) WMT’s restructuring
actions/management changes at the corporate level; and 4) recent e-commerce developments, including the
“Walmart+” initiative and news of a small Instacart pilot.
Key Topic #1 - The Market Share/Comp Debate: This is the most important topic of conversation for the stock, as
concerns that WMT is under-comping the competition (as a result of COVID) have emerged. 3 main funnels of information
have fueled concerns: 1) scanner data have reflected lagging sales for the mass channel vs. the conventional channel
since the COVID outbreak; 2) several of WMT’s vendors – POST and BRBR for example - have discussed Mass channel
share loss; and 3) credit card data appears to have been soft recently (per our conversations with investors – we don’t

actually have access to this data). We discuss these data points in more detail, but have also looked to Numerator for
additional analysis.
Numerator data, which includes e-commerce, shows a “tale of two halves” so far this year in aggregate for
consumables/staples categories (Grocery, Health & Beauty, Household, Baby, and Pet), but especially for WMT. Note this
data is January 1st through June 30th so it is not apples to apples for any of these retailers’ fiscal quarters, meaning the
data does not capture July, a month we believe consumer behavior likely returned to a more normalized
pattern. In calendar 2Q20 (Figure 1), WMT lost 3.1% of its market share when we include AMZN in the dataset and lost
2.2% of its market share when we exclude AMZN.
This was a meaningful reversal from calendar 1Q20 (Figure 2) when WMT had considerable share gains of 4.4%, and
4.7% including and excluding AMZN, or 107 bps and 117 bps including and excluding AMZN respectively. We believe the
convenience factor of going to a local grocer instead of a potentially further away more crowded big box may have
contributed to this share loss in 2Q. Additionally as this is $ market share, the 2Q share loss could also be very much
explained by WMT’s EDLP strategy – as competitors ceased all promotions and benefited from higher throughput, while
WMT obviously retained its EDLP go-to-market strategy. We do, however, acknowledge the gap to TGT is surprising – and
will look for more color on this when both companies report next week.

As you can see in the consolidated calendar 1H20 Figure 3 below, WMT’s share levels increased 1.2% excluding AMZN
and increased 0.6% including AMZN. Looking at changes in bps share, excluding AMZN, WMT increased its aggregate
share in these categories by 32 bps in 1H20, but gains were a more muted 15bp when we include AMZN. Excluding
AMZN, we acknowledge share gains were more muted than TGT, DG and Publix, and also acknowledge the bricks and
mortar Walmart lost share (made up for by e-commerce), but in this omni-channel world, we care about total share –
especially for Walmart given its dominance in pick-up and on-line. We would also highlight the fact that the Kroger
banner lost more share than Walmart – although in the bricks and mortar world – this was made up for by the other
banners. Excluding AMZN, ACI gained less share than WMT and KR – at only 13bp, although as a % change in total share,
ACI outpaced WMT. Based on our analysis – at ACI, many banners lost share including: Jewel-Osco, ACME, and Shaws.
While the 2Q20 share loss for WMT could worry some, we see it as transitory and point to 1Q20 (and overall 1H20) share
gains as proof that WMT’s long term strategy of “being there for the customer” will win in the end.

With respect to the scanner data, as you can see in Figure 4 below, Nielsen store scanner data does show $
sales growth in the conventional “Food” channel (conventional grocers) outpacing the “Other” Multi-Outlet Stores (i.e.
Mass, Club, Dollar etc.). The y/y dollar sales growth gap between these channels is ~12pts since the outbreak of COVID-
19. However, we believe two nuances in interpreting the data help explain some of the gap. First, we believe
that conventional grocers have pulled promotions more significantly and/or taken more pricing during the pandemic,
while WMT has been investing in price despite inflation – so higher prices by conventionals is a factor, in our view.
Second, price increases at conventional combined with higher utilization (i.e. the assets were previously very
underutilized), by definition will lead to higher dollar growth at the conventions. Third, the Nielsen data does not capture
e-commerce delivery data for retailers such as Walmart – and e-commerce is a significant growth driver for WMT, rising
dramatically during the pandemic.

Source: Nielsen
To be clear, we acknowledge the validity of some industry data-points, as there are logical reasons why WMT sales may
be lagging other grocers and some of WMT’s vendors have discussed share loss. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that
there are a lot of poorly managed, low productivity, grocery retailers that likely benefited significantly
more from COVID-related demand. Simply by virtue of carrying highly demanded goods in a potentially less
frequented (and perhaps closer geographically in some cases) format, these grocers may have increased sales at a very
high rate off a low sales productivity base. Along these lines, given WMT’s price leadership, the rest of the industry has
much more to gain from the consumer becoming much less price sensitive (given the drop in FAFH/travel spend and
fiscal stimulus). None of this is sustainable, however, in our view.
To conclude: the evidence on market share reflects losses for WMT in 2Q, but what we are sure of is that WMT’s
competitors did not improve as merchants/operators so markedly overnight. Nor will the consumers’ current
disregard for price and/or the potential fear of contagion in big box stores last very long (if that is, in fact, what we are
witnessing). As noted above, Figure 3 shows the “Other” Multi-Outlet Stores (i.e. Mass, Club, Dollar etc.) growth lagging
during COVID, but look at the consistent share gains in the “Other” channel pre-COVID dating back to 2016. We think
such multi-year gains in the mass channel (i.e. WMT) speak to the enduring strength of WMT’s model. Conversely,
inferior retailers will lose any near-term share gains quickly, while retailers (such as WMT) that provide value and
convenience (with a superior omni-channel platform) while positively engaging customers/communities will benefit from
stickier sales growth. That customer stickiness is the post-COVID prize, in our view.
We are forecasting 2Q U.S. comps of 5% vs. consensus of 5.7%, industry data points seem to range from
4.5%-8%. Recall that WMT said it had a “solid” start to May driven by fiscal stimulus. General merchandise categories
were likely boosted by government payments, while grocery clearly remained elevated industry-wide given the shift to
FAFH to FAH, as reads from KR and ACI suggest high teens May/June industry growth. Notably, we look forward to more
color on traffic/ticket trends.
Key Topic #2 - Margin Considerations: Investments and COVID-19 related costs will continue to limit flow-through in
the near-term. We expect margins to once again be pressured in 2Q given a) “hero pay” in the U.S., b) continued
(although lessening) product mix headwinds, c) the ongoing shift to e-commerce, d) price investments despite cost
inflation (a move which will be “remembered” by customers, in our view), as well as e) weakness in International. As a
reminder, most of Walmart’s International markets lag by 1 month from a reporting perspective so April, May, and June
results will be factored into 2Q results vs. May, June, and July for the U.S. and Canada. April was an especially difficult
month for International markets, which, for example, saw COVID related store closures in South Africa, and severe
government limitations on what was allowed to be sold in India. As stated earlier, we wouldn’t rule out a more aggressive
approach to pricing going forward to even further widen the gap with conventionals.
With respect to COVID related costs in more detail, management noted that it would be reasonable to assume 2Q costs
similar to 1Q’s ~$900M in incremental costs ($670M in the U.S.). While WMT noted that its second round of associate
bonuses of ~$370M would impact 2Q, in late July, the company then announced another $428M in bonuses that will be
paid out on Aug. 20th. It is unclear if these bonus payments will be expensed on the P&L in 2Q or 3Q, although we
believe our modeled y/y SG&A increase of $1.2B in 2Q has enough cushion to absorb the third payment.
The sustainability of high labor costs will be a topic of focus on the call, but investors will also focus on the
degree to which WMT has improved efficiencies/operations. As we explain in more detail below, recent news that
WMT is eliminating “hundreds” of jobs (in store planning, logistics, and duplicative merchandising) reflects the ongoing
optimization of the business under U.S. CEO John Furner. Further, improvements in merchandise mix, 3P growth, and
sales leverage should drive better e-commerce profitability. We note, although WMT did eliminate jobs at corporate, the
company has also hired ~400k employees at the store level during the pandemic to meet higher demand.
Overall, we are forecasting a 46 bps drop in Walmart Inc. operating margins in 2Q, including a 30 bps
decline in the U.S. Consensus is at down 30 bps.
Key Topic #3 - Recent Restructuring Actions/Leadership Changes: As alluded to above, recently made some
changes at the corporate level to eliminate redundant or less productive positions. Some investors have read these
moves as a cost cutting exercise in the face of slowing sales growth. We believe the moves reflect the continued
optimization of WMT’s business and is a natural extension of U.S. CEO John Furner’s desire to create a
more agile, efficient, and nimble organization. We do not believe that the restructuring has anything to do with

recent sales trends or, more specifically, the grocery share loss narrative described above. Many of the job cuts are
meant to reduce redundancies, specifically as a result of the combination of Walmart’s physical and digital support
operations, which was already discussed/announced, but hadn’t yet been acted on in terms of consolidating
roles/functions – largely because COVID meant “all hands on deck” for the better part of the last 4 months.
With respect to leadership, we believe the recent departure of Sean Slovenski, former SVP of Health and
Wellness at Walmart U.S. is also an extension of U.S. CEO John Furner putting his imprint on the business,
specifically the health and wellness opportunity. Mr. Slovenski’s departure has been cited by some as a sign of
turmoil at WMT in the midst of slowing sales/share loss. However, we suspect the change may be a function of Mr.
Furner’s recognition of the importance of the opportunity for WMT and his desire to place a leader in that position that
more closely reflects his vision for Walmart Health.
Key Topic #4 – Recent E-commerce Developments: Two important topics are top of mind regarding Walmart’s e-
commerce business and will likely garner attention on the 2Q call: 1) news about the “Walmart+” rollout, and 2) news
about the recently announced pilot with Instacart.
With respect to “Walmart+”: press reports have surfaced that Walmart planned to launch the “Walmart+” program in
July – a program which would enable unlimited same day delivery of grocery and other goods from Supercenters along
with other perks, including fuel discounts, early access to product deals, some access to express 2-hour delivery, and
video entertainment services for an annual membership fee of $98.
We believe the program has been in the budget for some time now and see this as the natural progression of the
Walmart Delivery Unlimited program which WMT began testing in November of last year. Delivery Unlimited was being
tested in ~1,600 stores covering ~50% of the population. According to press reports, while COVID pushed back the initial
launch timeframe of March/April into July, the press has speculated the launch has been delayed again, fueling
speculation about soft U.S. sales trends causing the delay. We believe any delay is more a function of the need to
continue to navigate the ongoing COVID crisis, and not related to top line trends. More importantly,
traction with the subscription model could go a long way in extending the moat around Walmart’s business
given WMT’s positioning in grocery and unique assets. We are hopeful more details will emerge on the 2Q call, but
also suspect a delay – if there even is one – could be tied to Instacart – even though it is apparently only in test mode.
With respect to Instacart: On August 11th, CNBC reported (and quoted an “Instacart spokesperson”) that Walmart
would launch a pilot with Instacart in 4 markets across California and Oklahoma. On one hand, since 2015, WMT has
proven its culture is always open to change – but before any final decision is made, WMT follows a disciplined and
deliberate testing strategy. This could be just a test. On the other hand, we were surprised. While we are not privy to
any details regarding the test (data sharing, fee structure, for example), we have for some time applauded WMT for
building out its own end-to-end solution vs. most other grocers’ reliance on Instacart. Our position is that retailers who
have the scale to build out their own end-to-end e-commerce solution should do so given the benefits from data assets,
inventory visibility, customer/vendor relationships, and eventual cost optimization. As such, it is unclear to us what to
make of this test and hope to learn more on Tuesday.
Ahead of the Quarter:
We are forecasting 2Q21 EPS of $1.16 vs. consensus of $1.25. WMT has pivoted its focus on making the necessary
investments to serve its customers and workers during the pandemic. Gross margin, incremental COVID-19 related costs,
and overall top-line flow through will be top of mind as investors are looking to gauge the stickiness of costs and the
impact to profitability going forward. The Street is forecasting a gross margin of 24.6%, a 30bp decrease y/y likely due to
mix shift, more or less consistent with our projections of a 20bp decline. Tailwinds to gross margin to offset mix may
include a less promotional environment and less shrink. SG&A costs are likely to be substantial given WMT’s investment
in additional labor and cleaning costs. Consensus estimates overall SG&A, including both labor and other incremental
COVID-19 related costs, to be ~$27.6B vs our ~$28.0B forecast. Despite the near-term noise on cost, we believe WMT
has reacted quickly to serve customer needs and will continue its strong momentum.
What Matters to Us Most:
· QTD comps and traffic by category, including the contribution from e-commerce.
· The health of WMT’s core customer and the impact of COVID-19.
· Any color on FY21 outlook.
· Specifics regarding ongoing incremental SG&A costs related to COVID-19.
· Puts and takes on gross margin.
· E-commerce growth and drivers.

· Government stimulus and SNAP impact on sales.
· Flipkart sales growth and operating losses.
· Cost and price inflation environment.
· Pricing gaps/promotional activity vs competitors.
· E-commerce grocery trends.
· Color on Express Delivery reception and expansion plans.
· Color on WMT+ and rollout plans.
· Color on the Instacart test
· Update on capital allocation/strategic investment priorities
Tailwinds:
· Share gains and traffic growth driven by investments and continued e-commerce traction
· Much lower shrink in fresh
· E-commerce to remain strong supported by: 1) the rollout of Grocery Pickup locations, 2) the expansion of same day
grocery delivery to more markets, 3) brand additions and an improved assortment on marketplace, 4) expansion of
NextDay delivery to 75% of the U.S, 5) launch of Express Delivery.
· Online grocery and e-commerce is contributing to average ticket growth.
· Potential share gains as customers look to consolidate shopping trips in stores that can fulfill all needs.
· Increase in spending due to government stimulus and SNAP increase.
Headwinds:
· Unfavorable mix shift to lower margin essential goods.
· Substantial SG&A expenses related to COVID-19.
· E-commerce mix impact to margin.
· Uncertain macro environment.
Guidance: Withdrawn due to COVID-19 uncertainty

Walmart Inc. (WMT, 13-Aug-2020, USD 131.85), Overweight/Neutral, A/CD/CE/D/J/K/L/M/N
Valuation Methodology: Our $140 price target is based on a ~12x EV/EBITDA multiple and FY22 EBITDA of $35.1

billion.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: We believe
the long-term risks for Walmart include: (1) the challenges associated with managing increasingly vast and complex
operations, (2) the growing contribution of the lower-margin food business to the overall merchandise mix, (3) the
ability to acquire and successfully integrate assets abroad, (4) the proficiency with which the company adapts its store
formats to the various economic and cultural environments in international markets, and (5) ability to profitably grow
its e-commerce business. Our earnings forecast and investment thesis for Walmart are subject to such factors as cost
of goods, consumer spending and debt levels, currency fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, store expansion plans,
and variability in comparable store sales.

Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are
deemed to be in the same industry (“the industry coverage universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a
particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as
Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the

all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target:
Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's

represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period.
Top Picks:
Barclays Equity Research's ""Top Picks"" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry
(as defined by the relevant ""industry coverage universe""), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that
industry. Barclays Equity Research publishes ""Top Picks"" reports every quarter and analysts may also publish intra-
quarter changes to their Top Picks, as necessary. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their
published research in addition to their Top Pick, there can only be one ""Top Pick"" for each industry. To view the current

Update On Amazon India
Amazon’s India e-commerce growth is returning to a more normalized level, a tad below pre-
pandemic rates, after a couple years of hyper-growth through the pandemic period. We
estimate that the overall industry is around $75B in GMV (the B2C parts of India e-commerce)
and is growing in the mid-20%’s in 2022. The average consumer in India spends around $100
annual on purchases, this contrasts with closer to $3,000 in the US and UK and $1,500 for
Germany, France and Japan.

In Figure 3 below, we attempt to size Amazon’s India franchise by segment. B2C is the best
proxy for Amazon’s consumer facing business and is growing 32% through March-2022,
similar to what we observe in Flipkart’s tax filings (albeit the latter being larger base after
consolidating Myntra/Jabong a few years ago). JioMart is likely taking some share from the
two larger players owing to its foothold in higher frequency grocery and with an extensive
retail brick-and-mortar footprint (Reliance), but fair to say the overall industry was growing
in the 30%-35% range through March-2022 and has decelerated a bit since.
AMZN’s B2B seems to be rebounding after a few years of regulatory blowback. Recall
following the Feb-2019 regulatory changes, Amazon likely deconsolidated or restructured its
B2B business in India (B2B is where Amazon would sell products on a wholesale basis into
third party sellers, who would subsequently sell these items through Amazon’s website. The
company had to wind down ownership in two prominent sellers Cloudtail and Appario, and
eliminate exclusives and extensive discounting).
AWS India is growing at the fastest growth cadence we’ve observed since 2019, up 65% y/y
through March-2022, the biggest positive in this country-update.

Amazon India continues to be one of the fastest growing geographies for Amazon globally,
up ~30x since FY15. The country should maintain its growth tailwinds as e-commerce
penetration remains low (~8%), and overall retail growth remains high, expected to be 26%
in calendar year 2022 (via eMarketer).

For FY22 (ended 3/22), India grew to 4.4% of Amazon’s International Retail revenue up from
3.5% in FY21. This figure had been north of 5% historically prior to the change in the
wholesale business model.
India OI has remained around -$1B from FY18-FY22, despite revenue growing 77% in the
same period. This implies a roughly 20pt margin improvement, from -33% in FY18 to -14%
in FY22. The important take is that India losses appear to be stable, and the recent downtick
in international retail operating loss is likely as much a function of reduced margins in the
bigger mature markets like UK, DE and JPN, and less so from India turning meaningfully lower.
We assume that the mature international markets are facing a lot of the same inflationary
pressures as North America retail, especially across DE and UK, two of the profit centers for
Amazon International historically.

Total estimated GMV for the year ended March ’22 decelerated 12 points, while revenue
accelerated 2 points, attributable to AWS mostly. Overall growth rates should continue to
moderate into calendar 2023, reflecting some incremental macro pressure on the consumer
but broadly strong trends following the pandemic hyper-growth period. The B2C segment of
AMZN’s India business posted 32% y/y ex-FX growth, similar to what we observed from
Flipkart over the same period. The Prime offering has helped Amazon build a wide audience
in India with 85% of customers and 50% of sellers coming from tier-2 and tier-3 towns.
Amazon has stated its goal is to drive $20B of cumulative GMV by 2025 through small sellers
in India exporting to buyers across its global marketplace, a nice differentiator vs. some
domestic-only competition. The company has recently built out its offering to include
logistics both in country and globally, similar to the approach in many of the large Amazon
retail geos. AMZN India’s B2B segment rebounded in the recent year ended March ’22
following several years of declines due to the regulatory changes noted above.

AWS seems to be hitting its stride, with growth re-accelerating to 65% y/y growth (up from
+29% in FY21) and generating $1.2bn in revenue. We would estimate the growth rate may
have come down a bit in subsequent months consistent with the economic and pricing
pressure Amazon described on its 3Q22 conference call. Amazon Pay growth continues to
grow nicely but decelerated once again for the year ended March ’22 to 16% y/y.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage
universe"").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative
(see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully
read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.

Valuation Methodology: We value shares of AMZN using a sum-of-the-parts methodology for its retail and AWS businesses. Our valuation of
AMZN's retail business is based on an average of 20x EBITDA and 2x revenue using our FY23 estimates; while we value AWS using 6x our FY23
revenue estimates. Our resulting price target is $140.

Barclays | Amazon.com, Inc.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Downside risks in the short term that could
negatively impact our model and consensus estimates include: 1) greater-than-expected investment levels in retail, and hence lower than expected
CSOI margins, over a more drawn-out period; 2) AWS missing consensus estimates from increased competition or simply because the Street over-
estimated the pace at which on-premise workloads shift to the cloud. We'd put a 40% probability on either of these two risks playing out in 2017
(recall that both played out in 4Q16 and it didn't seem to matter for shares, which are up almost 4.5% from the day after the print (vs S&P up
2%)).
Longer-term risks include the highly competitive ecommerce landscape, increasing shipping costs from same and next-day delivery, which could
be a drag on margins, security breaches or frequent downtime in the AWS business which could slow down public cloud adoption, or execution
missteps that could slow growth of the retail business.

While this had been a contested perspective, we have long viewed KO as one of the Unchanged

2020, we find it apt to consider our valuation methodology in the context of the market’s
enthusiasm for P&G, the other recent mega-cap Staples turnaround story. Here we would
note that KO’s estimated organic revenue and earnings growth profile is favorable to that of
P&G in C20 and we would argue that “available” top-line growth longer term vis a vis their
individual category and geographic footprints also bears the same relationship. As such,
while KO is trading at a premium to P&G (+17% premium to Large-Cap Staples vs. P&G and
+10%), we see reason for this differential to remain going forward. We are raising our PT to
$63 reflecting a +25% premium to Large-Cap Staples on our C20 EPS estimate of $2.26. Our
prior $58 PT reflected a +20% premium to Large-Cap Staples on the same EPS estimate.
It Had to Be Good to Get Where It Is
While this has been a contested perspective, we have long viewed KO as one of the most
compelling fundamental stories in Staples. It’s been a long and bumpy road for the KO
investment case as the company has struggled to marry what has been an impressive top-
line turnaround with commensurate earnings growth and cash flow generation. Beyond the
face value challenge of this dynamic, the lack of flow-through furthered the Consensus
concern that the pursuit of becoming a “total beverage company” would be untenably
dilutive to profitability. Our view has been that the company has a well architected plan for
working through mix shift, not to mention that it is concurrently increasing the profitability
of the legacy CSD portfolio (05/17/18: Upgrade to OW - A Sparkling
Transformation).Likewise, we have done a deep dive into the factors that have limited KO’s
free cash conversion rate and have highlighted progress on this front as being critical to
further share price outperformance (05/16/19 - Go With the Free Cash Flow), and we think
yesterday’s move (KO +3% vs. XLP +1%) bears this out
With the 2020 outlook calling for the first time in nearly a decade that KO should see a
trifecta of solid top-line growth, earnings growth and free cash flow conversion, we
expect investor enthusiasm for the transformation underway at KO to grow to match
ours from here. Importantly, while guidance calls for +5% organic revenue growth, we find
ourselves comfortably rounding up to yet another year of +6% growth in our model. To be
sure, 2020 is not devoid of macroeconomic pressure (Argentina is likely to continue to
deteriorate, India may or may not be softening and the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus
outbreak in China is still unknown). That said, we see room for innovation and better
execution to offset headwinds to growth. To this point, we would expect Latin America to
continue to benefit from revenue growth management initiatives including price/pack
development in Mexico and cooler investments in Brazil through 2020. Additionally, from an
innovation standpoint, we understand Coke Plus Coffee to be tracking ahead of
expectations and would expect the continued rollout/reformulation of Coke Energy and the
launch of AHA Sparkling in the U.S. to be accretive to growth.
On the cash flow side, we would highlight that work to address these line items is yielding
results earlier than expected with free cash flow for the year up +40% YoY to $8.4 billion,
~$4 billion higher than management’s initial forecasts and reflecting a conversion rate of
96% (vs. just 67% at the end of 2018). Last year’s cash flow did benefit from a special
dividend and a transition tax payment, so the company has suggested that the true run-rate
is more in mid-to-high 80% range, matching the ~85% implied guidance for 2020.
Changes to the model. We are taking up our estimates for C20 organic sales growth to
+5.8% (vs. +5.2% prior) driven largely by our more favourable expectations for price/mix in
31 January 2020 3

Barclays | The Coca-Cola Company
Latin America (organic now +11% vs. +8% prior) as KO cycles through price/pack
adjustments. We expect currency to shave ~100 bps off top-line and the Fairlife acquisition
to add ~50 bps to top-line growth, bringing our all-in revenue growth outlook to up ~5%.
We assume gross margins are down ~20 bps and that operating profit grows +6.5% which
we note is above the high end of management guidance for +5-6% operating profit growth
given stronger top-line performance (e.g. +8% constant currency, less a 2-3% FX
headwind). All in, while we are modeling a YoY a step-up in minority interest (linked to
CCBA) we expect this to be offset by other below-the-line items leaving our full-year EPS
estimate up +7% to $2.26.

IT Hardware
China May Handsets – Below Seasonal Overall; iPhone Strong
May Below Seasonal Growth M/M
Weaker seasonality: China’s MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology) released monthly handset data for May. Following a weaker
April, China May smartphone shipments declined 16% sequentially, 18% below the 3-year average growth of +2% for the month (2017-2019, to
exclude the Covid-19 impact in 2020). Monthly units for total handset were down 32% Y/Y, following a 32% Y/Y decline in April and continued the
downdraft trend we saw in much of 2020. We recently did a round of channel checks with industry participants in China and highlighted
the weak May Day holiday sales with iPhone holding in better on component supply than the Chinese vendors (see our channel checks
note IT Hardware: China Smartphone Checks, 6/1/2021).
5G penetration down: 5G penetration sharply declined 520bps in May to 72.6%, a reversal from the steady 5G rise over the last 12 months, where
the penetration was only 46% a year ago. Our channel partners have indicated 5G saturation in our recent checks, and this seems to be
playing out. 5G phones have represented ~73% of new models introduced YTD in 2021, compared to an average of ~53% for the full year 2020. At
26% of new models introduced YTD, 4G shipments increased by 5% sequentially, but down nearly 65% Y/Y.
AAPL Implications
700bps Gain in May Market Share for iPhone: We estimate 3.5M iPhone shipments in the month of May, up 1M vs. April’s seasonally strong 2.5M
level. This was up 41% sequentially, vs. normal May seasonal growth level of +55% M/M for 2017-2019. We estimate that iPhone units were up 38%
Y/Y in May, a positive reversal vs. a 24% Y/Y decline in April. We also estimate that iPhone market share rose to 16% in the month, 700 bps above the
April level of 9%, still a decline from the 20% level seen in Q420, however, an improvement above the 11% level in Q121 and 12% average for 2020.
From our conversations with Chinese channel partners, we believe Apple is better positioned to deal with the component shortage
issues than the Chinese. Our recent analysis on Taiwan Suppliers also indicated better June-Q for AAPL (AAPL Supplier Tracker - May Sub-
Seasonal But Q2 Looks Good, 6/14/2021).
The iPhone 12 cycle has been strong. We expect the strong IP12 cycle to benefit the June Q. We have seen this trend before with AAPL, and believe
the next two cycles may prove challenging with units potentially down Y/Y in FY22 and FY23. China has been a little different than the global pattern
where one strong year is followed by two weak years (see our latest note Smartphone: Q1 Review and Raising 2021 Unit Growth Rate, 5/5/2021). In
China, iPhone units have never rebounded from the iPhone 6/6 Plus highs, and in 2020 were 50% below the peak level of 2015. We do not make
changes to our estimates for AAPL, and maintain our Equal Weight rating.

Mentioned Stocks (Ticker, Date, Price)
Apple, Inc. (AAPL, 15-Jun-2021, USD 129.64), Equal Weight/Neutral, A/CD/CE/D/J/K/L/M/N
Other Material Conflicts: One of the Research Analysts on the fundamental equity coverage team (and/or a member of his or her household) has a
long position in Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VGT) which primary holding is in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL).
Valuation Methodology: We rate AAPL Equal Weight with a price target of $134. While many are excited about Services and Wearables, we
remain cautious on high Street expectations for the 5G iPhone cycle. We believe EPS growth will come mostly from buybacks. Our $134 PT is based
on a 25x P/E multiple on our CY22e EPS estimate of $5.37.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: 1) iPhone growth. Apple market share
peaked several years ago, and the company has not had a hit phone in a few years.5G iPhones could help AAPL regain share after Huawei
sanctions, but the hefty valuation already prices in a very successful iPhone 5G cycle, leading to more downside than upside risks.
2) Installed base impact on Services. Services have been a great growth business, but if the installed base grows more slowly or starts to shrink the
segment could be materially affected.
3) Valuation. AAPL is trading at all time high multiples despite little operating income growth, falling gross and operating margins, and share losses
in the core business.
4) Regulation. We expect to see increasing regulatory scrutiny on AAPL's practices in its App Store. Increasing regulation could lead to a change in
its business model, or lower cut from app developers.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (“the industry coverage
universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.

Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.

Barclays | The Coca-Cola Company
Yesterday, KO reported 2Q20 Comparable EPS of $0.42, which compares to Consensus
$0.40 and Barclays Research $0.37. Below-the-line items were a 1c drag to earnings.
What to do with the stock. To be sure, there is still significant uncertainty ahead with
regard to the course of the COVID-19 outbreak and extent/timeline of its impact on away-
from-home consumption. That said, with headwinds likely to prove temporary over time
and much of the market arguably already trading on “post-COVID” CY21 earnings power,
we find it difficult to reconcile KO’s underperformance versus its peer set (down -15% YTD
vs. XLP -2.5%).
A Different Time and P(l)ace
As expected, global unit case volume for KO improved markedly over the course of 2Q
(down mid-single digits in July MTD vs. -10% in June and -25% in April). That said, with the
COVID-19 crisis yet to find its peak in certain regions and others still in the process of re-
opening their economies and testing new thresholds for social interaction, the trajectory of
the COVID-19 outbreak remains unpredictable. Against this backdrop, KO did well, in our
view, to shift the focus of yesterday’s earnings call away from guess work around how the
next six months could hypothetically play out and to a more holistic conversation around
enhancements to its go-forward strategy intended to help restore the business to pre-
COVID levels over time. Leveraging key learnings through the crisis, CEO James Quincey
outlined a new set of 5 strategic priorities (replacing the ones introduced at CAGNY in
February), three of which we highlight below:
With the next three years presenting a very different reality than what would have been
anticipated just a few months ago, KO is accelerating existing efforts to optimize its
portfolio…It’s been nearly 3 years since Mr. Quincey first discussed the concept of
eliminating “zombies” with the Street – shutting down sub-scale, underperforming
brands/SKUs soaking up critical resources that could be better allocated towards brands
with building momentum. While there has been progress on the SKU front (eg. eliminating
700 SKUs in 2018 and 600 in 2019), with >50% of KO’s 400 current master brands
highlighted as single-country brands that in aggregate contribute a mere 2% to annual
revenues, it would appear that brand work has lagged at best. In this regard, it would seem
KO isn’t going to let the current crisis go to waste and is redoubling efforts to streamline the
portfolio. Recall, KO and other CPGs have tactically narrowed assortment through the peak
of the lockdown periods in order to ease pressure on supply chains and minimize out of
stocks for key SKUs. We’d think the background work enabling these moves similarly
yielded the realization of just how fat the tail had become, with the recent decision to
discontinue Odwalla being case in point.
…whilst introducing greater discipline into innovation and marketing such that the
company can support its growth ambitions more efficiently…To improve the odds of
success for “explorer” and “challenger” brands, KO is raising the bar on its innovation
pipeline, shifting focus to bigger, more targeted bets in new growth avenues (eg. AHA
sparkling which has achieved double-digit value share in the U.S. in its first 18 weeks on the
market). Additionally, while the conversation on marketing in recent months has been more
in the way of near-term tactical cuts or delays in spend to offset volume deleverage, Mr.
Quincey discussed longer-term opportunities to improve marketing effectiveness and
efficiency that we believe could drive more lasting benefits to the P&L. In particular, Mr
Quincey highlighted the importance of scalable initiatives eg. a new “Together Tastes
Better” campaign pairing Coke with meals that will kick off in the U.S. but be rolled out
globally and tailored by market.
…and strengthening RGM and in-market execution capabilities to foster stronger
customer and consumer relationships as traffic recovers. To be sure, price-pack

architecture is the most widely discussed component of KO’s Revenue Growth
Management strategy, with yesterday’s call highlighting refillable offerings in Latin America
to address affordability and expanding package assortment in Japan to cater to bifurcating
demand at the high and low-end of the pricing spectrum. That said, with the crisis breeding
opportunity to collaborate more closely with struggling food-service/restaurant operators
and accelerating e-commerce adoption in the industry, KO also discussed efforts to
capitalize on changing channel dynamics. To this point, we heard several examples of new
partnerships in the on-premise channel to support a recovery in its customer base (eg. a
new “Open Like Never Before” campaign behind re-openings in Europe, a rapid response
resource for food-service outlets in the U.S., touchless FreeStyle machines). Additionally, KO
is also emphasizing investments in digital strategies to drive sales, efficiencies and data
analytics across the business, including partnering with 3PP food aggregators and e-
commerce platforms and accelerating proprietary B2B and DTC platforms. As we reflect on
these developments, we are reminded of the Rubik’s cube analogy first shared at CAGNY in
February and, in particular, the role that data and analytics as well as healthy bottler
relationships are playing in identifying and segmenting new growth opportunities.
Changes to the model. We are taking down our organic sales outlook for 2020 slightly to -
11% (vs. -10% prior), driven by weaker concentrate shipments this quarter, offset by a
more favorable outlook for 3Q given unit case volume exit rates and trends month-to-date
in July. Including a ~300 bps headwind from currency and a +50bps contribution from M&A,
we model net sales down ~15%. We look for gross margins to be down -120 bps reflecting
volume deleverage in the P&L and currency pressure, offset by mix benefits from lower
margin businesses growing more slowly than the balance of the portfolio eg. BIG, Costa. We
look for SG&A to be up +70 bps including a -35% cut to currency-neutral marketing spend
vs. our original estimates at the start of the year and a -15% cut to currency-neutral non-
marketing opex leaving our operating margins up +30 bps for the year. Including higher
interest expense from new debt issuances this quarter, we are taking down our estimates
for full-year EPS by 7c to $1.79.
For 3Q specifically, we model organic sales down -9% and net sales down -12% including a
~300 bps headwind from currency and a +70 bps tailwind from M&A. We assume a
sequential improvement in trend versus 2Q across all segments with the biggest
incremental change coming in EMEA and Global Ventures given mid-late 2Q re-openings in
Europe (which would also benefit Costa) and the likelihood of some volatility in the U.S.
given case resurgence in certain states in the country. We look for gross margins to be
down -200 bps and SG&A to be down -220 bps including a -40% cut to currency-neutral
marketing spend vs. our original estimates at the start of the year and a -20% cut to
currency-neutral non-marketing opex leaving our operating margins up +20 bps.

In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or
Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors
should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

n The increase in our FY21 is largely due to the 3Q beat.
n The decrease in our FY22 isn't material... but reflects a few moving pieces
including weaker card fees, slightly higher expenses, the impact of a $2b
preferred issuance in 3Q and net II benefit from deployment of some cash
into securities (period-end securities were $30b higher than the 3Q
average).
Potential to deploy $200b of excess liquidity into securities
over time
Recall that JPM has deployed less cash into securities than some banks, preferring
to wait for higher rates. Period-end securities rose by $24b this qtr and mgmt
signaled additional purchases were possible. However, a material increase in the
securities book still seems unlikely with rates at current levels as JPM views the long
term return as being too low.
That said, JPM has a ton of dry powder to add securities over time if rates rise and/or
they change their view on rates. On today's call, we asked how much this could be
if rates rise to a level that mgmt felt comfortable would generate a good long term
return. JPM noted it could ""easily"" deploy $200b of cash into securities. Note that
upside from potentially deploying this $200b is in addition to the rate leverage JPM
discloses in the 10Q.
n This $200b compares to nearly $600b of excess deposit growth since 4Q19
(ie before COVID and related central bank actions).
n We define excess deposit growth as the change in deposits (of
$840b vs. a combined $244b increase in loans + securities). Recall
that mgmt has previously acknowledged that some of the deposit
growth over this period is noncore/less sticky as system liquidity is
reduced over time/rates rise.
$200b of liquidity deployment can add nearly 20% to EPS with rates at 3%

JPMorgan Chase
It all depends on the level of rates and whether JPM would deploy the full $200b.
But assuming they would, we can run some earnings sensitivities shown below.
n If 10 year Treasuries hit 2% and JPM were to deploy the full $200b into 30
year agency backed RMBS pass throughs (what big banks typically buy),
this would boost net income by 11%.
n Each 100bp rise in base rates would increase this 5%...so the $200b could
be worth 16% if 10 year rates hit 3%, RMBS spreads remain around current
levels (of 50bps) and JPM deploys the full $200b. These are a lot of ifs, but
this helps illustrate the potential earnings upside from deploying excess
liquidity.
n As noted in the prior section, the earnings leverage outlined just
above from deploying excess liquidity is in addition to the rate
leverage disclosed in JPM's 10Q. Recall that as of 6/30, a 100bp rise
in rates would boost JPM's (2022) net income by 15%.
Other tidbits from the call
n Mgmt noted expenses would increase in 2022 vs. 2021, even though
capital markets related revenue (and related comp) would likely be lower.
This is higher than the flattish costs assumed in consensus for 2022 prior to
today, but also not a huge surprise given expense pressure at JPM and
across the banking industry. On the call, JPM noted the likely higher costs
in 2022 reflected continued inflationary pressures and investment spend.
We previously assumed flat costs and now assume a 1-2% rise.
n Mgmt acknowledged that FY22 net II guidance implied a $300m-plus
increase in 4Q21 vs. 3Q. However, JPM cautioned not to run rate the implied
$13.5b given seasonal boosts from markets/trading and one time benefits
from PPP. Looking out to 1Q, there's also day count adjustments to make.
This caused some market concern that consensus FY22 net II expectations
(of $55.1b) may be too high.
n However, we'd point out that mgmt was also upbeat about card
growth in 2022 and as discussed above has already started to
deploy some liquidity into securities.
n Accounting for all this, our 1Q22 net II estimate is $13.1b and our
FY22 estimate is $55.8b.
n Card fees: In the Consumer Bank, card fees were $651m in 3Q vs. $1.2b in
2Q. Mgmt noted on the call that the sequential decline was primarily due to
higher marketing/acquisition costs and due to a $180m adjustment to
rewards liabilities. The adjustment is considered a one time event while
marketing costs are expected to continue and be slightly higher in 4Q.
n On loan growth, mgmt noted it has seen some recovery across lending
products including the following:
n For card, mgmt noted faster spend down of excess deposits for
customers who are generally inclined to revolve and believe card
outstandings should grow in 2022.
n In home lending, mgmt expects portfolio additions to outpace
prepayments in 4Q (similar to 3Q trends).
n For C&I, mgmt noted that utilization rates had a little bit of an uptick
among smaller corporates.
n In CRE, mgmt noted robust origination pipelines and have removed
any pandemic-related pullbacks in credit and expect to see a little
bit of net loan growth going forward.
n Mgmt also noted expected loan growth in markets but noted it's

n FICC trading: In the earnings materials, it was noted that the current qtr
included an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio.

Quick recap of 3Q results below and see full note from earlier today
What Mattered Most in 3Q21 Results
EPS of $3.74 vs. consensus of $2.96. It was a strong quarter overall. The biggest
drivers of the EPS beat were a large loan loss reserve release (and lower than
expected charge-offs) and a tax credit. However, even ex these items, results were
better than expected--with net interest income, fees and costs all better.
n Net interest income upside was driven by slightly better loans with 4Q to
benefit from modest deployment of cash into securities later in the qtr.
n Outside of net II, EQ trading, IB fees, and asset mgmt revenues were all
better than DBe.

given still-recovering volumes from COVID-impacted 2021 (1H21 volumes
remained below 2019 levels) and continuation of stronger-than-historical
price/mix given pricing/RGM focus to offset cost pressures. All-in, we are
currently modeling +7.0% organic revenue growth with unit case volumes
+3.0% and price/mix +4.0%, although we think there could be further upside
tension with further normalization of the operating environment.

 Margin Expectations for 2022. Despite its more asset-lite model, KO still faces
impacts from the inflationary cost/supply chain environment and FX, and with its 3Q
earnings guided to a mid-single-digits headwind to COGS for 2022 (i.e., higher than
mid-single digits inflation for commodities) as the company rolls into higher cost
hedges in 2022. We think it’s possible that the cost environment has gotten
incrementally more challenging for at least some of KO’s cost exposures, particularly
for juice, which is The Coca-Cola Company’s largest direct commodity exposure
(orange juice concentrate prices have surged ~30% since KO’s 3Q21 earnings call).
Price increases and accelerating RGM initiatives should help to offset some of the
inflationary impacts, although we see other headwinds including acquisition of
BODYARMOR and faster growth of finished goods (carries lower gross margin).
From a G&A perspective, we expect the company to be able to drive some leverage
overall as the company further optimizes marketing spending. Net-net, we are
modeling for gross margin compression of -39 bps in 2022 and operating margin
contraction of -6 bps.
 Updated FX Outlook. During the company’s 3Q21 earnings call on October 27, 2021,
management reiterates its full-year 2021 currency outlook including a +1-2% benefit to
the top-line and +2-3% benefit to EPS and introduced expectations for 4Q21 including
flat impact from FX on the top-line and a +2% tailwind to EPS. The company also
provided an initial 2022 currency outlook of a -2% to -3% headwind to both the top-
line and EPS. Since the 3Q21 earnings call, the USD has further strengthened
according to our currency model by an average of about -80 bps between 4Q21-3Q22.
For 4Q21, given hedging in place for G10 currencies we think it’s likely that KO could
remain close to its approximately even impact guidance on the top-line, and while we
would assume that the currency impact implied by our model would fall within KO’s
initial 2022 guidance at this point to the top-line, we do think it could be toward the
lower-end, and could be below the low-end on EPS given historical multiplier of 1.2-
1.5x currency impact from top-line to bottom-line. For the quarter, we forecasting a -
0.5% impact to the top-line (in-line with consensus) and for 2022 we are forecasting an
FX headwind of -2.7% (vs. consensus -2.2%).
 4Q21 Expectations. We are expecting another quarter of double-digits organic
revenue growth (on unit case basis) as we expect a modest acceleration in the two-year
volume and price/mix CAGR given further recovery in away-from-home performance
through the quarter vs. 3Q and also higher price/mix given additional pricing actions
and further progress on RGM initiatives. We are forecasting 4Q21 organic revenue
growth of +12.8% (unit case volume +6.2%, price/mix +6.6%) versus the apples-to-
apples Consensus Metrix forecast of +13.0% (unit case volumes +6.4% and price/mix
+6.6%). Using concentrate shipments consensus is currently modeling for +3.9%
organic growth (shipments -2.7%, price/mix +6.6%) and on an apples-to-apples basis
our model also calls for organic growth of +3.9% (shipments -2.6%, price/mix +6.6%).
On gross margins, we are below the Street as we see tailwinds from pricing and away-
from-home recovery being offset by the fewer shipping days in 4Q (six fewer), which
drives deleverage, and headwind to gross margins from full acquisition of
BODYAMOR, which closed on November 1 (finished product model typically carries
lower margins). We are forecasting 4Q21 EPS of $0.41, which is in-line with the
current Bloomberg consensus estimate and up a penny from our prior estimate.

Thoughts on 2022 Outlook
KOprovided some broad strokes around its initial outlook for 2022 with its 3Q earnings
on October 27th, most directly around the cost/currency environment (anticipating
MSD% COGS inflation and -2% to -3% top-line/EPS impact from FX) and more
indirectly around the top-line, as we recall below. That said, a lot has obviously changed
since then, and we provide our view on where KO will likely land on its initial 2022
guidance below.
Outlook for Revenue Growth
Management has sounded confident on the underlying top-line momentumgiven recent
organizational changes (“emerging stronger”), investments behind innovation, and
marketing optimization (""doing more with the same"")and CEO Quincey noted at a recent
conference that “we’re confident that we’re going to come out of COVID with a model
that can drive the revenue at the top-end of the model,” which calls for organic revenue of
+4-6%. We (and current consensus per Consensus Metrix) are anticipating another above-
algorithm year in 2022given still-recovering volumes from COVID-impacted 2021
(1H21 volumes remained below 2019 levels) and continuation of stronger-than-historical
price/mix given pricing/RGM focus to offset cost pressures (management commentary
has been supportive with CEO Quincey noting “we will be looking at exactly what
level our pricing needs to be for 2022…and we certainly intend to earn the right
to take the pricing for the brands and the packaging and beyond”) and benefit
from further recovery runway for the higher price per ounce away-from-home channel
(we believe that KO has likely regained ~70% of lost away-from-home volumes thus far).
From a guidance perspective, KO may take an initially conservative approach and
not stray from its +4-6% algorithm (but point to the higher-end), although we see
clear upside past the high-end and believe KO would prefer to raise through the
year as visibility increases following some potential early year disruption from the
Omicron wave.
All-in,we are currently modeling +7.0% organic revenue growth with unit case
volumes +3.0% and price/mix +4.0% vs. current Consensus Metrix of +7.2%
(shipment volumes +3.0% and price/mix +4.7%). There could be upside tension to our
numbers as our volume estimates contemplate a continuing gradual acceleration in the
CAGR with stronger 2H vs. 1H (though on year/year basis we model for a stronger 1H
given the compares) but supposes2022 volumes land about 3.4% above 2019 levels or a
3-year CAGR of about 1.1% (pre-COVID 2018/2019 2-year unit case volume CAGR was
+2.1% since CEO Quinceytook over)and our price/mix estimates imply a 3-year CAGR
of +2.4% (pre-COVID 2018/2019 2-year price/mix CAGR +3.3%), which seems
somewhat conservative given the pricing/RGM actions likely higher and more
widespread than historical,likely continued lower promotional environment given
inflation and supply chain pressures, and FX pressures.Looking beyond organic growth,
on FX, as we detail below, KO provided initial guidance for currency to be a -2% to -3%
headwind to the top-line based on spot rates in late October and hedged positions and
since then the USD has appreciated further, so currency headwinds could be toward the
lower-end of the range, and on M&A we are estimating that the acquisition of
BODYARMOR will add about 2.5% to the top-line.In the table below, we outline our
2021 forecasts vs. consensus.

Outlook for Margins
Despite its more asset-lite model, KO still faces impacts from the inflationary
cost/supply chain environment (commodities, labor, transportation), and FX, and
with its 3Q earnings guided to a mid-single-digits headwind to COGS for 2022 (i.e.,
higher than mid-single digits inflationfor commodities, which is a portion of overall
COGS) as the company rolls into higher cost hedges in 2022 following favorable
hedges in 2021. We think it’s possible that the cost environment has gotten
incrementally more challenging for at least some of KO’s cost exposures, particularly
for juice, which is The Coca-Cola Company’s largest direct commodity exposure as
orange juice concentrate prices have surged nearly 30% since KO’s 3Q21 earnings
call. As mentioned above, KO has put through off-cycle price increases and is
accelerating RGM initiatives to help to offset some of the inflationary impacts and
incidence based pricing model means that as bottlers take pricing to offset more
direct impacts KO benefits from the flow through. Another headwind will be the
incorporation of BODYARMOR which carry lower GM, and to a lesser extent the
faster growth of finished goods (especially Costa growing faster with the reopening).
On BODYARMOR, we estimate that overall the brand could have a 40-50 bps
annualized unfavorable impact on KO’s gross margins given that it is a lower margin
finished goods model that is outsourced to third-party co-manufacturers. From a
G&A perspective, we expect the company to be able to drive some leverage overall
as the company further optimizes marketing spending, which should result in
leverage on other operating expenses as some spending gets moved to consumer-


Andrea Teixeira, CFA North America Equity Research
(1-212) 622-6735 04 February 2022

facing advertising expense. Net-net, we are modeling for gross margin compression
of -39 bps in 2022 and operating margin contraction of -6 bps.
On the earnings front, we are raising our 2022 EPS forecast by a penny to $2.46 (up
+7.6% YOY, in-line with KO’s long-term algorithm, although not much leverage
from the top-line) compared to the Bloomberg consensus of $2.43. As noted above,
the company guided to a -2% to -3% headwind to EPS from unfavorable FX and
since the company last reported earnings the USD has appreciated further, which
given the historical 1.2-1.5x multiplier from top-to bottom-line could point to an
impact more onerous than the low-end of the guidance. That said, we think KO will
pull the necessary levers (e.g., pricing, RGM) to drive HSD% EPS growth in 2022.

The Coca-Cola Company (KO, Neutral-rated) is scheduled to report 4Q21 earnings

$0.41, which is in-line with the current Bloomberg consensus estimate and up a
penny from our prior estimateafter adjustinga number of our underlying
assumptions (lowered sales slightly due to FX, adjusted gross margins as we were
likely being too punitive in the quarter given pricing flow-through, and adjusted
SG&A higher closer to 2019 levels).Our top-line estimates are slightly ahead of
current consensus, which we believe is partially attributable to higher estimate for
M&A contribution, although on organic growth (concentrate shipment basis) we are
largely in-line. On gross margins, we are below the Street as we see tailwinds from
pricing and away-from-homerecovery being offset by the fewer shipping days in 4Q
(six fewer), which drives deleverage, and headwind to gross margins from full
acquisition of BODYAMOR, which closed on November 1(finished product model
carries lower margins).

Organic Revenue Growth
KO is lapping a -6% organic revenue decline in the year-ago period (on unit case volume
basis, on concentrate volume basis a more modest -3% decline), the same as in 3Q20, and
like 3Q21 we are expecting another quarter of double-digits organic revenue growth (on
unit case basis) as we expect a modest acceleration in the two-year volume and price/mix
CAGR as we broadly expect further recovery in away-from-home performance through
the quarter vs. 3Q (3Q was impacted by Delta variant) and also higher price/mix given
additional pricing actions and further progress on RGM initiatives. While Omicron began
surging late in 4Q, we think the impact was likely relatively limited in the quarter,
although looking ahead to 1Q22 impacts tothe supply chain could have been more
material (e.g., sick employees, softer on-premise).
3Q21 volumes landed ahead of 2019 levels despite a softer August period impacted by
Delta variantas well ongoing lockdowns/state of emergency in several markets inAsia
Pacificmarkets (e.g., China, Japan), and poor weather in Europe. However trends
improved sequentially in September and momentum heading into 4Q sounded solid with
management describing October results started “strong and in-line with expectations” so
we feel comfortable modeling for some modest improvement in the two-year CAGR.
From an organic growth perspective, the calendar 4Q has six fewer shipping days relative
to the prior year (which had two extra days), which will impact the concentrate shipment
volumes and result in a convergence of concentrate shipments to unit case volumes (year-
to-3Q21 concentrate shipments +13% vs. unit case volume +8%), which had been
running ahead due to five extra calendar days in 1Q21 and inventory build by bottlers to
mitigate anticipates supply chain pressures.
From a price/mix perspective, underlying our expectations for a slight acceleration in the
two-year trend is further pricing actions, which should be felt more fully in 4Q (e.g., off-
cycle price increase of HSD% in US put through in August), as well as further benefits
from RGM initiatives to offset supply chain inflationary pressures (incidence pricing
from bottlers that are feeling pressures more). Sequentially there should be acceleration in
price/mix as well as reopening has positive price/mix implications given higher price per
ounce given immediate consumption as well as higher finished good sales (recall, during
4Q20 there were incremental restrictions in the US as well as other International
markets).
Weare forecasting 4Q21 organic revenue growth of +12.8% (unit case volume +6.2%,
price/mix +6.6%) versus the apples-to-apples Consensus Metrix forecast of +13.0% (unit
case volumes +6.4% and price/mix +6.6%). Consensus and the company utilize
concentrate shipments to derive organic growth and on that basis the consensus is
currently modeling for +3.9% organic growth (shipments -2.7%, price/mix +6.6%) and
on an apples-to-apples basis our model also calls for organic growth of +3.9% (shipments
-2.6%, price/mix+6.6%).On a regional basis, our organic sales forecasts are as follows:
+14.0% in EMEA (unit case volume +7.0%, price/mix +7.0%), +26.0% in Latin America
(unit case volume +6.0%, price/mix +20.0%), +11.5% in North America (unit case
volume +6.0%, price/mix +5.5%), +2.5% in Asia Pacific (unit case volume +4.0%,
price/mix -1.5%), +34.0% in Global Ventures (unit case volume +14.0%, price/mix
+20.0%), and +2.0% in BIG (unit case volume +2.0%, price/mix flat).

Underlying US Trends Healthy +LDD% in 4Q21Driven by Pricing, Accelerates
Sequentially on Both One-Year and Two-Year; Expect Continued Recovery in
Untracked Channels, Albeit Likely Decelerating
Within the tracked channels during the periods corresponding to 4Q21 (i.e., weeks
ending 10/9/21 through 1/1/22), overall dollar takeaway trends acceleratedstrongly
sequentially from 3Q21 driven by improvement in both unit volume and price/unit,
in addition to modestly easier comparisons.Specifically, dollar takeaway in the 13-
weeks ended 1/1/22 for KO was up +12.3% YOY(units -0.1%, price/unit +12.4%)
vs. +7.6% (units -3.1%, price/unit +10.7%) in the periods corresponding to 3Q21
with year-ago comparisons easing sequentially by 160 bps (lapping +9.3% dollar
growth last year 4Q20 vs. +10.9% in 3Q20) and as such the two-year trend for 4Q21
accelerated an impressive +320 bps sequentiallyto +21.6%. In CSDs, the
improvement in growth rates in the 13-weeks ended 1/1/22 was somewhat stronger
with dollar takeaway up +13.4% vs. +7.2% in the 13-week period ending 10/2/21
(+620 bps sequential accelerationvs. overall +470 bps sequential acceleration),
partially helped by an easier comparison (year-ago comparisons eased by 370 bps),
resulting in a +250 bps sequential acceleration in the two-year stack trend to +22.1%.
The improvement in CSD trends is being primarily driven by an acceleration in
price/mix to +14.2% in the 13-weeks ended 1/1/22 from +9.5% in the 13-weeks
ended 10/2/21 as the company feels the full impact of additional pricing in the US
put through in August, although volume performance also improved (-0.7% in 13-
weeks ended 1/1/22, a +140 bps sequential improvement) given easier comparisons.
It's also possible that the company saw some channel shift back to the off-premise
with the surge in Omicron variant at the end of the year, though overall the company

should benefit from recovery in away from home volumes given prior year impact
from some states restricting bar/indoor dining during 4Q20.

Updated FX Outlook
During the company’s 3Q21 earnings call on October 27, 2021, management reiterates its
full-year 2021 currency outlook including a +1-2% benefit to the top-line and +2-3%
benefit to EPS and introduced expectations for 4Q21 including flat impact from FX on
the top-line and a +2% tailwind to EPS.The company also provided an initial 2022
currency outlook of a -2% to -3% headwind to both the top-line and EPS. Since the 3Q21
earnings call, the USD has further strengthened according to our currency model by an
average of about -80 bps between 4Q21-3Q22. For 4Q21, given hedging in place for G10
currencies we think it’s likely that KO could remain close to its approximately even
impact guidance on the top-line, and while we would assume that the currency impact
implied by our model would fall within KO’s initial 2022 guidance at this pointto the
top-line, we do think it could be toward the lower-end, and could be below the low-end
on EPS given historical multiplier of 1.2-1.5x currency impact from top-line to bottom-
line. For the quarter, we are now forecasting a -0.5% impact to the top-line (vs. prior flat),
in-line with the current Consensus Metrix consensus of -0.5%. Looking ahead to 2022,
we are forecasting an FX headwind of -2.7%, which is unchanged from our last published
update on December 13, 2021, and is 50 bps below the current Consensus Metrix
consensus of -2.2%. Since our last update FX impact has been relatively unchanged
overall.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
The Coca-Cola Company(Overweight; Price Target: $64.00)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on KO shares. We think Coca-Cola will benefit from
economies re-opening and is well positioned to reaccelerate organic growth above
thetop-end of its long-term 4-6% range. KO has undergone a deep positive
transformation over the past few years by improving its sales portfolio, refranchising
and consolidating bottling assets globally, setting up new systems and procurement
in the US, shifting focus from volume to value growth, and transitioning senior
management, all of which give us confidence the underlying fundamentals of the
business. While the multi-billion dollar dispute with the IRS is an overhang, we think
it is already reflected in the share price.
Valuation
Our Dec 2022 price target of $64 is based on 24x P/E (2-year historical average
multiple) applied to our 2023 estimates, and roughly one turn discount to closest peer
PEP. Our $64 price target implies ~4% upside in the next 11 months plus a ~3%
dividend yield.While the IRS tax dispute and FX headwinds are overhangs, we think
these are more than reflected in current valuation, creating favorable risk/reward.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
Downside risks to our Overweight rating and price target include: (1)negative
resolution in the tax dispute with the IRS (not contemplated in our model); (2) the
uncertainty around when or if the pandemic is contained and its impact on out-of-
home consumption; (3) further margin de-leverage because of inflationary headwinds
and/or volume losses; and (4) increasing unfavorable FX movements—all of which
could drive further negative earnings revisions.

Summary - From Digital Banking 1.0 to Digital Banking 2.0
JPM seems excited about its pursuit to become the first dominant 2.0 Digital Bank. Yet, this also
carries risks. The picture below sums up our thoughts—diving off a cliff into the water reflects that
there is no turning back from a generational change in core banking systems. This is necessitated by
the goal to provide Big Tech-type, front-end customer experiences and services.
Digital Banking 1.0 has been good for JPM. For most of the last decade, JPM's ability to change its
banking services from analog to digital—or relatively more to bots from bankers—has aided JPM's
improvement in both market share and efficiency. Tech at JPM has worked well—over the past seven
years, JPM has shown strong, tech-enabled positive operating leverage, and relative stock price
outperformance vs. the SPX and BKX (up 2.8x vs. 2.3x and 2.0x).
Digital Banking 2.0 is now. JPM's new phase of its corporate life cycle is that it seeks to build a better
mousetrap by providing new functionality in digital form that was previously unavailable, whereby
the experience transcends traditional banking functions. The impetus is both the ability to do so
—new tech—and the necessity given the myriad of new competitors. We describe the difference
between Digital Banking 1.0 and 2.0 as evolving from mere adoption, transactions, and replication to
engagement, relationships, and innovation.

Software analyst gives framework for analysis. Our firm's software analyst gives a framework in his
previously published work—moats, automation, and data (“MAD about software”)—for discussing
software firms which can apply to JPM, as follows:
1. Moats. JPM has made it clear that it can spend whatever it takes, and believes it has the scale
as the No.1 bank to do so. JPM's tech spending in 2022 alone equals the total expenses of the
eighth largest bank and ranks among the top few of all industries. JPM's goal and potential is to
provide superior, homegrown differentiated products, platforms, and experiences, with seamless
multichannel delivery, transitioning from “share of wallet” to “share of life” experiences. One clear
example of expansion far beyond traditional banking is its acquisition of restaurant guide Zagat.
2. Automation. To meet JPM's customer targets, another key goal is to modernize its infrastructure
and further its scalability with more bots relative to bankers. Indeed, half of JPM’s infrastructure
spend is on the Cloud, and JPM targets $1.5B in automation and other productivity savings.
3. Data. JPM also seeks to unlock the power of its data, which includes 500 petabytes of data
(for context, the Library of Congress has under 25 petabytes of data). JPM expects that its few
hundred use cases with AI should lead to $1B of benefits, and it expects to soon have a few
thousand use cases. An overriding objective is for cybersecurity everywhere and all the time.
Risks with the new transformation: The key question is whether the pace of accelerating, record tech
investments is faster than its ability to effectively manage, similar to the past. Several risks abound as
follows:
• Management risk: A key question is whether JPM is pursuing too much at the same time. It is
pursuing the expansion of 14 tech-related deals and strategic investments over the past two
years, launching a consumer bank outside the US for the first time (the UK and Brazil are only a
start), transitioning the core banking system to the Cloud, and even acting as a first mover to the
Metaverse.
○ The decision of if and when to cut losses (as it did with FINN) or invest more (as with US
consumer digital banking) can be a tough one. Indeed, in the opening remarks at JPM’s May
2022 investor day, CEO Jamie Dimon said that tech success can be “hard to measure at
times”—which means it is even harder for those of us on the outside to have visibility toward
progress.

○ The strategic question is whether this is an effective grand plan that pieces together historical
investment and other spending, with dozens of transactions to reinforce leadership for the
next decade or, as relayed to us by investors, whether this is a new type of empire building built
on top of past success but only to push too much.
• Operating risk: First, the transition to new systems and esp. the Cloud (half of JPM’s infrastructure
spending) has typically come with more costs, complexity and time than initially thought. Second,
acquisitions have their own items, especially expansion of digital banking in the crowded UK
market. Third, the level of “technical debt” is greater than previously realized.
○ To get to Digital Banking 2.0, JPM needs to have a more modernized back office and reduce
it's higher than previously known level of apps (6400) and data centers (37), which it intends
and needs to do. These are necessary steps to achieve more real-time processing with greater
amounts of data to better service customers. Indeed, JPM mentioned “technical debt” on its
4Q21 earnings call for the first time ever.
○ The adage “better late than never” applies since JPM has known about the strategic threat
—its 2014 annual report proclaimed that “Silicon Valley is Coming”—and is now taking more
forceful actions, given Big Tech knocking at the door and sometimes getting in.
• Financial risk: What’s new is the degree that JPM is willing to sacrifice returns in order to gain
share, given the highest increase in tech spending and total expenses in the company’s history.
JPM’s record $14B of tech spending raises the question whether any bank can spend this amount
of money wisely, esp. given a discretionary portion ($7B) that is more than 2x above the $2-3B
level from 2008-2017.
○ This leads to certain, front-loading of expenses for less certain back end benefits. We forecast
the worst three years of operating leverage in the firms modern history (2021-2023). Indeed,
inflation has already increased the amount of discretionary investments post 2Q22 results.
○ Much depends on the effectiveness of overseers to ensure financial discipline, though there
have been changes in the role of CFO for the firm and in three of the four business lines. In
addition, the high level of tech spending is part necessity given JPM's level of “technical debt”
and complexity that comes with its expansive business and geographic mix.
• Cloud risk: Having rejected the pursuit of the Cloud a few years ago, we suspect that JPM may
be only middle of the pack in its pursuit to embrace the Cloud despite its more aggressive stance
today. In some ways, JPM looks like others, since all large US banks have a hybrid, multiple Cloud
approach (JPM uses AWS, Google, and Microsoft), with seemingly more activities on the front-end
than the back-end.
○ We suspect that JPM is in the industry-trend ballpark for doubling Cloud workloads to 15%
YoY. This is based on a survey by Accenture of 150 global banks. Yet, unlike some others, JPM
seems unable to shoot for “zero ops” (no data systems) given its status as a systemically
critical firm.
○ Embracing core banking conversion. Only 7% of banks have converted their core banking
platform to the cloud (Accenture). This makes JPM's decision to do so an industry-shaking one,
implying the transition of decades old code off clunky mainframes to a new platform.

Opportunities - Summary of JPM's Tech Effort using our A-G format
• AI: $1B of expected impact with use cases that should expand from hundreds to thousands; yet,
third-party vendors can be like arms dealers which sell to JPM as well as its competitors
• Big data: 500 petabytes of data; however, it can take years to fully optimize, clean, and use
cohesively
• Cloud: moving core banking system among other areas and comprises half of infrastructure
investments; on the other hand, the track record is that it costs more, takes longer, and is more
complex than expected
• Digital banking: 61 mil. active digital customers and top 1 or 2 in almost all digital banking
categories; neobanks have est. 1 in 4 global consumer customers and lower cost of entry vs. the
past
• Electronic payments: $10T of payments processed per day
• Faster processing: doubled compute/storage volumes with only modest growth in infrastructure
costs (2% CAGR 2015-2021); yet, technical debt is reflected by 6400 apps and 33 data centers.
• Governance: Past success—JPM had used tech to improve share and efficiency over most of last
decade; a new risk is the greater willingness to accept negative operating leverage for market share
Risks - Summary of JPM's Tech Effort Using the A-G Format
Below we summarize the risks to JPMorgan tech efforts in our A-G format:
• AI: Greater use of third-party vendors can be like dealing with arms dealers, which sell to JPM
as well as its competitors. In other words, JPM's innovation-leading approach to tech might
get diluted. Moreover, another risk is the shorter life cycle of tech, meaning the need for new
investments— i.e., that is one advantage of being a “close follower.” Lastly, the CIO said evidence of
success is to track the firm’s business results.
• Big data: Scrubbing data into a more useable format may take years to execute, esp. for a firm with
500 petabytes of data and legacy infrastructrure. Over 5 years, tech investment spend has about
doubled ($3B in 2017 to $7B in est. 2022) and increased from 1/3 to 1/2 of the tech budget. This

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Equity Research
pace of increase can lead to wasteful spending. Indeed, sometimes tech is the wrong tool for the
job—the industry applies tech solutions for a process that is flawed est. 1/5th of the time.
• Cloud: JPM's core banking system conversion comprises half of infrastructure investments, and
the track record is that it costs more, takes longer, and is more complex than expected (based on
observations at other firms taking a similar approach). Despite the somewhat late start toward
the cloud in general, JPM's hybrid approach is on the path toward public cloud optimization. Yet,
moving 100% of its consumer core platform to Thought Machine (incl. 50% of its data to the public
cloud by year-end 2023) comes with operational and reputational risks.
• Digital banking: Even though 61 mil. active digital customers (the largest) and top 1 or 2 in almost
all digital banking categories, neobanks have est. 1 in 4 global consumer customers and lower cost
of entry vs. the past.
• Electronic payments: JPM is still in the early innings (in our view) of aligning this higher P/E, lower
capital-intensive activities across its LOBs.
• Faster processing: Doubled compute/storage volumes with only modest growth in infrastructure
costs (2% CAGR 2015-2021), yet it still has significant technical debt as reflected by 6400 apps
and 33 data centers. For example, State Street is a cautionary tale; its tech transformation this
decade led to a worse pre-tax margin due to complexity, cost, difficulty, and time (per its board’s
lead director). Many JPM efforts probably have no payback, though some have an ROI of 2x,
and recent investor day presentations noted five or so year payback periods (consumer, non-US
consumer).
• Governance: First, digitization creates new risks, and JPM’s cyber spend seems defensive to
protect against what might be the No.1 risk to banking. While JPM and other large banks seem
to have greater resilience, they are more exposed given a larger attack surface. Second, JPM had
used tech to improve share and efficiency over most of last decade, but the new risk is the greater
willingness to accept negative operating leverage for market share. There are 4 CIOs for JPM’s 4
business lines, and then there is also the firm’s CIO who oversees tech for the entire firm. While
there are synergies by business line, the ability to coordinate activities across business lines does
not seem easy.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks

Investment Thesis
 This issue is certain to us: front-loaded spending in the near term
for less certain back-ended benefits. JPM continues to reflect our “Goliath is Winning” theme, but the cost and time frame for doing so are
greater and longer than expected. Moreover, JPM is more expensive than the average bank at a time when other banks are more pure plays
on our 2022 theme (“NII to the Sky”).

Focus On Tone: The commentary from management is likely the most important thing that
could play out on this coming call, and if we were to get continuation of “the sun rising” or
related optimism, along with solid 1Q22 results, like last quarter we think shares can trade
up. A lot of retail headwinds should abate as we move through the quarters in 2022, both on
the revenue acceleration and the margin headwinds easing. We expect this AMZN-specific
positive to offset the macro pressure that many in low gross margin e-commerce are likely to
see in 2022.
AWS Step Down: The 4-5 point tougher comps each of the next two quarters may create
some noise around AWS growth rates, but we think fundamentals remain robust, evidenced
by the healthy backlog and strong overall cloud market trends. The $1B in server D+A should
help boost segment margins similar to 2020. We do worry that the system wide increase in
quit-rate (and related cost increase) among tech companies may offset some of the AWS and
Retail margin improvements.

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or Underweight (see definitions below)
relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are deemed to be in the same industry (the ""industry coverage
universe"").
In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as Positive, Neutral or Negative
(see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully
read the entire research report including the definitions of all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-
month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage universe over a 12-month
investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to
comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is
acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Valuation Methodology: We value shares of AMZN using a sum-of-the-parts methodology for its retail and AWS businesses. Our valuation of
AMZN's retail business is based on an average of 30x EBITDA and 3x revenue using our FY22/23 estimates; while we value AWS using 8x our
FY22/23 revenue estimates. Our resulting price target is $4,400.

Barclays | Amazon.com, Inc.
Risks which May Impede the Achievement of the Barclays Research Valuation and Price Target: Downside risks in the short term that could
negatively impact our model and consensus estimates include: 1) greater-than-expected investment levels in retail, and hence lower than expected
CSOI margins, over a more drawn-out period; 2) AWS missing consensus estimates from increased competition or simply because the Street over-
estimated the pace at which on-premise workloads shift to the cloud. We'd put a 40% probability on either of these two risks playing out in 2017
(recall that both played out in 4Q16 and it didn't seem to matter for shares, which are up almost 4.5% from the day after the print (vs S&P up
2%)).
Longer-term risks include the highly competitive ecommerce landscape, increasing shipping costs from same and next-day delivery, which could
be a drag on margins, security breaches or frequent downtime in the AWS business which could slow down public cloud adoption, or execution
missteps that could slow growth of the retail business.

Walmart
The Line in the Sand
Rated: Buy
WMT, $72.45, NYSE
Investment Opinion: Doug McMillon is rebuilding Walmart’s foundation and positioning it for long-
term success. As more of the Street realizes that, WMT shares will have the potential to regain
ground lost from a fall from a high of $90, and then move higher as Walmart regains vitality.
We came away from conversations with members of management at the annual meeting with
a strengthened belief that: 1) US Walmart is being energized; 2) sales will move up soon.
October 1st is the line in the sand, a senior executive told us, when stores must be clean stores, in-
stock and provide fast and friendly service and better assortments. A more favorable shopping
experience correlates with same-store sales gains, he said. If so, sales should improve prior
to October 1st become stronger during the holiday season and convert infrequent shoppers arriving
for holiday shopping to regular shoppers in 2016 and beyond.
A better shopping experience might offer more immediate and sustained benefit than price cutting.
US Walmart seems likely to achieve 2Q/15 same-store sales guidance of 1%. Progress is
occurring even in departments that were once laggards. (See the body of the report.) Grocery
sales appear to be positive. Seasonal weather probably boosted sales of apparel to gains better
than the mid-single digits in 1Q/15, and stirred sales for lawn & garden, grills and outdoor furniture.
Walmart’s e-commerce efforts will be more intense this holiday season than last year—supported
by four new fulfillment centers.
We recommend reading page 4 & 5 for our discussion of groceries and Kroger vs. Walmart.
We believe CEO McMillon expects earnings progress during the second and third years of a
three-year investment period to improve Walmart from one end to another, particularly revitalizing
stores in the US.
Evidence of improvement seems likely to surface sooner than skeptics anticipate.
A reenergized Walmart will likely hasten the burial of zombie retailers with billions of dollars of
general merchandise and grocery sales, from which Walmart should obtain sales boosts.

Risks
The earnings and investment outlook would become bleak if management’s objectives to improve the
business and grow sales consistently are not achieved.
Walmart is exposed to economic, political, legal and operational risks across the globe. Economic
uncertainties and currency risks may cause a shortfall in operating results relative to expectations.
The multitude of risks that face this huge international company can be obtained from the transcript of

investors should allow themselves to be deterred by a rise as steep as this.
The company still has quite a way to go before it exhausts its potential in
the carbonated beverages market and the stock is underpriced relative to
the company's fair value. We also believe the stock will enjoy a further
uptick in price once the exposure of the company's share to the Israeli
market is more meaningful and that because of this it is an interesting
investment at this point in time.
Bottom line
We are initiating of SodaStream with an Outperform rating and a $56.5

Our valuation is based on a multiple of 11x 2017 EV/EBITDAe vs. a
historical average of 11.8x. With the company currently enjoying its most
successful period ever, we think the stock is fairly priced and, assuming
the EV/EBITDA multiples remains around the historical average (11.8x), it
constitutes an attractive risk/reward proposition and therefore deserves to
be an integral component in any portfolio.

Investment thesis
SodaStream has experienced mixed fortunes in recent years, with impressive double – digit
growth lasting from 2007 through 2013, followed by a dramatic downturn in 2014 – 2015. The
strategic decision by management to rebrand and change the company's long – term
business objectives brought about a turnaround that saw it return to growth in 2016 and drove
a corresponding recovery in the stock, which gained 200% over the year.
Early years were challenging…
Up until 2014, the US was SodaStream's primary market. Take up at stores and by
consumers was impressive at the beginning and the resulting growth in sales boded well for
the company's prospects in the global market. But by the end of 2013 the company sensed
that there was a problem in the US market. Stores that had ordered huge quantities of
SodaStream devices found that they couldn't sell them even after cutting prices and putting
on promotions in the form of discounts and coupons. The immediate outcome of these
measures was an erosion in SodaStream's gross margin and an inventory glut that led to a
pullback in sales to the US market.
Figure 1: Sales by geography
At the same time as the build – up in oversupply it became clear that SodaStream's strategy
of branding itself as an alternative to beverage giants such as Coca Cola and Pepsi wasn't
working and that the decision to focus exclusively on the US flavored beverages market was
wrong. This mistake was made all the more evident by the fact that the company had hardly
dedicated any promotions at all to the European market, where consumers are accustomed to
drinking carbonated water (rather than flavored drinks). And if that weren't enough,
SodaStream became embroiled in a political row over the advertisement that appeared at the
Super Bowl featuring the actress Scarlett Johansson, with an accompanying endorsement
from the Israeli prime minister. That endorsement seemed to imply that by locating its main
manufacturing plant in Israel in the Meshor Adumim industrial park in the town of Maaleh
For qualified clients only

Adumim outside Jerusalem, the company was tacitly supporting the incumbent government's
settlement policy beyond the green line. Needless to say, this wasn't exactly the kind of
publicity the business needed.
And then came the change….
Management's solution to the problem was to reallocate marketing spend and move over to
an ROI – based model. SodaStream scaled back its spending on marketing in the US,
focusing instead on the established market in Europe and on new markets such as Japan and
South Korea. Against the backdrop of the growing trend worldwide towards healthier eating it
then changed the message underpinning its marketing, stopped branding itself as an
alternative to bottled soft drinks, and set itself the goal of achieving control of the carbonated
water market.
Lifestyle trends worldwide show that more and more people prefer to drink water rather than
sugary drinks and that many of these new consumers are switching to soda. The growth in
consumption of soda has come mainly at the expense of diet drinks and is supported by
research conducted in the US and in Europe on the damage that can be caused by artificial
sweeteners. In monetary terms, the research (conducted by Euromonitor and a Canadian
institute) reveals that an additional $2.5bn a year is being spent on soda water instead of
sugary/diet drinks.
The change in consumer tastes coupled with SodaStream's strategic turnaround have meant
that the company's sales of soda water to households, in terms of liters, are now the highest
in the sector, with the number of active consumers (i.e. people who drink over 150 liters of
water a year) now estimated to be in excess of 10 million.
Company description
Two core businesses and a business model conducive to continuity
SodaStream manufactures and markets home beverage carbonation systems (soda water
makers) and is the world's top carbonated water brand in terms of sales of water to
households. The company's products enable consumers to easily transform ordinary tap
water into carbonated water and flavored drinks. SodaStream's business model is based on
the lines of the razor and blades business model, meaning that it sells machines for making
soda and earns most of its profit from the sales of complementary items – beverage flavors
and gas refills. SodaStream's products are sold at over 70,000 stores worldwide (in 45
countries), some of which receive their orders from the company directly (or through a local
distributor that the company has acquired), while others are supplied through local retail
chains.
Soda water makers – As of 2016, this business accounted for 34% of total sales and
contributes an estimated 6% to underlying gross margin, according to our estimate.
SodaStream's business model has two principle legs – selling the soda makers at an
affordable price in the region of $58, and using the company's extensive geographic reach to
gain a foothold in consumers' homes. Gross margin on the company's soda makers is
reportedly around 20% and this margin is likely to be pushed up towards 35% with the launch
of the latest generation of machines (under the Sprint brand). The big money here comes
from the sales of complementary products, mainly CO refills.

Disposable products – The reported revenue in this business comes from the sales of
canisters for CO refills and syrups to make flavored beverages. In contrast to the flavorings
2
which are just an additive to the soda water, the refill canisters are integral to the soda
preparation process and thus create reliance on the part of the consumers that have bought a
maker and therefore have an ongoing customer – supplier relationship with SodaStream. A
single canister of CO makes 50 liters of soda, with households using, on average, three
2
canisters a year. In the US gas canisters sell for $15 (stores will occasionally give a discount
on this) while in Europe the price is even lower at around €8. Gross margin on the gas
canisters is very high and is currently over 70%. According to our estimates, the other item in
this category, syrups, accounted for 25% of segment revenue in 2016. Gross margin is high
too at 40%.
Figure 2: Sales by product ($M)
Road to the top looks straightforward but the risks are there
Direct competition
There have been a number of attempts in the past by different brands to get a foothold in the
home carbonated drinks segment. These efforts generally didn't get very far as a result of
either poor technology or a lack of interest on the part of the market in alternative products.
The case that instantly comes to mind here is that of Keurig, the US' largest maker and
distributor of home coffee machines. It spent over a $1bn on a range of products marketed
under the KOLD brand in a joint venture with Coca Cola, but the venture ran out of steam
very quickly and in June 2016, faced with a very limited take up and the fact that the
overpriced range ($370 for a machine) didn't meet consumers' expectations, Keurig decided
to shut it down.
There doesn't seem to be any genuine competition to SodaStream in the soda water maker
category. By contrast the cash cow that the company has built up from CO canister refills for
2
machines faces a serious threat from cowboy operators promoting ways of inserting canisters
that weren't originally designed for use on soda machines at all (a quick search online will
produce a host of guides explaining how to do this). There are also a number of companies
offering CO canisters that are suitable for use on soda machines.

FX exposure
SodaStream reports its results in dollars even though a considerable portion of its sales are in
euros and its operating costs are mainly in shekels, as well as other currencies. As a result,
the company is exposed to the strengthening of the dollar against the other currencies in
which it sells its products and to the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar.
Moreover, because a sizable portion of the company's revenue is in currencies other than the
dollar (~75%), the strengthening of the dollar against these currencies is likely to negatively
impact company results. SodaStream has mitigated some of this exposure through currency
hedges but part of its results still remains susceptible to foreign currency volatility. This
volatility will probably be particularly noticeable this year given that the strength of the shekel
vs. the dollar and of the dollar itself against other currencies is expected to continue.
Unionization of employees in Israel
The staff at the SodaStream manufacturing plant in Israel are a vital part of the business.
They are not unionized although there have been a number of attempts in the past by certain
employees to join a union. If such an attempt were finally to prove successful management
could find itself having to negotiate with a unionized employees' committee and end up
incurring unexpected additional costs for a pay settlement or the disruptions in manufacturing
due to strike action.
Growth drivers and the potential therein
The carbonized beverage market is enormous and the share commanded by
carbonated water devices and accessories is growing ever larger
The carbonated beverages market is estimated at 300 million households, 17% of which
consume carbonated water (soda). In terms of market share, this means that the specific
segment SodaStream is targeting comes to 50 million households. Environmental trends, and
the increasing controversy surrounding the health risk that carbonated beverages (both
regular and sugar free) now pose, constitute drivers that are pushing consumers to switch to
plain soda instead, thus growing the size of SodaStream's potential market share.
As of year – end 2016, SodaStream's share of this 50 million – strong market stands at just
over 20% and our estimates indicate that overall market growth at the same time as
SodaStream's own efforts to grow its organic sales should lift this market share to 25% within
the next five years.
An interesting question is whether the company can kickstart growth again in the US market.
Although momentum in the company business has been positive, the core of its growth
continues to be concentrated in the European market (which is large enough in its own right)
and the US market evidently is still unable to move away from traditional carbonated
beverages. SodaStream's strong 4Q/16 results did provide some cause for cheer in this area
too, since the company reported a 46% increase in sales of soda making devices in the US,
while sales of CO refills grew 7%.

German market is the front runner
Germany is considered a mature market when it comes to water consumption preferences
and most people there drink soda water as a matter of course. SodaStream focused its efforts
on this market during 2011 to 2015 and the results were not long in coming: 300% growth in
soda machine sales, an 86% increase in sales of CO canisters, and a doubling of the
2
company's rate of household penetration. Also contributing to SodaStream's success in
Germany, aside from the fact that it is a mature market, was the marketing strategy it
adopted, at the front of which was the triumphant 'No Schlepping' advertising campaign that
brought SodaStream onto the store shelves at the country's major grocery chains (such as
Lidl, Edeka and the REWE Group). Indeed the campaign was so successful it 'spread the
word' to neighboring countries such as Poland and Austria without SodaStream having to
build a dedicated campaign for the markets there. Yet despite having made a successful entry
(with the company having achieved a 6% market share thus far), the potential in the markets
in Germany and neighboring countries is huge and SodaStream has merely touched the tip of
the iceberg.
Figure 3: Penetration of German market; 2011 – 2015
Gaining access to more store doors is the key to continued growth
Having seen a steady increase in its customer base, SodaStream can now allow itself to
expand its retailer network and move out of large high street stores (such as the DIY chains
Home Center and ACE in Israel), by opening additional points in local supermarkets and
neighborhood stores.
Convenience is the key word here and it is a hugely important criterion that SodaStream
needs to be mindful of as it looks to retain and grow its customer base. If a customer has to
make a special journey by car to buy a CO refill for his soda machine he is highly likely to find
2
the travelling a nuisance and eventually get rid of the machine. But if buying the refill is part of
a customer's regular shopping and can be added on in the same way as soap or laundry
powder, the CO will represent an ideal alternative to plastic bottles. And this is precisely why
2
we are optimistic about SodaStream's growth prospects.

Summary of 2016 and forecast for the coming year
Strong finish to a record year
SodaStream's results for FY2016 underscore the improvement the company has made
across all metrics. Revenue increased 14% vs. 2015 to $476mn, operating profit rose 176%
to an all – time of $54.5mn while net profit grew to $44.5mn. The improvement in revenue
was matched by a corresponding improvement in FCF, which increased to $57mn.
Broken down by segment, sales of soda makers increased 22% to 2.9mn units, while sales of
CO canisters grew 10% to a record 29.4mn units. The growth in soda machine sales implies
2
that SodaStream is set record a potentially large increase in follow – on sales of canisters in
2H/17.
As in previous years, the growth in revenue came mainly Western Europe, in particular
Germany in which SodaStream posted double – digit growth for the 20th consecutive quarter
amid price rises and stronger sale volumes. Growth has also been robust in other countries
across Europe such as Switzerland, Austria and the Scandinavian countries. Looking at the
US, sales growth reached an impressive 20%, a result that reversed the decline in
SodaStream's sales to this market in 2014 and in 2015.
Margins also improved in 2016 on the back of a more profitable sales mix, the opening of the
new manufacturing plant in the Lehavim industrial park in Southern Israel and an increase in
the prices of selected products which translated into a 14% increase in sales, a 106%
increase in net profit, and EBITDA of $75m for 2016.
Figure 4: SodaStream – FY2016 results snapshot
Company forecast for 2017: Growth is set to continue
Revenue growth is expected to be in the high single digit range with FX headwinds likely to
translate into median single digit revenue growth in dollar terms. Gross margin is expected to
reach 52%, up 1% vs. 2015.
For qualified clients only

Operating expenditure is forecast to be largely unchanged vs. 2016 with operating margin
(assuming a fixed currency exchange rate), growing 30%. FX headwinds are expected to
leave their mark here too, with the result that actual operating margin will be in the low double
– digit range. Capex is forecast to reach $25mn while depreciation and impairment charges
are forecast to total $20mn.
Overall, the forecast for 2017 is consistent with the growth SodaStream posted for 2016 and
represents an impressive continuation to the change SodaStream has been undergoing in
recent years.
Pricing and valuation
We are initiating coverage of SodaStream with an Outperform rating and a $56.5 price target
which we derive from the DCF model that follows below. Our model implies a multiple of 11x
2017 EV/EBITDA vs. a historical average of 11.8x. With the company currently enjoying its
most successful period ever, we think the stock is fairly priced and, assuming the EV/EBITDA
multiples remains around the historical average (11.8x), it constitutes an attractive risk/reward
proposition.
Figure 5: SodaStream – Historical EV/EBITDA
Key model assumptions
Strategic change will continue to drive growth in 2017
Our estimates and SodaStream's guidance lead us to forecast that the growth of the past year
is set to continue into 2017. The 28% increase in sales of soda makers will generate follow –
on sales of CO refills thus providing a tail wind to top line and offsetting the minor hit to
2
revenue from the ongoing slippage in sales of flavored beverages. Overall, after discounting a
$510mn hit from FX headwinds, we look for top line growth of 7% in 2017.
For qualified clients only

We model for operating margin of 13%, which will be aided by the increase in prices of
company products and a further reduction in operating costs following the start of
manufacturing at the company's new plant in Lehavim. This will be offset by the strengthening
of the shekel and the dollar. From this we arrive at our FY2017 EBITDA estimate of $86mn.
With the annual run – rate for capex having now declined to $25mn, we expect SodaStream's
cash flow to remain strong. We see this as the representative level of capex at SodaStream in
the coming years given that the new manufacturing plant is up and running and can handle
the growth in orders in the coming years.
As at year – end 2016 SodaStream has $50mn in cash and zero debt.
Figure 6: SodaStream – DCF model
In view of the stable outlook for SodaStream, and more specifically, the company's CO refill
2
business, we applied a WACC of 9% and set our TY growth at 2.5%, metrics that, we feel,
reflect the pace of market expansion and SodaStream's share therein. Using multiples to
value the company leads us to the same conclusion that we arrived at through our DCF –
based analysis: the company's share is underpriced relative to its fair value. Our implied price
objective of $56.5 represents a ~16% upside to the current market price.

Conclusion and outlook
Having endured a rocky period during its first few years, SodaStream now appears to
have discovered its identity and is making a fresh start.
The results for 2016 attest to the strategic turnaround that management undertook with
the aim of rebranding SodaStream as the world's top sparkling water company. We
think the huge potential that the carbonated beverages market holds will continue to
drive the company forward and that the trend towards healthier life style choices
worldwide is to set to become even more pronounced than ever. So it is critical that
SodaStream seizes the moment and redoubles its efforts to extend household
penetration and entrench brand loyalty among consumers before the real competition
appears on the horizon.
Near – term potential is priced in but it's still not too late to board the train
SodaStream has thus far been held mainly by foreign entities and the gains made by
the stock (200% over the past 12 months) have won it admission to the TA 35 Index
where it will benefit from exposure to institutional investors in Israel too. We therefore
expect the stock to be buoyed by the positive momentum resulting from the wider
exposure to the Israeli market and aside from the comfortable pricing, the additional
demand should provide a tail wind as well.
The gains over the past year have indeed been impressive but we don't think that
investors should allow themselves to be deterred by a rise as steep as this. The
company still has quite a way to go before it exhausts its potential in the carbonated
beverages market and the stock is underpriced relative to the company's fair value. As
we have already noted, the turnaround at SodaStream has only just begun and at this
point in time we think it is an excellent investment proposition.

When Mike Duke became CEO he made a reduction in the expense ratio
a priority because bringing down the expense ratio is imperative for
Walmart to retain its position as the low-price retailer. The ratio hasn’t
decreased to the extent expected due to sluggish sales growth, costs
related to the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, to develop e-commerce and
to implement best practices globally.
Costs for FCPA and implementation of best practices may be less
burdensome in 2014 and e-commerce costs will grow but perhaps at a
moderating pace. There should be an opportunity in 2014 to drive down
the expense ratio and for EPS to float upward, if sales are satisfactory.
Doug McMillan became Walmart’s CEO as it needs to be energized so
that EPS growth does not depend primarily on share repurchases. He
Bernard Sosnick will presumably push for e-commerce growth and might roll out small
631-964 -8716 concepts faster. While growth in Canada is planned, the international
 emphasis may be on corrective measures to improve profitability.
Walmart may benefit from a shakeout of weak competitors but faces stiff
challenges from strong ones and newer ones, such as Amazon.

price/mix +8.9%) vs Street +9.3% (volume +2.4%, price/mix +6.9%). Global scanner trends
are +11.2% for Q3, so estimates seem reasonable, with upside. For 2022, we model
organic sales +12.9% (volume +3.7%, price/mix +9.2%) vs Street +13.2% (volume +5.3%,
price/mix +7.9%). We continue to think Street models have lagged the price/mix glide
path. This is especially acute in 2023 where we model price/mix +7.2% vs Street +3.5%.

Bottler price/mix bodes well for KO in FY22 and into FY23
Over the last decade KO has implemented incidence-based pricing agreements with its bottlers, with
KO and its bottlers now aligned behind growing the top line. As such, KO's sales growth is now directly
related to its bottler's sales growth. Pricing is one tool bottlers use to grow sales, but is playing a bigger
part in FY22 as bottlers raise prices to offset inflation.
Who are KO's largest bottlers? As shown below, KO's top 5 bottlers represent ~41% of KO's global
unit case volume, per disclosures in recent annual filings. When including KO's remaining publicly
traded bottlers, the total rises to just over 51% of KO's global unit case volume.

Recent price/mix trends for KO's largest bottlers. We compiled price/mix data for each of KO's top
bottlers (except for Swire), and weighted the data by case volume and geographic footprint in the
table below. Price/mix reported by bottlers was tracking roughly flat through the pandemic (-2% to
+2%), then accelerated to an average of 5.3% in 2021, before jumping to +10.2% in Q122 and +12.5%
in Q222.
On average, bottler price/mix has more or less tracked price/mix trends reported by KO, but we note
KO's price/mix lagged bottler price/mix from Q120-Q121, came in ahead in Q2-Q421 (likely helped by
channel mix shift; i.e., recovery of the away-from-home channel), and again lagged bottler price/mix in
Q122. KO's Q222 price/mix of +12.0%, was only slightly below our bottler price/mix roll-up of +12.5%.

What are bottlers saying on pricing? Similar to KO, its bottlers take a balanced approach to offsetting
inflation. Pricing is a component of the strategy in addition to productivity, promotion optimization
and other revenue growth management tools like mix and packaging. Strong marketing support from
KO provides a tailwind behind the brands, making it easier for bottlers to take pricing.

Beverages Equity Research
In 2021 and into 2022, there has been little negative impact from pricing, with volume elasticity
tracking much lower than historical levels and competitors also pricing as well. Several bottlers are
implementing incremental price increases in 2H22, including Arca Continental (U.S., Mexico), Coca-
Cola Consolidated (U.S.), CCEP (all markets), and Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan.
We compiled quotes from the Q222 earnings calls for key bottlers below. Commentary indicates
that strong price/mix for bottlers is likely to continue through 2022 and into 2023 (a carry-over from
recently enacted pricing actions, plus incremental pricing in 2H), which should also be a tailwind for KO.

Price Performance Summary Investment Thesis and Valuation
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on KO shares. We think Coca-
Cola will benefit from economies re-opening and is well
positioned to reaccelerate organic growth toward the top-end
of its long-term 4-6% range. KO has undergone a deep
positive transformation over the past few years by improving
its sales portfolio, refranchising, and consolidating bottling
assets globally, setting up new systems and procurement in
the US, shifting focus from volume to value growth, and
transitioning senior management. While the multi-billion

• 3Q22 Expectations. We are forecasting 3Q22 EPS of $0.64 (unchanged), which is
in line with Bloomberg consensus estimates. We expect another strong underlying
top-line result and think there could be upside as 1) KO cycles another relatively
easy comparison (3Q21 organic +14% against a -7% comparison); 2) benefits from
pricing actions flow through; and 3) further global away-from-home reopening
benefit and resilient at-home consumption. There are headwinds such as China
lockdowns, exit of Russia, and lapping of bottler inventory stock-up, although we
think guidance was set relatively conservatively and think the high end of +12-13%
organic growth for FY22 is achievable, even baking in 3Y CAGR deceleration
implied by guidance. For 3Q22, we forecast organic revenue growth +10.8% (unit
case volume +3.6%, price/mix +7.2%) versus apples-to-apples Consensus Metrix
forecast +11.3% (unit case volume +3.7%, price/mix +7.6%), although our
concentrate shipment forecast is a bit lower than consensus (JPMe +1.6% vs.
consensus +2.4%) as we model for more of a give-back of prior-year stock-up. We
are slightly below Street gross margins (59.2%, or -190 bps YOY, vs. consensus
59.4%) and slightly higher on SG&A (30.6% of sales, or 52 bps favorable YOY, vs.
consensus 30.4%).
3Q22 Earnings Outlook
Date: Tuesday, October 25
Estimated Release Time: 6:55 AM ET
Conference Call Details:
Time: 8:30 AM ET
Dial-in: +1-888-415-4465 Pin: COKE IR
The Coca-Cola Company (KO, Overweight rated) is scheduled to report 3Q22 earnings
on Tuesday, October 25, before the market open. We slightly adjusted a couple of our
underlying assumptions for 3Q (lowering gross margin offset by more favorable
SG&A), although our $0.64 EPS estimate remains unchanged and is in line with
Bloomberg consensus. For 4Q22 our EPS moves down a penny to $0.48 (from $0.49)
largely due to incremental FX headwinds and a slightly less favorable gross margin –
also in line with consensus. For 2023, we lowered our EPS estimate to $2.51 from $2.64
after layering in additional FX headwinds and multiplier to the bottom line vs.
Bloomberg consensus $2.56.
We don’t think there’s much concern around underlying trends within the quarter or for
FY22 as 2H22 guidance appeared relatively conservative with the 3Y CAGR implied by
guidance decelerating to +4.5% in 2H vs. +6.5% in 1H despite strong pricing actions
and what appear to be largely resilient consumption trends. Moreover, strong results
from PEP’s 3Q22, which featured an accelerating 3Y organic growth CAGR and
resilient volumes (-1%) against +17% pricing, including +13% organic growth in
PBNA, should give investors confidence ahead of KO’s results. We think the bigger
question is looking ahead to how away-from-home (historically ~50% of sales) evolves
if the consumer environment deteriorates and given the magnitude of FX headwinds to
2023 EPS growth. We think KO can apply its learnings from the pandemic to better
navigate a potential consumer pullback in away-from-home and also flex its RGM
capabilities to maintain affordability where needed and premiumize where able. FX

appears set to be another significant headwind to sales/EPS growth in 2023, but we
think the strong underlying momentum should be better appreciated relative to
historical, which could still allow KO to drive some USD EPS growth ahead, although
we lowered our 2023 EPS estimate to +2.1% YOY.
Net-net, we think there could be a lift to 2022 organic growth guidance of +12-
13%, but we are not expecting a raise to EPS guidance given FX headwinds.
From a stock perspective, KO shares have underperformed meaningfully over the last
three months (-8.4%) vs. staples index XLP (-4.0%) and particularly against peers PEP
(+4.3%) and KDP (+5.8%) as we think investors have rotated to more domestic-focused
names with less on-premise exposure. That said, we think the relative share price
weakness represents a buying opportunity with KO shares now trading at a roughly -9%
NTM P/E discount to PEP (vs. five-year average +4.6% premium) and +4.8% NTM P/E
premium to KDP (vs. five-year average +13.4% premium).

We Are Relatively in Line on the Top Line but Slightly below on Margins
On the top line, our +5.0% estimate (including +8.8% organic on concentrate shipment
basis, -7.7% FX, and +3.1% M&A) is ahead of consensus (+4.6%), although we are
slightly below the Street on gross margins (59.2%, or -190 bps YOY, vs. consensus
59.4%, or -170 bps YOY) and slightly ahead of the Street on SG&A (30.6% of sales, or
52 bps favorable YOY, vs. consensus 30.4%, or 70 bps favorable YOY). All in, our
3Q22 and 2022 EPS estimates of $0.64 and $2.46 are both in line with consensus.

Organic Revenue Growth
KO is lapping another quarter of relatively easier comparisons (3Q21 organic growth
+14% came against a -7% comparison) with the company continuing to benefit from
global reopening and resilient at-home consumption, although there continue to be
headwinds in the form of lockdowns in China and the exit of the Russia business, in
addition to lapping of distributor stocking in the prior year to insulate from volatility
(3Q21 concentrate shipments ran 2 points ahead of unit case sales). Moreover, positive
segment/channel mix likely becomes less of a benefit to price/mix as KO laps initial
reopening.
Notwithstanding, we think the high end of KO’s guidance is very doable as the
company seemed to be building in a deceleration in the 3Y CAGR trends to +4.5% in
2H vs. +6.5% in 1H, although all indications are that there hasn’t been much
deterioration in consumer demand trends sequentially and peer PEP saw sequential
acceleration in 3Y CAGR trends during its recent 3Q22.
All in, we are forecasting 3Q22 organic revenue growth of +10.8% (unit case volume
+3.6%, price/mix +7.2%) versus the apples-to-apples Consensus Metrix forecast of
+11.3% (unit case volume +3.7%, price/mix +7.6%). Consensus and the company
utilize concentrate shipments to derive organic growth, and on that basis the Street is
currently modeling for +9.8% organic growth (shipments +2.4%, price/mix +7.6%), and
on an apples-to-apples basis our model calls for organic growth of +8.8% (shipments
+1.6%, price/mix +7.2%) as we model for a larger impact from lapping of distributor
inventory stocking last year. On a regional basis, our organic sales forecasts are as
follows: +8.0% in EMEA (unit case volume -2.0%, price/mix +10.0%), +13.0% in Latin
America (unit case volume +5.0%, price/mix +8.0%), +12.5% in North America (unit
case volume +2.5%, price/mix +10.0%), +12.0% in Asia Pacific (unit case volume
+8.0%, price/mix +4.0%), +13.0% in Global Ventures (unit case volume +10.0%, price/
mix +3.0%), and +10.0% in BIG (unit case volume +9.0%, price/mix +1.0%).

Our estimates for +3.6% unit case volume growth in 3Q imply a deceleration in the 3Y
CAGR to +1.8% from +2.3% in 2Q (and +2.3% in 1Q) as we think it’s prudent to model
more cautiously given potential elasticities and pressure on low-end consumers and
European exposure, although tracked channel data in the U.S. and commentary from
KO’s key bottler in Europe (CCEP, covered by Jared Dinges) seem constructive for the
quarter. From a price/mix perspective, our +7.2% estimate implies a deceleration in the
3Y CAGR to +3.3% from +6.1% in 2Q, but closer to 1Q +2.6%, which we think makes
sense given less segment/channel mix benefit.

(1-212) 622-6735 21 October 2022

US Tracked Channel Trends +DD% in 3Q22 Driven by Pricing, Flat Sequentially
YOY
Within the tracked channels during the period roughly corresponding to 3Q22 (L13W
10/1/22), KO’s overall dollar takeaway trends were flat sequentially from L13W 7/2/22
and remained solid at +DD% with a deceleration in unit sales trends (-4.5% L13W
10/1/22 vs. -3.7% L13W 7/2/22) offset by an acceleration in price per unit (+14.6%
L13W 10/1/22 vs. +13.8% L13W 7/2/22) as the company likely layered on additional
pricing as it lapped pricing actions last August. Overall, though, we think unit declines
continue to be relatively modest in the context of sustained +DD% pricing, which we
think continues to signal limited price elasticity despite pervasive inflationary cost
pressures throughout the store. All in, dollar sales growth of +10.1% L13W 10/1/22
accelerated a slight +5 bps from prior L13W 7/2/22.
3Y CAGR Accelerated Sequentially to +DD% While 2Y Stack Also Accelerated
On a two-year stack basis KO dollar takeaway L13W 10/1/22 accelerated to +20.1%
from +17.1% L13W 7/2/22 with roughly 300 bps tougher comparisons. That said,
looking at a 3Y CAGR, KO’s dollar takeaway of +10.8% L13W 10/1/22 accelerated
roughly +160 bps from prior L13W 7/2/22 of +9.2% and +9.5% in L13W 4/2/22.
CSD Trends Accelerate Slightly Sequentially to +High-Teens% and Continue to
Outpace Peers
In CSDs, tracked channel trends for KO were accelerated modestly sequentially in
L13W 10/1/22 to +17.4% (vs. category +14.6%) from +16.5% L13W 7/2/22 (vs.
category +13.0%) with both EQ volumes (+1.2%) and price per EQ (+16.0%)
improving slightly sequentially (EQ volumes +20 bps and price per EQ by +60 bps).
KO’s outperformance vs. the category of 280 bps narrowed modestly L13W 10/1/22
(from 350 bps outperformance L13W 7/2/22), and the company gained roughly +100
bps of value share of CSDs in the L13W 10/1/22. Value share gains for KO narrowed
sequentially from +128 bps YOY L13W 7/2/22, although on a 2Y basis KO share gains
accelerated sequentially to +110 bps (vs. +62 bps L13W 7/2/22). Dollar takeaway for
both KO and the category also accelerated sequentially on a 3Y CAGR basis to +12.3%
and +11.6%, respectively, L13W 10/1/22 from +9.5% and +9.3% L13W 7/2/22. We
continue to be impressed by resilience in consumption despite +DD% pricing in tracked
channels as we think KO and most peers have been taking a conservative stance on
volumes when providing guidance.

Updated FX Outlook
With the company’s 2Q22 earnings results released on July 26, 2022, management
updated its outlook for currency to be a headwind of -6% to the top line (from prior
guidance of -2% to -3%) and -9% to the bottom line (from prior guidance of -3% to -
4%). Additionally, the company provided expectations for 3Q22 currency impact of -7%
to -8% to revenues and -9% to -10% to EPS. Since the day before KO last reported (i.e.,
7/25/22), the USD has continued to strengthen with the DXY (U.S. Dollar Index)
increasing over +5.5%. KO does hedge G10 currencies, although overall the USD
strengthening portends continued pressure on the top and bottom lines. Based on our
currency model, it appears that FX could be around -20 bps worse in 3Q vs. prior
expectations and -200 bps worse in 4Q vs. prior expectations, and in aggregate for full-
year 2022 our currency model suggest an incremental roughly -60 bps headwind. Net-
net, we updated our 2022 FX impact to top line to -6.3% from -6.0% previously, but our
3Q estimate of -7.7% remains unchanged. Looking ahead to 2023, currency impact to
KO’s top line appears to have worsened by at least -230 bps, and we now model for a -
3.8% headwind for 2023 thus far, from -2.2% previously. Recall, the impact from
currencies from the top to bottom line is generally ~1.5-2.0x, so we would expect
another meaningful currency headwind to EPS in 2023. The current Consensus Metrix
consensus calls for FX headwind to revenue of -7.6% for 3Q22, -7.1% for 2022, and -
3.0% for 2023.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks
Coca-Cola (Overweight; Price Target: $63.00)
Investment Thesis
We have an Overweight rating on KO shares. We think Coca-Cola will benefit from
economies re-opening, and it is well positioned to reaccelerate organic growth toward the
top end of its long-term 4-6% range. KO has undergone a deep positive transformation over
the past few years by improving its sales portfolio, refranchising and consolidating bottling
assets globally, setting up new systems and procurement in the US, shifting focus from
volume to value growth, and transitioning senior management, all of which give us
confidence in the underlying fundamentals of the business. While the multi-billion dollar
dispute with the IRS and FX are overhangs, we think it is already reflected in the share price.
Valuation
We are establishing a Dec 2023 price target of $63 based on 23.2x P/E (5-year historical
average) applied to our 2024 estimates as top-line momentum, better ability to pass through
cost inflation, and defensive nature in an uncertain macro backdrop are mitigated by
ongoing unfavorable FX outlook. Our $63 price target implies ~12% upside in the next ~14
months plus a ~3.3% dividend yield. While the IRS tax dispute and FX headwinds are
overhangs, we think these are contemplated in current valuation, creating a favourable risk/
reward.
Risks to Rating and Price Target
Downside risks to our Overweight rating and price target include (1) negative resolution in
the tax dispute with the IRS (not contemplated in our model); (2) the uncertainty around
when or if the pandemic is contained and its impact on out-of-home consumption; (3) further
margin de-leverage because of inflationary headwinds and/or volume losses; and (4)
increasingly unfavorable FX movements—all of which could drive further negative
earnings revisions.

Wells Fargo Express Takeaways
Investment Thesis
JPMorgan Chase (rated Equal Weight) has excelled at both oense and defense over the past decade
in which it has been gaining market share in all major business lines while optimizing its businesses,
showing consistent earnings relative to other global banks and creating a fortress balance sheet (as
dened by its CEO). Playing defense has carried more importance over the past few years; however,
greater oense is expected to play a role as JPM continues to invest long term. This issue is certain
to us: front-loaded spending in the near term for less certain back-ended benets. JPM continues to
reect our “Goliath is Winning” theme, but the cost and time frame for doing so is greater and longer
than expected. Moreover, JPM is more expensive than the average bank at a time when other banks are
more pure plays on our 2022 theme (""NII to the Sky"").
Upcoming Catalysts
JPM is not holding an investor day this year (the same as 2021) resulting in less interaction with the
company and management than in pre-COVID years. Upcoming company-specic events include
its 10-K release in February (incl. updated interest rate sensitivity information) and 1Q22 results in
April. The Fed's FOMC meeting in March can act as a catalyst for the industry along with intra-meeting
commentary by FOMC members and any change to the outlook for Fed Funds rate hikes.
Risk v. Reward – Upside/Downside Scenarios
Base Case
We arrive at a price target of $180, which implies 14.6x our 2023E EPS, based on the simple average
of six valuation techniques (PE, price-to-book, discount dividend model, PEG ratio analysis and sum of
the parts for both PE and PB). The 20-year forward PE for JPM has been 14x, and we assume a slightly
higher level given its higher-quality balance sheet and earnings consistency overall.

lending), market and interest-rate risks (which can aect JPMorgan's businesses and portfolios in a
.
Upside Scenario
Risks to the upside include higher and steeper yield curve without adverse impacts on capital markets
and trading. For example, if our NIM projection for JPM were 15bps higher than projected in 2022E and
if capital markets in 2022 were at 2020 levels, we est. that our 2022E EPS would be 15% higher and our
target would be up roughly the same (est. $205).
Downside Scenario
Risks to the downside include a lower and atter yield curve than projected, resulting in a attish NIM
(2022E vs. 2021), and if 2022E capital markets revenue were at 2019 levels, then we est. our 2022E
EPS would 10% lower and our target would be down roughly the same (est. $155).

Apple Inc. HOLD (AAPL, $123.73, $115 PT)
APPLE REVIEW: PREPARE FOR SLOWING GROWTH.
PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART
Haiku: Growth may be harder, for Apple to find over, the next fiscal year.
Shares of Apple are down over 7% since the 2015 high of $133.00 reached on
February 23, 2015 despite the company supporting its share price vie the repurchase
of billions of dollars in stock. This includes $4 billion to repurchase 31.2 million shares
in open market transactions in the June quarter, and $90 billion in total share
repurchases since the start of the capital return program. While the market is starting
to express concerns over Apple’s dependency on the iPhone, and growth in the China
market, we mention two other items.
1) Services. Apple makes wonderful hardware and has nicely integrated it with a
software operating system. Its other software products and services layer can be
considered merely adequate, in our opinion. Does anyone really love using
iTunes? Do you truly consider the App store a polished product with curated
suggestions that can’t be improved? Have you compared Siri to Google Now? Source: finance.yahoo.com
Music may have millions of customers take the free trial, but given the resources
that Apple has – isn’t it a bit disappointing to have a product that is similar to
others already on the market? Given the excitement over a potential TV bundle,
should we expect a break out product given the recent launches? Why can’t
Apple build up an advertising revenue stream? And finally, and what point does
owning the platform increase the regulatory risk to the company as it uses
pricing power and the App store to its own advantage?
2) Growth. We are modeling growth on a year-over-year basis to slow starting in
the December quarter of 2016. We are not factoring in revenue from new
products that are not announced such as TV, but we are factoring in an iPhone
and iPad refresh. While we respect that 73% of the installed base has not
upgraded to a 6/6+, and this is going to be driver, the yearly comparison
becomes increasingly difficult starting in the December quarter. We do not see
that Apple has much room left to increase the ASP of the iPhone, increasing its
dependence on growth by driving more units through the channel. Finally, the
capital return program has completed $126 billion of the $200 billion plan, and
share repurchase activity is slowing as the company spends its domestic cash.
The Company reported June quarter revenue of $49.6B. Revenue grew 33% YoY.
International sales accounted for 59% of total revenue in the June quarter. Apple
returned over $13B to its shareholders in the quarter.
iPhone: The company sold 48M (+35% YoY) units in the quarter. iPad: The
Company sold 11M (-18% YoY) Macintosh: Apple sold 5M (+9% YoY) Macs during
the quarter.
Geographical Breakdown: The Company derived 20B (+15% YoY, 41% of total Company Data
revenue) from Americas., 10B from Europe (+19% YoY, 21% of total revenue), 13B

from Greater China (+112% YoY, 27% of revenue), 3B (+9% YoY, 6% of total
52-Week Range ($) 93.28–134.54
revenue) and 3B from Asia Pacific (+26% YoY, 6% of total revenue)
Mkt Cap ($ B) 754.80
Company guidance for the 2015 fourth quarter is $49B-$51B in revenue, gross
margin of 38.5-39.5%, tax rate to be 26.3%, and operating expense of $5.85-$5.95B. Price Target ($) 115
Diluted Shares Out (M) 5773
Balance Sheet: AAPL has $203B in cash ($35.14/ share) and $47B long-term debt as
of June 27, 2015. The company generated $15B in cash from operations. Cash
increased by $9B in the quarter from $194B on March 28, 2015, to $203B on June 27,
2015. We mildly increase our estimates, maintain our HOLD rating and our price target Avg. daily vol. (3mo) 47,025,500

Risks
Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment, tighter credit, negative financial
news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance and operations of the company.
Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile communication devices,
personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating results could be affected badly in case it is not able to
compete in such adverse market conditions.
Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can lead to additional incurrence of
inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s finances.
Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs from single or limited sources.
This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks.
Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its products but also for its
transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty.
For additional risks, see the AAPL 10-K filing with the SEC.

Current Consensus Expectations
---- 4Q20 ----
· 4Q20 EPS: $1.45 [$1.43-$1.47 range, Barclays = $1.44]
· 4Q20 sales growth: 5.5% [+2.3% to +7.1% range, Barclays = +6.8%, +4.5% organic]
---- 2020 ----
· 2020 EPS: $5.52 [$5.48-$5.60 range, Barclays = $5.50]
· 2020 sales growth: +3.7% [+2.7% to +4.4% range, Barclays = +4.2%, +4.0% organic]
---- 2021 ----
· 2021 EPS: $6.05 [$5.80-$6.27 range, Barclays = $5.99]
· 2021 sales growth: +5.6% [Barclays = +6.4%, +4.6% organic]
Our Thoughts
Heading into 4Q20 earnings, we expect 2021 guidance to be a key area of focus for investors, specifically with easing
currency creating greater flexibility in the P&L. To this point, while Street estimates are looking for close to +10% EPS
growth in 2021, we except reinvestment for the long-term to continue to be an important part of the PEP’s strategy in
2021 and look for earnings to be up +9%. In terms of other topics, we expect the abrupt termination of PEP’s distribution
agreement with Bang Energy (initiated last March) to also be a key topic of conversation vis a vis ongoing litigation and
the ultimate implications for PEP’s longer-term strategy in the energy category. Separately, we’ll also be curious to hear
more about investments PEP is making to capitalize on to increase in e-commerce penetration grocery has seen over the
crisis so far and learnings from its direct-to-consumer platform Snacks.com launched last May.
For 4Q, we’re modeling organic sales up +4.5% led by continued strength in the Frito-Lay North America franchise
(+6%), with Quaker Foods North America also remaining robust (+6%) and both benefitting from continued stay at home
trends. To this point, scanner data reflects FLNA sales up +8% (vs. +9% in 3Q) and Quaker Foods up +7% (vs. +5% in
3Q). We expect PBNA to be up +3% with strong scanner data (up +10% vs. +10% in 3Q), offset slightly by weakness in
on-premise. Internationally, we expect Asia-Pac to lead growth (+8%) followed by Europe and Latin America (up ~5%
each) with AMESA flat. Including greater currency headwinds (-2% to sales) and M&A tailwinds from Pioneer, Be & Cheery
and Rockstar (+4.5%), all-in, we model net sales up +6.8% for the quarter. From a profitability standpoint, we model
gross margins down -100 bps with volume leverage in the core business offset by currency headwinds and a margin drag
from acquisitions. We look for SG&A to be down -40 bps with continued reinvestment offset by lower distribution costs
related to acquired assets.
What Matters Most To Us
· 2021 guidance and the balance of reinvestment vs. flow-through to earnings
· Strategy in energy specifically with regards to the recent termination of the Bang distribution agreement
· Incremental color on potential savings from new ways of working through the crisis and reinvestment plans to
support a recovery in markets emerging from the outbreak

Guidance Recap
---- 2020 ----
· Organic sales +4%
· Core EPS: $5.50
· FX impact: 2% headwind to revenues and earnings
· Tax rate approximately 21 percent
· CFO $10 billion
· CFC $6 billion
· Capex $4 billion
· Dividends ~$5.5 billion
· Share repurchases ~$2 billion
---- Long Term Guidance ----
· 4% to 6% organic revenue growth
· Operating margin +20 to 30 bps expansion per year
· Core constant currency EPS growth to be in the high single digits
· Productivity of at least $1 billion annually through 2023
· Core net ROIC increasing
· CapEx to moderate and to return to approximately 5% of revenue by 2022

Guide to the Barclays Fundamental Equity Research Rating System:
Our coverage analysts use a relative rating system in which they rate stocks as Overweight, Equal Weight or
Underweight (see definitions below) relative to other companies covered by the analyst or a team of analysts that are
deemed to be in the same industry (“the industry coverage universe”). To see a list of companies that comprise a
particular industry coverage universe, please go to https://publicresearch.barclays.com.

In addition to the stock rating, we provide industry views which rate the outlook for the industry coverage universe as
Positive, Neutral or Negative (see definitions below). A rating system using terms such as buy, hold and sell is not the
equivalent of our rating system. Investors should carefully read the entire research report including the definitions of
all ratings and not infer its contents from ratings alone.
Stock Rating
Overweight - The stock is expected to outperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Equal Weight - The stock is expected to perform in line with the unweighted expected total return of the industry
coverage universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Underweight - The stock is expected to underperform the unweighted expected total return of the industry coverage
universe over a 12-month investment horizon.
Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.
Industry View
Positive - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are improving.
Neutral - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are steady, neither improving nor deteriorating.
Negative - industry coverage universe fundamentals/valuations are deteriorating.

Guide to the Barclays Research Price Target:
Each analyst has a single price target on the stocks that they cover. The price target represents that analyst's
expectation of where the stock will trade in the next 12 months. Upside/downside scenarios, where provided,
represent potential upside/potential downside to each analyst's price target over the same 12-month period.
Top Picks:
Barclays Equity Research's ""Top Picks"" represent the single best alpha-generating investment idea within each industry
(as defined by the relevant ""industry coverage universe""), taken from among the Overweight-rated stocks within that
industry. While analysts may highlight other Overweight-rated stocks in their published research in addition to their
Top Pick, there can only be one ""Top Pick"" for each industry. To view the current list of Top Picks, go to the Top Picks

CFO Commentary at Sell-Side Lunch & Recent
Presentation
Stock Rating/Industry View: Overweight/Positive
Price Target: USD 140.00
Price (11-Dec-2019): USD 134.18
Potential Upside/Downside: 4%
Tickers: JPM
Overview
Earlier today, 7.5 months into her new role, JPM hosted a “holiday get-together and Q&A session” with CFO
Jenn Piepszak for sell-side analysts. In addition, Piepszak gave her first investor conference presentation
earlier this week. Following we recap our key takeaways from these two events.
Recall, Piepszak became CFO and a member of JPM’s Operating Committee on May 1. She is responsible for a
number of areas, including Finance & Business Management, the Chief Investment Office, and the Chief Administrative
Office. Piepszak began her career at JPM in 1994 in the Corporate & Investment Bank where she held various controller
and chief financial officer roles from 1994-2010, including within the interest rate securities, interest rate derivatives,
credit portfolio, proprietary positioning/principal investment management and its equities and prime services
businesses. She moved to Consumer & Community Banking in 2009, where she was CFO of Mortgage Banking and
Controller of Mortgage Banking and Retail Financial Services. She became Business Banking CEO in Jan 2015 and in Feb
2017 was named CEO of its Card Services business. We view Piepszak as another example of JPM moving around strong
athletes across the company.
Key Takeaways
4Q19 update: JPM expects 4Q19 trading revenues to rise “meaningfully” y-o-y with increases in both FICC and equities
(though FICC should outperform equities). It expects investment banking fees to be stable y-o-y (implies down 8% from
3Q19). This is better than its prior guidance of down y-o-y. The quarter has played out a little bit better than it thought,
largely on healthy investment-grade activity given the rate environment. It also believes it is taking market share. With
respect to net interest income, it noted the interest rate environment has gotten a little bit better, thus results could be
closer to $14.2bn in 4Q19. Recall, it had guided to less than $57.5bn on its 3Q19 earning call. YTD, on a managed basis,
it has reported $43.5bn. As such, $57.5bn for the full-year would have implied $14.0bn for 4Q19, while $14.2bn equates
to $57.7bn. This $0.2bn pick-up equals $0.05/shr all else equal.
Operating environment: JPM sees continued global GDP growth with the Fed and ECB on hold as we head into 2020.
Its believes the consumer is “incredibly strong”, and credit is “very, very good” amid a very strong labor market and a
rebound in consumer sentiment. Based on its own data, it noted holiday spend feels consistent the trends it has been
seeing all year, which is up about 10% y-o-y. Of note, looking at Black Friday through Cyber Monday, spend was up
closer to 20% y-o-y. On the business side, it noted there are some cautionary signs. Still, at the margin, it has seen
some improvement since the summer, including in CEO sentiment. Looking to 2020, in addition to trade, the U.S.
elections will likely contribute to an uncertain environment.
Business opportunities: JPM sees opportunities across the franchise for growth and is focused on building on its scale
and deepening its relationship with existing clients and customers.

Consumer & Community Banking (CCB). Its Consumer & Business Bank should benefit from its market
expansion strategy. It expects to have 80-90 branches open its expansion markets of Boston, Philly, North
Carolina, Virginia, and Minneapolis by year-end. While early days, it noted it is exceeding its expectations versus
historical performance for new branches (in totality, some branches ahead while other are behind). In Credit
Card, the secular tailwind of the electronification of cash should contribute to growth, although it believes there is
an opportunity to take market share. In addition, it has 40mn credit card households and a little less than one-
third of them have a multi-LOB relationship with it. Mortgage has also proven to be an effective role for it to
deepen relationships. It said it is seeing a meaningful portion of its deposit growth in the consumer bank coming
from customers who were previously consumer lending only customers. Interestingly, it is having above-average
success with its Chase Ink Business Card customers opening personal retail accounts as they are already familiar
with the brand. JPM also recently launched two new products called ‘My Chase Plan’ and ‘My Chase Loan’. ‘My
Chase Plan’ is point of scale financing (for example TV, refrigerator), built off its credit card app, while “My Chase
Loan’ allows one to borrow against their unused available credit limit (for example kitchen remodel). It’s a
targeted product feature for existing customers with no application or credit check needed. It believes this
should allow it to compete better against competitors' unsecured consumer credit offerings.
Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB): In CIB, it continues to build scale in wholesale payments. It sees China
as a big opportunity. It is also surgically hiring in markets where it's relatively underpenetrated around the
world. It believes it is continuing to take market share in investment banking.
Commercial Bank (CB): CIB is focused on international expansion and building on the existing infrastructure
that it has in the Investment Bank. Still, it noted last year 40% of its IB fees in North America came from the
Commercial Banking segment.
Asset & Wealth Management (AWM): In AWM, international private banking is an opportunity as high net
worth is a segment where it is relatively under-penetrated. It also recently announced it is combing its U.S.
wealth-management operations for affluent clients, the Chase branch network’s financial-advisory business, and
its new You lnvest online brokerage under common leadership as it aims to better penetrate the high-network
space by leveraging JPMorgan products and Chase distribution.
Loans: Excluding home lending loan sales, loans should grow in the 3%-4% range in 2019. Assuming the environment
holds, 2020 should be in a similar range. It expects strong growth rates in credit card (+8% y-o-y in 3Q19) and AWM
(+7%) to continue into next year. In CB, trends appear mixed. It is seeing good growth in C&I in specialized industries
and expansion markets. Still, this is being mitigated by continued runoff of its tax-exempt portfolio. And in CRE, good
origination activity in commercial term lending, given the rate environment, is offset by real estate banking as it is being
cautious. And, CIB loan growth is expected to remain episodic.
Deposits: It views deposit betas as largely symmetric. On the retail side, it didn’t see a lot of reprice on the way up, so
it expects less of an opportunity on the way down. In fact, it noted in 3Q19 and 4Q19, its rate paid on retail deposits has
increased due to mix shift, as customers are still moving from savings to CDs. Still, it did note CD pricing has come off its
peak. On the wholesale side, it did see deposits costs start to come down after the 1st rate cut (late July) and witnessed
an acceleration after the 2nd rate cut (mid-Sept) and expects a further reduction (Fed cut again in late Oct before holding
in mid-Dec). These reductions have been more prevalent in CIB than CB and AWM. After a slowdown in deposit growth
earlier in the year, when it chose not to compete as aggressively on price, it has witnessed improvement post the recent
Fed cuts. It would expect this improved level of growth to continue into 2020.
Expenses: It continues to feel like 55%, a level it achieved in 3Q19, is a proper efficiency ratio target. Still, it continues
to see opportunities for further efficiencies. It cited robotics and the opportunity to replace repetitive processes,
opportunities to leverage machine learning and AI (already benefit from a reduction in fraud), and utilizing cloud
technology. It also noted teller-transactions are down 40%, while 80% of its transactions are now through self-service
channels. JPM has also increased its technology budget significantly over the last few years ($11.5bn slated for 2019
with half going to investment spend). Still, given it's been investing a portion in productivity, it has opportunities to self-
fund incremental investments. It is also looking to better measure human capital productivity in an effort to improve
efficiency.
Asset quality: It noted asset quality looks “pretty pristine” heading into 2020. Still, it is surgically pulling back in
certain pockets. It noted certain cells in the consumer space look less attractive, while it is being cautious in CRE.

Capital: Despite our calculation that it was in the 400bps GSIB surcharge bucket at 3Q19, JPM said it expects to be in
the 350bp bucket at year-end (which counts for measurement purposes). Still, looking out, it remains hopeful the Fed
will refine this process. Its CET1 target remains the upper-end of 11-12%, while it awaits the final SCB rule from the Fed.
Acquisitions: It would expect to continue to look acquire or partner in areas where it may have competitive gaps.
Recent examples of this include the purchases of InstaMed (health care payments) and WePay (small business payment
processing).

Rating Suspended - The rating and target price have been suspended temporarily due to market events that made
coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations and/or firm policies in certain circumstances including
where the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction
involving the company.

AMAZON EARNINGS PREVIEW: “YOUR PROFIT IS MY OPPORTUNITY”
PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART
Haiku: The margin profile, for Amazon services, may compress in time.
Amazon shares may continue a pattern of volatility on earnings results, as investors expect the
company to report its most profitable June quarter in company history, although we still expect
net income margins to be a mere 1.7%. Shares have traded anywhere from 6% to 14% on
earnings, with the stock trading up 4 of the last eight quarters.
Valuation:
We mention that if we take our 2017 revenue estimate of $158 billion, and generously apply a
10% margin, followed by a 25% tax rate (also generous), and divide by the 487 million shares
we estimate, this is $24.33 in EPS. Using a stock price of $735/share, that EPS gives a 30x
multiple for a company that is growing revenue 16% YoY . The point of this exercise is to show
that even if the company was able to obtain a 10% overall margin profile, one could view that
Source: Nasdaq.com
the valuation is already reflected at current share price levels.
Amazon Web Service:
Regarding AWS, our estimates are revenue of $2.7B with margin of 28%, revenue growth of 50%
YoY and 9% of total revenue. We see risks to growth slowing and profitability being reduced via
a combination of competition, price cuts and overall service commoditization. If one were to
assign the value of Walmart to Amazon’s retail operations, approximately $228B, that would
leave $119B in value for Amazon’s remaining businesses, which are primarily AWS. While we
respect the growth and margin profile of AWS, it is subject to commoditization risk and a
valuation of over $100 billion at its current level seems more than reasonable. CEO Jeff Bezos is
reported to have used the line “Your profit is my opportunity”, and we mention that AWS
competition may seek to flip this around on Mr. Bezos by using price as a lever to win business.
We estimate revenue for the June quarter to be $29.2B, which is growth of 26% YoY and 0.2%
sequentially. This compares to the consensus estimate of 29.6B. Our earnings per share estimate
of $1.05 compares to $0.19 in the prior year and $1.07 in the prior quarter. Consensus is $1.11.
North America: We expect revenue from the North America segment to be at $17.0B in the
quarter for 58% of total, +24% YoY growth and segment operating income of $869M. We
expect Media to grow in North America at +24% YoY for 19% of North American revenue and
EGM (electronics and other general merchandise) revenue to grow at 23% YoY, accounting for
80% of North American revenue.
International: We expect revenue from International segment to be $9.4B in the quarter with a
growth of 24% YoY. We expect Media revenue to grow 21% YoY to provide 27% of total, and
EGM to grow at 25% YoY providing 72% of International revenue.
Media & EGM: We expect worldwide Media revenue to grow 23% YoY to $6B for 20% of total Company Data
revenue. EGM revenue estimated at $20B, +24% YoY growth. This segment is the growth engine

Risks
Competition: Amazon faces competition from various industries like retail, e-commerce services, digital and web
services. These competitors have longer histories, greater resources and brand recognition and more customers, and are
capable of adopting aggressive pricing, securing better terms from vendors and employing more resources for
technology, fulfillment and marketing.
Expansion: The company is witnessing significant expansion in its global operations which has increased the complexity
of the business. This expansion also leads to strain on management, growth, financial, operational and other resources
and also subjects the company to additional legal, financial and business risks.
Fulfillment Centers: It is very important for the company to predict customer demand and optimize and operate its
fulfillment centers successfully, otherwise it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity,
increased costs and impairment charges. This could harm the business.
Seasonality: The seasonal nature of the business puts a strain on the operations of the company. A net sale in the

fourth quarter is disproportionate which leads to inventory, gross profits, net shipping costs and accounts payable being
adversely affected.
Foreign Exchange Risk: The company has significant foreign exchange risk associated with its international websites,
which affects operating results. Further expansion in international operations increases exposure to exchange rate
fluctuations.
