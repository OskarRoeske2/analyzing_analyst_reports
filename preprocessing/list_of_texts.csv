0,1,20201001_Pivotal_Research_Group_AMZN_AMZN-_We_Think_the_Street_Buy_and_Sell_side_are_Lo.pdf,2020-10-01,Pivotal Research Group,AMZN,Amazon.com Inc.,Consumer Discretionary,"PIVOTAL U.S. Equity Research Internet & Media Pivotal Research Group AMZN: We Think the Street – Buy- and Sell-side are September 30, 2020 Looking at SOTP Wrong (Us Included). We are Reframing Why AMZN is the Best Mega-cap on a Multi-year Basis. BOTTOM LINE: We and almost every other investor we have spoken to over the years, has been MICHAEL LEVINE framing the AMZN SOTP valuation wrong. Amazon advertising is only ~5% of revenues, but is far greater 212-514-4682 contributor to overall non-AWS EBIT margins than the street recognizes. Said differently, If advertising was viewed as a stand-along business unit (we will explain why it shouldn’t be), it would represent well north of 300% of 2020E non-AWS EBIT. Amazon (AMZN) Based on our view that there is massive upside by 2024E, we increase our PT to a Street high of $4,500 based on an average of our 2024 SOTP and 30x our 2024 EBIT “power” of $91bn vs. our in-print RATING: BUY estimates of $71.5bn and the street at $69bn- both of these are modeled back at 10%, Overall, we think (Previous: BUY) investors are materially underestimating the earnings power of the business. We are going to be good bulls (not all our colleagues always are) and not factor all of the goodness in our estimates. We wanted Target Price: $4,500 to frame a highly likely outcome, as well as dynamics of the AMZN business that we this not totally (Previous: $3,925) appreciated. As a long time buy-sider, I think one of the most important values the sell-side can bring is reframing an underappreciated dynamic. We don’t think we are going to disappoint. Price (9/30/20): $3,148.73 We would highlight that this is not a short-term call. We do think Street estimates for fulfillment in particular are modeled too low in H121 based on the company’s message that they are embarking on another fulfillment center investment cycle – made loud and clear in our view on the 2Q20 call. Also, we all know eCommerce has seen a massive acceleration from the pandemic, but can imagine guiding could be challenging. Long term, we would bet that over a 4-year period a Long AMZN / Short the market MARKET DATA position will be handsomely rewarded. 52 Wk Hi - Low $3,344 - 1,626 Market Cap. (MM) $1.52tn There are a few observations we wanted to highlight: Avg. Daily Vol (000) 2.5  Everybody who is using a SOTP model for AMZN is doing so incorrectly (ourselves too). We also are not huge fan of SOTP models because the Buy-side or Sell-side makes inaccurate EPS 2020E Prior 2021E Prior conclusions, but in AMZN’s case think is necessary. Why we are not a fan: 1Q 5.09 5.09 9.18 6.76  These SOTP analyses are often done as means to justify that a company is worth more than it is currently trading at, but let us be clear. Analysts may lie – the market 2Q 10.49 2.26 13.02 10.75 doesn’t lie - and the associated price a stock currently trades at is what it is. It can 3Q 7.96 2.93 13.24 10.71 turn out to be true, taking the case of Icahn’s successful push to separate PYPL from EBAY. We would argue there are a lot more reasons that untethered from EBAY, 4Q 9.6 4.82 17.33 12.45 PYPL has been able to transform into a different business than it would if still owned by EBAY. But back to our initial point, analysts may lie – stocks don’t lie. Massive FY 33.1 15.10 40.67 40.67 kudos to whomever bet alongside Mr. Icahn, but this has been a grand slam home run, with PYPL alone at a 230bn mkt cap.  We do not remotely subscribe to the thesis that AWS profits – highly profitable and P/E 163x 60.8x quantifiable – are being used to “subsidize” retail losses. Sales 2020E Prior 2021E Prior  SOTP debates aside, we would all concur that more disclosure is better than less disclosure. 1Q 75.5 75.5 94.4 90.9 This typically leads to multiple expansion given investors greater understanding of the different moving pieces of complex businesses. Examples we would cite are BABA (cloud and offline 2Q 88.9 80.9 99.6 95.3 have been huge drags on a highly profitable core business), NFLX (domestic is highly 3Q 92.8 87.8 108.9 103.7 profitable vs international), and GOOG most recently took a cue from some of these other mega-caps. Ironically, AMZN over the last few years has gone from the mega-cap disclosing 4Q 115.8 111.1 135.8 128.9 the least to the one disclosing the most. FY 355.3 355.3 438.8 418.8  Now let’s chitty chat AMZN. We think the street often tries to ascribe different multiples to AWS (they certainly should), advertising, subscription, FBA, GMV, 1p revs, 3p revs etc. You name it, BALANCE SHEET DATA (6/30/20) somebody has done it. The only reported FACTS we have about OI is AWS, Domestic and International so all the other assumptions are being made by the Street. Cash ($) $71.4bn We have historically modeled for our SOTP: 1) Domestic and 2) International GMV (we gross Debt ($) $75bn up the 3rd party GMV and admittedly are making an assumption on the take rate, as it likely has Debt/Equity 0.98x only continued to uptick given FBA growth), 3) AWS, 4) Advertising, and then have applied a “holding company discount”. Book Value/Share $123 Source: Pivotal Research Group and Company We believe you could nitpick our approach to international GMV. That said, we believe: Documents 1) The company remains in aggressive investment mode – particularly in India – and suspect this market alone is a large % of the international losses Important Disclosures Are Located In The Appendix 2) Based on our channel work, we are of the view that most of the Western European markets are doing MSD % OI margins 3) Unlike China, which was a guaranteed unwinnable fight for AMZN relative to Chinese natives like JD, and BABA, there was a zero-probability chance the Chinese government would allow ecommerce to be dominated by a foreign player. 4) By comparison, we think the Indian government is way more foreign business friendly, and valuing the company on retail OI (god knows how many assumptions you need to make to come up w a clean retail OI number) would attribute no value to international revenues.  We would advocate the investors should essentially look at the business in two primary buckets: AWS and Everything Else  So why do we think so? AMZN is probably the company that penned the term “Flywheel” or certainly made it pervasive in the investment and operating communities. What do we mean? Let’s start to dissect by reporting line.  Retail - The 1p and 3p businesses, while with different margin structures – 3p is much higher and reported only as the net take, are intimately intertwined. They benefit from the same end-customer base. With FBA’s continued expansion and penetration as a % of the 3P business, they often share the same warehouse space, as well as the same logistics/delivery providers. They share the same payment processing and benefit from the same marketing. We have long put zero stock in trying to look at one vs. the other. FBA increasing as % of the mix is good for retail margins and AMZN’s take rate, but to our SOTP comment, we are not going to try and put a different multiple on one vs. the other.  Subscription – Prime – Sweet Sweet AMZN Prime. While we get that investors love subscription businesses because they are sticky, recurring, and have much greater degrees of predictability, AMZN Prime is all about the flywheel. There may be a small base of Audible users or more on the come with its recent Luna Cloud gaming service announcement, but end of the day the subscription business at 19.2bn in 2019 is all about Prime.  Back to our Flywheel comment, the Prime business exists because of the robust selection, and value proposition it represents to end consumers. And to further sweeten the deal, AMZN over the last 5-7 years has only further increased the value of a prime subscription by including an increasingly robust offering of streaming video, streaming audio and most recently, 1-day shipping.  On the other side of the “network effect”, the larger the Prime subscriber base, the more enfranchised sellers are in participating in AMZN’s FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) program. Having the “Prime Enabled” logo next to your item, is a key driver to a shopper’s propensity to click. So back to our comments about Retail, Prime and Retail are intimately intertwined. Within that context, we think ascribing a value to Subscription in SOTP separately also makes no sense  Advertising – As we have framed in our earlier notes about AMZN’s ad business, 1) We think they are the only online player really benefiting from trade budgets today, 2) We believe there was an evolution internally in which AMZN found the right advertising business for AMZN.  We estimate at least 85-90% of the AMZN business today is sponsored listings. In this scenario, an advertiser pays for higher placement within the product sort order, the user stays on AMZN, and AMZN keeps the transaction and transaction data.  To use CPG as an example (we think by far the largest advertiser vertical on AMZN), we think P&G, Unilever, Energizer - companies that don’t have a real DTC strategy -view advertising on AMZN to be not so different than paying for favorable shelf placement at WMT, TGT, KR, etc. The reality is, this is a) where their customers are, b) has better quantifiable results than the offline analog, so have been happy participants.  We think that AMZN could become more aggressive with AMZN Fire/potentially giving the TV device away to further drive their video inventory, but think that this hasn’t happened yet (but who knows – prime day is around the bend), but a development worth closely watching.  Similar to Retail and Prime, we think investors have potentially thought through the Ad business as being a separate business unit, but we think that it sits under the broader retail umbrella to a greater degree than investors recognize. The ad business doesn’t exist without retail.  So why does this all matter? Let’s do a little fun math. 1) FY 2015 North America margin was 4.3%, international was (0.3%) 2) The FY 2015 Other revenue line in totality was $1.7bn (with advertising likely $1.2-1.3bn), 3) Street estimated GAAP EBIT is ~$69bn for 2024  In our view, 2016 was the year advertising had the real break out - with Other revenues growing 74% y/y and advertising growing, we estimate, ~90% y/y.  For context, our estimate of advertising was $13.8bn in 2019, growing 41% y/y to ~19.4bn in 2020.  Now this is where it gets interesting – based on our channel work, and some common sense, we estimate that advertising EBIT margins (if it were a stand- alone) are north of 80%, and believe that could even be CONSERVATIVE.  Running this math based on 2019 actuals, Non-AWS EBIT was $5.3bn, and Advertising if looked in isolation would be ~$11bn – implying that the rest of the business is losing money??!?!?!?!?! We actually think of this as a huge positive not a negative.  As we stated under bullet 4, we think that there is AWS and Everything Else so we look at advertising as another part of the Flywheel.  Valuation is often more of an art-form than pure science, but end of the day what matters is what is the underlying earnings potential of the business.  In our view, we think the key exercise for valuing AMZN, is to do is the following:  Take AWS Revenues and EBIT estimates for 2024 (newly published today) – we are at ~$100bn in revenues and $34.5bn in OI  Assume the “stand-alone” advertising business does $52bn and an estimated margin of 75% (let’s assume they do more around CTV/Fire TV so the margin goes down from predominantly sponsored products, that is $39bn!  So combined, between these two lines, we are already at $73.5bn in EBIT  If we assume that the non-ad components of the north American retail biz are able to get back to a 4% EBIT margin as they were in 2015 (North America was 4.3%), we would get on our estimates of retail revenues of 19.5bn  All in, this is $93bn of EBIT “Earnings Power” vs the street at $69bn – 14% EBIT margins vs the street at ~10%  Assuming we are correct, by 2024 investors won’t need to do these financial acrobatics, because the underlying report EBIT of the busines will show up flowing through the income statement.  Let’s entertain the negative side and see where we could be wrong. Do you mean to say AMZN is back to its old days of selling things at a loss? And don’t they always find a way to keep spending? Well yes and no.  We think this comparison to 2015 margins is a decent proxy to think through earnings power, and are expect international EBIT will be positive by then as well. We do see a few big step function potential costs that are worth framing, and want to discuss where our logic could be wrong.  There has been a huge amount of incremental investment into the business with fulfillment having slowed in 19/18 in terms of order of magnitude y/y dollar growth pretty substantially – we think there is a massive step up this year  Content costs – a straight up gross margin headwind have increased substantially and potentially could again  We actually think a more logical owner of things like NFL rights at the next round of negotiations is more likely to be AMZN, AAPL or GOOG relative to the current rights holders as we suspect we have hit a negative inflection point with linear viewing/cable subscribers. We also think that the potential for one of these tech companies, who each have MASSIVE international audiences to have a big impact on the league’s international presence and brand would likely only further drive this – this would be a huge step up in content costs  One day shipping evolves into same day shipping – as we have been writing about since initiating on AMZN last year, we have viewed one day shipping as a step along the road on the way to inevitable same day shipping – a clear incremental driver of incremental cost headwinds.  The grocery category is clearly one of the last uncaptured categories of huge TAM- particularly in the US. We think that the elements of fresh product, different fulfillment center needs (in part because of perishable), are subscale at this point. But would highlight that 1) we think Bezos’ world view is that he wants AMZN to own as large a percent of the consumers wallet as possible – if they dominate in grocery, they will have largely achieved that, 2) groceries are arguably to last category within which AMZN is not dominant, so see fewer negative new category introduction headwinds and 3) we are assuming AMZN can ultimately get to a ~3-4% EBIT margin in grocery at scale.  Logistics? – we have been of the view for several years, that AMZN has ambitions to compete with FDX/UPS in the top US cities/where they have the most density. We think investors have been paying for some of these investments “along the way”, and think that AMZN has pulled back mid-Covid from their intentions to compete with the third-party carriers, but think this is a function of necessity given the incredible high level of demand for all eCommerce companies. We would be shocked if AMZN is not in market well in advance of 2024 – pricing below their peers. Overall, we think this competitive push would be a headwind to EBIT, but would be favorably viewed as a new leg of the AMZN story.  The ad business is more mature than we appreciate. We think that the ad biz grows correlated with GMV and while we have estimated GMV growth of 13% in 2024, and ad growth at 20%, potentially we are overestimating the headroom in the business.  In summary, we think that most of these potential large pockets of investment (ex-fulfillment build-out) would likely be seen as incremental drivers of revenue growth, so to the extent EBIT numbers are too high, we would suspect the revenue numbers are likely too low.  AMZN long-term skeptics will respond to an analysis such as this that they always manage to spend away the upside, but if grocery is in fact the last “frontier” category, we think they will ultimately run out of large incremental “big ticket” investment opportunities and the underlying earnings power of the business will flow through. WHERE WE COULD BE WRONG: 1) AWS continues to slow faster than we expect, 2) 3rd party fees at 26.7% for 2018 (we model their exit run rate for Q4 at 27.3%) see material pressure. AMZN began reducing some fees over the last 2 months - we are nervous that they could actually be way too high, but don’t know how to handicap magnitude, 3) offline retail is able to strike back harder than we appreciate – we are surprised WMT already had its wheels in motion in terms of a response 4) we are underestimating the size of the investment cycle. Incremental investment for one-day is impacting shipping costs – if they really want to get this right, it could be a material investment in fulfillment too. RISKS: 1) Over saturation of AMZN within eCommerce, 2) macro-economic deceleration causes greater than expected declines in commerce, 3) AWS slows materially, and 4) anti-trust action.

(AMZN) FinTrust Brokerage Services Amazon Revisited Equity Research A New Dutch East India Company or July 30, 2019 Bernanke’s Mississippi Bubble Stock? Part III Analyst’s Notes....Continued • At the time of our initial report (July 24, 2017), Amazon was valued at $1025.67 while BTC traded at $2779 or a ratio of .369. We had a price target of .04 BTC, $640, or .11 gold oz which implied a BTC price of $16,000, a gold price of $5800, or a decline in Amazon’s share price in USD. We point this out given that our initial BTC target was surpassed in December 2017. Based on today’s level of monetary insanity we have a BTC target of $20,568 and a gold price target of $6,652. At today’s BTC price of $9,500.71 the ratio of Amazon’s share price to BTC is .201 and while Amazon’s share price to gold ratio is roughly 1.42. • Fintrust Brokerage Services is raising our Sell rating to Hold, and we are raising our nominal price target price from $1,111 current USD to $1,611 on the basis of our dividend discount model and current interest rates. Our target prices relative to BTC is .078 and our gold relative target is .24 gold ounces in our real purchasing power price estimates. This represents 15.7% nominal downside from today’s price of $1,911. • As repeatedly stated in our reports, our estimates are naturally wide given we are in the midst of the largest money debasement in a “Western” country, since John Law in 1720 or the German hyperinflation of 1914-1923. Our valuation calculations under various scenarios range from a low of $1170 to a high $2550 per share in current USD. The wide range of estimates is the natural outgrowth the company’s high growth rates and historically low interest rates. Discounted cash flow models for high growth companies in a negative to near zero interest rate environment return nearly infinite prices for the value of an equity that invests cash today and promises cash tomorrow because cash today has nearly no value, while cash later, if it materializes, has potentially large value. • Using Valueline, we calculate that Amazon has realized a 10-year historical growth rate in equity of 28%. In addition to our own analysis, we used Valueline’s 2020 earnings estimate of $35.60 and projected cashflows forward for 20 years and then discount those earnings back at 6% and added this sum to Valueline’s estimated 2019 book value estimate ($131.55) to derive a fair value estimate of $2,011. At the current $1,911 per share price, we estimate that the market is discounting Amazon’s like a 20-year monopoly that will sustain a 16% growth rate. • While we understand the market’s pricing for AMZN, we continue to note that one of history’s other great trading, logistics and information monopolies, the Dutch East India company, realized returns of 18% for 200 years, after being granted a 21-year monopoly, but its earnings and dividends were irregular in amount and form. In addition, we note that the company’s stock price reached a record low dividend yield of 3.5% and record stock price high of just over $1100 per share, during the period that coincided with the peak insanity of John Law’s monetary system in 1720. Using Valueline’s 2020, $70.25 per share cashflow estimate for each Amazon.com share and dividing by 3.5% we derive a $2007 price. Importantly for price targets, Amazon.com retains its earnings, whereas the Dutch East India Company distributed its earnings (source: globalfinancialdata.com), as a result, the share price, book value, and our estimates of fair value would be expected to continue to increase over time. Co nclusion, Recommendation & Risk Ou r conclusion, recommendation and risk assessment remain the same as in our previous reports. As rec orded by Washington Irving, John Law’s “System” eventually collapsed as “capitalist gradually awoke from their bewilderment” in the system which was designed to “depreciate the value of gold and increase the illusive credit of paper.” As a result of this awakening, Law was forced to reduce the value of the bank’s notes by one-half and the shares of CDO fell from 9000 to 5000 livres. While the bank notes were restored to their full value, Irving reports that “government itself had lost all public confidence equally with the bank.” (any chance of a collapse in political confidence or confidence in the central banks?). In turn, this failing of confidence in government, led to a massive hyperinflation as paper money was refused. Irving reports that jewels, precious stones, plate, porcelain, trinkets of gold and silver, all commanded any price, in paper while land was bought at fifty years’ purchase….Monopolies now became the rage among the noble holders of paper” (got your FANG stocks?) Law was forced to flee France and Irving quotes Voltaire as saying, “He was a quack to whom the state was given to be cured, but who poisoned it with his drugs, and who poisoned himself.” We can name a few bankers worthy of such modern praise. Should they be so bold as to read this report, we would encourage them to read The Great Disorder by Feldman and to remember that economist used to also be moral philosophers. When you devalue money and remove its ability to act as a store of value – you devalue the man who prudently saved and you steal from him the excess of his labors – as periods of hyperinflation have repeatedly shown, once a man has been devalued economically, it is a short step to his 2 Fintrust Brokerage Services www.Fintrustadvisors.com 124 Verdae Blvd, Ste. #504 864-288-2849 Equity Research Greenville, SC 29607 Special Report - Amazon.com Inc.

The proper moral role of the central bank is to lend against good collateral at high rates of interest during times of economic stress, not finance anything, anywhere, at any time at low rates of interest. If central bankers no longer hold themselves accountable, our analysis of history suggests that they might eventually and rightfully be driven from the country under the threat of tar and feathers. Recommendation: Our $1,611 price target reflects Amazon.com potential growth rate, strong balance sheet and ability to internally finance acquisitions, historic generation of steady gross margins and other financial metrics. Given its modestly unattractive valuation, we believe that AMZN is appropriate at lower valuations for a long term holding for risk-tolerant investors. Acqusitions, if chosen correctly and integrated successfully, add scale and scope in an industry that rewards both attributes, and could potentially drive share value higher than our estimate, whereas competition could compress margins. Given our review of the company’s historic operating and financial results, we rate management as highly capable, and focused. Risk to our recommendation: Risk inlcude, but are not limited to, greater competition for AWS from other technology companies, anti-trust, political and business uncertaintly, F/X fluctuations, the failure to successfully integrate acqusitions, and increased operating cost for a larger proportion of sales. Finally, we believe the stock market as a whole and the value of nominal price generally could be volatile as the system of quantitative easing collapses.

IT Hardware & Communications Networking Equity Research iPhone—Intra-Quarter Data Points Leave us to Est. ~54-57M iPhones Shipped in F2Q22; Blended ASP ($/unit) and 3rd-gen iPhone SE Ramp in Focus Based on our proprietary data analysis / Wells Fargo iPhone index, we think Apple shipped ~54-58 million iPhones during F2Q22; est. iPhone revenue in the range of $44-$48 billion. We consider intra-quarter iPhone-related data points as net-neutral vs. our maintaining F2Q22 iPhone revenue / shipment at $47.416B / 57.47M (vs. street at $48.345B / 57.41M). We expect investors to be focused on commentary around any weakening of consumer demand, especially in China, as well as improvement around the company's supply chain. We will be focused on ASP uplift from the iPhone 13 lineup as well as commentary around the rollout of the company's 3rd-gen iPhone SE ($429 starting price; launched on March 8th). Hardware Subscription Oering? We hope to hear more detail on Apple's reported plans to oer a subscription service for its hardware products by the end of 2022. Investors should be positive on any move toward a subscription hardware model with added recurring revenue and potential for a higher proportion of newer iPhones driving pull-thru revenue for wearables such as the upcoming AR/VR headsets. We would note Apple's November '21 launch of Apple Business Essentials for SMBs, which is designed for SMBs of up to 500 employees and packages device management, support, and iCloud storage into subscription plans. We would highlight mixed / neutral data points below with strong U.S. smartphone imports and relatively weak China mobile phone shipment data. U.S. Smartphone Imports February U.S. trade data implied a continued positive trend for January + February in terms of smartphone imports with imports to the U.S. totaling $10.819 billion, +35% y/y. February imports of smartphones totaled $4.251 billion, +21% y/y. On a unit basis combined January + February imports were 28.272 million, -3% y/y. Smartphone imports from China, which we have seen represent the highest historical correlation with Apple’s iPhone shipments, are +25% y/y on a US$ basis in Jan + Feb; units are +12% y/y. 4 | Equity Research .

We continue to believe that Apple will maintain subscription growth momentum despite the end of COVID lockdowns with potential for a positive mix shift driving further margin upside. We model the number of Apple services subscriptions to expand to ~810 million exiting F2Q22, up in the low to mid-20% range y/y following several quarters of high-20% growth. We estimate that Apple will reach ~960M subscriptions exiting F2023. We will also be focused on Alphabet's Distribution Partner TAC (Trac Acquisition Costs) when the company reports on 4/26 AMC.

We are modeling Mac revenue at $9.011B (Street: $9.094B) and iPad revenue at $7.135B (Street: $7.208B). Gartner 1Q22 preliminary PC shipment data (sell-through) estimated Apple shipments at 7.005M units, up 8.6% y/y compared to an industry-wide decline of 7.3% driven by its M1-based processor lineup. Apple saw even stronger growth in the United States where Mac shipments were up 18.6% y/y (-9.1% q/q) compared to a market-wide decline of 16.5%. We continue to be positive on Apple's ability to pick up share in the PC market, especially the commercial market, as its high-performance M1 processors give the company an edge. We will also be focused on any easing of the iPad's supply chain following commentary that it was severely constrained last quarter. At the same time, we think it is clear that the PC market is beginning to slow / enter a digestion phase. Taiwanese notebook ODMs and component suppliers continue to report low visibility into 2Q22 but with Quanta expecting 2Q22 notebook shipments to increase q/q; Compal expecting shipments to increase in the high-single digit or double-digit q/q range (vs. -20% q/q in 1Q22) and Wistron and Inventec are forecasting shipments to increase in the single digits q/q in 2Q22. 110 28% 50% 26% 100 40% 24% 90 22% 30% 80 20% 20% 70 18% 16% 60 10% 14% 50 12% 0% 40 10% -10% 30 8% 6% -20% 20 4% 10 -30% 2% - 0% )snoilliM( stnempihS 59Q1 59Q3 69Q1 69Q3 79Q1 79Q3 89Q1 89Q3 99Q1 99Q3 00Q1 00Q3 10Q1 10Q3 20Q1 20Q3 30Q1 30Q3 40Q1 40Q3 50Q1 50Q3 60Q1 60Q3 70Q1 70Q3 80Q1 80Q3 90Q1 90Q3 01Q1 01Q3 11Q1 11Q3 21Q1 21Q3 31Q1 31Q3 41Q1 41Q3 51Q1 51Q3 61Q1 61Q3 71Q1 71Q3 81Q1 81Q3 91Q1 91Q3 02Q1 02Q3 12Q1 12Q3 )%( erahS tnempihS .

HOLD (AMZN, $487.25, $475 PT) AMAZON EARNINGS PREVIEW: ANOTHER LOSS Haiku: Amazon sold us, a kindle fire tablet, for thirty dollars. PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Shares of AMZN are up over 10% since the company reported March quarter earnings, trading close to the 52-week high of $493.20 reached on July 20th, 2015. Investors remain enthusiastic on the growing Prime ecosystem, and the fast-growing Amazon Web Service (AWS) that showed surprisingly strong profitability when the company first started breaking it out in the March quarter. Regarding AWS, we mention that the nature of this business is high volume, low margin. This is a business driven by price decreases, and looking back just two quarters one can see that the segment margin was 8.4%, a much lower level that the recently reported 16.9%. Investors who expect AWS margin to continue to improve may be disappointed. We estimate revenue for the June quarter to be $22B, which is growth of 9% YoY. Our revenue estimate is in line with the consensus estimate. Our loss per share estimate of $0.20 compares to Source: marketwatch.com earnings per share of $0.27 in the prior year and a loss of $0.12 in the prior quarter and below the consensus loss per share estimate of $0.14. Earnings are Thursday post-market. North America: We expect revenue from the North America segment to be at $13B in the quarter for 59% of total, +19% YoY growth and segment operating income of $525M. We expect Media to grow in North America at +17% YoY for 22% of North American revenue and EGM (electronics and other general merchandise) revenue to grow at 20% YoY, accounting for 77% of North American revenue. International: We expect revenue from International segment to be $8B in the quarter with a growth of 3% YoY growth. We expect Media revenue to grow at 2% YoY to provide 32% of total, and EGM to grow at 3% YoY providing 67% of International revenue. AWS :We expect revenue from company’s Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business is expected to be $1.6B, for 7% of total revenue and growth of 53% YoY. Company Data Media & EGM: We expect worldwide Media revenue to grow at 10% YoY to $5B for 24% of total revenue. Electronics and Other General Merchandise (EGM) revenue estimated at $15B, Price ($) 487.25 +14% YoY growth. This segment is the growth engine for the company and expected to account 52-Week Range ($) 284.00-493.20 for 68% of total revenue. Mkt Cap ($B) 227.30 Guidance: Guidance for GAAP operating loss in Q2 2015 is a range from a loss of $500M to a Price Target ($) 475 profit of $50M. Revenue guidance is net sales between $20.6B and $22.8B (+7% to +18%). Shares Outstanding (M) 465 Balance Sheet and Estimates.

Our prior target was $425. We maintain our HOLD rating on shares of Amazon Inc. Risks Competition: Amazon faces competition from various industries like retail, e-commerce services, digital and web services. These competitors have longer histories, greater resources and brand recognition and more customers, and are capable of adopting aggressive pricing, securing better terms from vendors and employing more resources for technology, fulfillment and marketing. Expansion: The company is witnessing significant expansion in its global operations which has increased the complexity of the business. This expansion also leads to strain on management, growth, financial, operational and other resources and also subjects the company to additional legal, financial and business risks. Fulfillment Centers: It is very important for the company to predict customer demand and optimize and operate its fulfillment centers successfully, otherwise it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity, increased costs and impairment charges. This could harm the business. Seasonality: The seasonal nature of the business puts a strain on the operations of the company. A net sale in the fourth quarter is disproportionate which leads to inventory, gross profits, net shipping costs and accounts payable being adversely affected. Foreign Exchange Risk: The company has significant foreign exchange risk associated with its international websites, which affects operating results. Further expansion in international operations increases exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. For additional risks, see the AMZN 10-K filing with the SEC.

Revenue Guidance As Low As Feared. No Change To Joseph Galone Apple EPS Est Or Target Thanks To Lower Tax Rate • We are not changing our 2018 CY EPS estimate of $12.00 or price target of $198 as a lower tax rate assumption of 15% vs prior estimate of 19% was offset by lower gross margin estimates and lower contribution from Other income and expenses. • As we previewed in our note last week (Link), FQ2 revenue guidance was $60 billion compared to a consensus estimate of $68 billion just a week ago. The consensus estimate implied a sequential rise in ASP in FQ2, but CFO Luca Maestri poured cold water on that theory during the call. We now estimate a 6.5% q/q decline in ASP in FQ2 versus our AAPL $167.78 prior estimate of a 3.9% decline and yet CFO Luca Maestri appeared to 12 month target $198.00 be guiding to an even lower ASP. U pside 18.0% BUY ""For ASPs, there's also another element that we need to consider. As you know, our newest products this year have higher ASPs than they had in 52 week range $128.53 - $179.26 the past. And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest Dividend Yield 1.2% products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline Market Cap (m) $869,702 sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically."" -Luca Maestri, Apple CFO, 2/1/18, FQ1 2018 conference call Price Performance Source: IDC Estimates 1Q16 A 2Q16 A 3Q16 A 4Q16 A FY16 A 1Q17 A 2Q17 A 3Q17 A 4Q17 E FY17 E FY18 E Sales 75,872 50,557 42,358 46,852 215,639 78,351 52,896 45,408 52,579 229,234 257,417 Gross Margin (%) 40.1% 39.4% 38.0% 38.0% 39.1% 38.5% 38.9% 38.5% 37.9% 38.5% 38.3% Diluted EPS (Adj.) 3.28 1.90 1.42 1.67 8.28 3.36 2.10 1.67 2.07 9.19 11.07 DPS 0.52 0.52 0.57 0.57 2.18 0.57 0.57 0.63 0.63 2.40 2.64 EPS Growth (%) 7.1% (18.4%) (23.0%) (14.6%) (10.0%) 2.3% 10.4% 16.9% 23.7% 11.0% 20.5% Source: BTIG Estimates and Company Documents ($ in millions, except per share amount) Company reports and BTIG estimates Please Read: Important disclosures and analyst’s certification appear in Appendix • Consensus numbers will be coming down for Apple, but as we suggested last week, Apple still generates impressive revenue growth. We estimate 15% in the March quarter and 10% for the Calendar year. • Based on CFO Luca Maestri's comments, it appears that Apple added 4.2 million iPhones into the channel. Its highest quarterly inventory addition ever. ""We exited the December quarter towards the lower end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of iPhone channel inventory, with less than 1 million more iPhones in the channel compared to the December quarter a year ago, in line with our growth in average weekly unit sales."" -Luca Maestri, Apple CFO, 2/1/18, FQ1 2018 conference call BTIG LLC Walter Piecyk www.btigresearch.com 2 • The $796 iPhone ASP was higher than we expected in the quarter. Here is our best guess on unit mix. ▪ Versus our estimate going into the quarter. ▪ As a result, we are bumping up our FQ2 iPhone ASP by $25 to $745 and lowering our unit estimate by 1 million to 52 million, which lifts our FQ2 total revenue estimate by $500 million to $60.9 billion, the mid-point of the guidance range of $60-$62 billion. ▪ We increased our Calendar 2018 revenue estimate by $700 million. A $2.0 billion increase to iPhone revenue (on higher ASP assumptions) was partially offset by lower estimates for Mac unit sales and services revenue. It's notable that we are cutting Services revenue and that growth was under 20% despite the focus of this line item early in the call. We cut some unit growth from our iPhone expectations, but expect low single digit unit growth each quarter. ▪ The weak guidance for FQ2 gross margins caused us to cut our GM estimate for Calendar 2018 by 70 basis points to 38.3%, a 10 basis point contraction from 2017. ▪ We bumped up our R&D estimate by $700 million for the year. It grew 19% this quarter and regularly outpaces our estimates. We expect R&D to represent 5.3% of revenue in Calendar 2018, up from 2.8% in Calendar 2013. No one on the call asked about what the R&D priorities are, but we did get a lengthy description of the HomePod, even though Other Products represented 6.0% of revenue in Calendar 2017. BTIG LLC Walter Piecyk www.btigresearch.com 3 ▪ Our Calendar 2018 EPS estimate would have been cut to $11.44 from $12.00 if the company had not guided to the 15% tax rate versus our 19% estimate. ▪ Share repurchase finally rose to $10 billion and we expect it to stay at those levels in future quarters in order to hit our target. ""Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital structure for our company. Our current net cash position is $163 billion, and given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time. We will provide an update to our specific capital allocation plans when we report results for our second fiscal quarter, consistent with the timing of updates that we had provided in the past."" -Luca Maestri, Apple CFO, 2/1/18, FQ1 2018 conference call ▪ Our $10 billion estimate of quarterly share repurchase might be prove to be too low based on CFO Luca Maestri's comments above. If Apple bought $15 billion of stock back each quarter it would lift our $12.00 EPS estimate up to $12.19. ▪ Tables that compare our estimate revisions are below.

No.: US2021_0009 APPLE INC INITIATION REVENUE Figure 1: Service revenue breakdown Apple has five revenue segments: iPhone (50% of sales), Mac (10%), iPad (9%), Wearables, Home and Accessories (11%), and Services (20%). The first four are grouped under products. Wearables, home and accessories consist of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and other Apple-branded and third-party accessories. Services are licensing, App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iTunes. Service revenue grew by a 17% CAGR from FY16 to FY20 to double from 9% to 20% of total revenue (Figure 3). iPhone revenue was flat in the same period but is expected to surge in FY21 and FY22. Source: Bloomberg estimates Figure 2: Total revenue only grew at a 4.9% CAGR from FY16 to Figure 3: Service revenue growing faster than iPhone FY20 Revenue by product type (US$bn) Revenue (US$ bn) 400 400 350 300 350 250 200 300 150 FY16to FY20: CAGR 4.9% 100 50 250 0 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21e FY22e 200 iPhone Service Wearables, home & accessories Mac iPad FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21e FY22e Source: Company, PSR Source: Company, PSR EXPENSES Cost of sales grew at a 5% CAGR from FY16 to FY20, in line with its revenue CAGR of 5%. Operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses (7% of sales) and research and development (7%). Over the past five years, SG&A consistently ranged at 6-7% of sales, while R&D grew from 5% to 7% of sales. Total operating expenses grew at a 8% CAGR. MARGINS Gross margins averaged 38% in the past five years. Margins for services averaged 61% in the past four years, almost double the product margins of 33%. We forecast elevated margins for both services and products for FY21 and FY22 on the back of higher ASPs of new 5G devices and a higher installed base for services boosting operating leverage. Normalisation of freight costs could jack up product margins further. BALANCE SHEET Assets: Fixed assets increased modestly by 36% in the past five years to US$37bn, roughly in line with revenue growth of 27% between FY16 to FY20. Fixed assets only comprised 8% of total assets as Apple outsources most of its manufacturing needs. Inventory grew 90% in the past five years to US$4bn, likely due to Apple’s wider range of product line-ups in recent years. Liabilities: Net debt averaged US$19bn in the past five years. It was pared down to lower levels in FY19 and FY20 as fixed assets were flat in those years. CASH-FLOW Apple historically generates strong cash flows every year. Cash flow from operations in FY20 jumped 16% YoY to US$81bn from a strong iPhone 12 launch. Much of the cash was used for stock repurchases of US$72bn in that year. Meanwhile, capex averaged US$11bn in the last five years, largely stable.

Customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. Apple sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its markets directly to customers through retail and online stores and a direct sales force. It also distributes indirectly through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. FY20 net sales through direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 34% and 66%, respectively, of total net sales. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Main markets are the Americas (45% of FY20 sales), Europe (25%), Greater China (15%), Japan (8%), and the rest of Asia Pacific (7%). In the service segment, the main revenue contributor is the App Store, which takes in 30% iMac with new M1 chip of revenue from in-app purchases of games, app sales, and app subscriptions. Next is licensing, which includes payments from companies like Google to be featured on Apple products. Other services include AppleCare, which is Apple’s extended warranty service with a price range that depends on the product. iCloud generates revenue through subscription fees for use of cloud data. Apple Music also generates subscription fees as well as revenue from carrier partnerships. Apple Pay earns a percentage of transaction fees from users and banks. New to services and not yet meaningfully contributing are Apple TV, which earns subscription fees, and Apple Card, where Apple likely takes a cut of the interest charged by its partner bank. Source: Company INDUSTRY The high-end smartphone market is predominantly served by Apple and Samsung. Huawei has fallen out of the ranks following U.S. sanctions. Apple’s share of global smartphone sales averaged 14% in the past three years, hitting a historical high of 21% in 4Q20 on the back of the iPhone 12 launch (Figure 8). The International Data Corporation (IDC) expects the global smartphone market to grow at a 3.6% CAGR over 2020-2025 (Figure 6). Apple’s key markets, China (18% of sales) and the US (45%), are forecast to grow 6.0% and 3.5% respectively. Despite tepid market growth, Apple can rely on its consistently growing ecosystem of installed users to outperform the market. The iPhone’s installed base breached 1bn in 2020 (Figure 9), growing by a stronger 5-year CAGR of 7% than the pre-pandemic smartphone sales CAGR of 2%. Most iPhones are sold to upgraders in its installed base (Figure 7).

Antitrust laws could affect service revenue. Apple could lower its App Store fees for larger developers as a result of lawsuits. Apple last year lowered its fee to 15% for smaller developers making less than US$1mn per year from their apps. But App Store revenue is largely driven by its larger developer base, contributing 30% fees. 2. China’s gaming crackdown could hit App Store spending. China’s gaming revenue contributed an estimated US$2bn or 13% to App Store revenue in FY19. That said, even if China’s gaming crackdown intensifies, we believe the impact will be minimal as China’s gaming revenue translated to less than 1% of FY19 revenue. 3. Chip supply shortage. Apple guided for a US$3-4bn of impact from chip shortages earlier this year. This will affect iPhone and iPad sales in the coming quarter. There is a risk of the impact coming in at the higher end of the range. Valuation Figure 10: Our DCF value is US$187.0 We initiate coverage on Apple Inc with a BUY recommendation.

Managing supply chain and FX headwinds well UNITED STATES | CONSUMER | 3Q22 RESULTS 3 August 2022  3Q22 revenue and PATMI in line with expectations. 9M22 revenue/PATMI at 77/80% of our FY22e forecasts.  Record iPhone revenue for June quarter, with growing installed base and increasing customer engagement driving Services growth.  Gross margins slightly above forecasts, demonstrating Apple’s ability to better manage supply chain constraints.  We adjust our FY22e earnings forecasts upwards slightly to reflect higher gross margins and PATMI outperformance YTD. We expect Apple to weather the supply chain constraints and 6% FX headwind. We maintain BUY recommendation with a higher target price of US$198.00 (prev. US$194.00) on DCF with a WACC of 6.1% and terminal growth of 3.0%. Results at a glance The Positives + Record revenue for iPhone and Services. AAPL reported record sales from its iPhones for 3Q22 – US$63.4bn (3% YoY), with customer satisfaction and brand loyalty at an all-time high. There were also a record number of people switching to iPhones in the quarter. The company also mentioned no obvious macroeconomic impact on iPhone sales in the quarter besides FX. Services also set records for the quarter across both developed and emerging markets, up 12% YoY overall despite almost 5% FX headwinds, supported by a growing customer installed base, and increasing customer engagement. + Gross margins slightly above forecasts. AAPL recorded gross margins of 43.3%, slightly above consensus forecasts, demonstrating its ability to manage supply chain constraints better despite COVID-related factory shutdowns in China, and increasing FX headwinds. Products gross margin was down almost 1.5% YoY to 34.5%, while Services gross margin up 1.7% YoY to 71.5%. The Negatives - Supply constraints and FX to impact revenue growth. A couple of headwinds are likely to continue from 2Q22 into 3Q22. For Products, AAPL expects supply constraints to continue, although at slightly lower levels compared to 2Q22 – affecting Product margins. A strengthening US dollar relative to most other currencies is also likely to provide approximately 6% of negative headwinds for revenue growth.

AAPL expects 3Q22 revenue growth to accelerate compared to 2Q22, despite FX headwinds. The company also guided gross margins between 41.5% and 42.5%, with operating expenses of US$12.9bn-13.1bn. Figure 1: Guidance summary for AAPL vs PSR Demand for AAPL products is likely to remain resilient, with customers switching over to iPhones. At the same time, more than half of the customers who purchased its other products – Mac, iPad, Wearables, were new to the product, a trend we expect to continue moving forward, especially with the new M2 chip release and new iPhone release later this year. A growing installed base of AAPL users across all regions and product categories is also supporting the expansion in Services, with transacting accounts, paid accounts, and paid subscriptions all showing double digit YoY growth – creating a flywheel effect. Maintain BUY with a higher TP of US$198.00 (prev. US$194.00) Even with near-term headwinds, we are adjusting our FY22e PATMI forecasts upwards slightly to reflect higher gross margins, and the outperformance for 1H22. We maintain BUY and our target price of US$198.00 (prev. US$194.00) on DCF with a WACC of 6.1% and terminal growth of 3.0%.

Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia) and U.K. small-and mid-capequity research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts’ coverage universe.

Completed 28 Nov 2017 04:06 PM EST Disseminated 28 Nov 2017 04:06 PM EST North America Equity Research 28 November 2017 Holiday eComm Update Sales Tracking +17% vs. Our +18% Projection; Cyber Monday Pricing More Competitive - ALERT Latest thoughts on Holiday eComm and key takeaways from our updated Internet proprietary pricing survey: Doug Anmuth AC (1-212) 622-6571 1) Holiday online sales tracking ~17% thus far–Cyber Monday at +16.8% Y/Y and Thanksgiving &Black Fridayin the 17%-18% rangeaccording to Adobe–and largely BloombergJPMA ANMUTH <GO> in-line with our +18% Y/Y estimate. According to comScore, US desktop retail Ashwin Kesireddy eCommerce spending for Thanksgiving and Black Friday grew 22% & 20%, (1-415) 315-6756 respectively. Other notable takeaways from Adobe include: a) overall web traffic to retail sites was up 11.9% (vs. season avg. +5.7%) & mobile represents a new record of Cory A Carpenter 47.4% of visits & 33.1% of revenues; b)during November 23 through 26,online sales (1-212) 270-8125 totaled $13.03B, +14.4% Y/Y; c)Thanksgiving Day spend totaled $2.87 billion (18.3 percent growth YoY) while Black Friday hit $5.03 billion (up 16.9 percent YoY); d) Dae K Lee Thanksgiving weekend (November 25 and 26) saw $5.12 billion in revenue; and e) (1-212) 622-5673 online spend surpassed at least $1 billion every day in the lead up to Thanksgiving. Matthew R. Boss, CPA 2) AMZN remained the overall price leader in 4 of 9 categories we tracked (1-212) 622-2630 heading into Cyber Monday, but competitors’ price delta vs. AMZN narrowed Christopher Horvers, CFA more after Black Friday. AMZN led pricing in theBaby, Sporting,Toys,and Beauty (1-212) 622-1316 categories, while TGT (covered by JPM’s Chris Horvers), WMT (covered by JPM’s Chris Horvers) and Specialty stores offered higher discounts in other categories. Ken Goldman Please see Table 1 foran overview of ourresults. (1-212) 622-0359 3) Discounts increased into Cyber Monday. We looked at 110 items across 9 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC categories and tracked them across AMZN, WMT, TGT,and across a specialty player in each category. Of the 110 items, 9 items were either unlisted or were‘out of stock’ on various websites for Cyber Monday. We believe ‘out of stock’ indicates healthy demand for those itemsover the weekend,but it also becomes a problem if customers cannot get what they want (Please see Tables 2 through 10 for more details). Of the remaining 101 items, pricing overall had decreased over the last 10 days w/AMZN pricing dropping -3% vs. -8% for TGT, -5% for WMT, and -7% for Specialty. We note that the price delta vs. AMZN has narrowed to 0% from 2% for WMT, 0% vs.5% for Specialty segment, and Target offered higher discounts during Cyber Monday than AMZN.Wewould also note that during the holiday seasonextending through the end of the year, products often come in and out of stock & pricing may change. 4) AMZN’s lead. Our survey suggests AMZN was the overall pricing leader offering the lowest prices in 4 of our 9 baskets. While this may optically look unfavorable after having offered lowest prices in 7 out of 9 baskets heading into Black Friday, we believe that less price aggression after Black Friday indicatesstrong online demand at the retailer over the weekend. We remain optimistic on AMZN's performance this holiday season.We note that Specialty stores have dropped pricing materially as their premium vs. AMZN declined from 5% on Nov 16 to prices now that almost match AMZN.

For important disclosures for these companies, please call 1-800-477- 0406 or e-mail Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatoryor policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation isnot a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia) and U.K. small-and mid-cap equity research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts’ coverage universe. If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying analyst’s coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan’sresearch website, www.jpmorganmarkets.com.

10,11,20221230_JP_Morgan_AAPL_Apple-_Public_CAICT_China_October_Data_Confirm_Industry.pdf,2022-12-30,JP Morgan,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Technology,"J P M O R G A N North America Equity Research 27 December 2022 Apple Overweight Public CAICT China October Data Confirm Industry AAPL, AAPL US Price (23 Dec 22):$131.86 Headwinds and Apple Share Gains Telecom & Networking Equipment/IT Hardware Even though available at quite at a lag with the latest release being for the month of October, the public data from China Academy of Information and Samik Chatterjee, CFA AC Communications Technology (CAICT) relative to the smartphone industry in (1-212) 622 0798 China in the month of October offers further evidence of two widely J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acknowledged, and conflicting, drivers for iPhone revenues - 1) Shipments Joseph Cardoso declining for Apple and the industry y/y, with declines of about -14% y/y for Apple (1-212) 622-9036 if we aggregate September and October to moderate the effect of the shipment delays last year; 2) Share gains for iPhones continuing in the market with share J.P. Morgan Securities LLC hitting a high point of 23% of the market with help from the launch of iPhone 14. Angela Jin Lastly, it is important to keep in mind that the absolute unit sales in the month of (1-212) 622-0514 October do not contain any material supply constraints from the lower utilization currently impacting the Zhengzhou plant in China, and we would expect supply on J.P. Morgan Securities LLC a stand-alone basis to be a driver of worsening y/y trends in November and Manmohanpreet Singh December. (91-22) 6157-5197 Coming back to the October data, International (Apple) shipments tracked at 7.6 J.P. Morgan India Private Limited mn units for the month of October, decreasing -30% y/y. However, if we compare shipments since product launch, i.e. shipments for Sep + Oct, (as the Oct-21 shipments were exceptionally higher due to delayed product availability due to supply chain troubles very early into the launch), they were lower by -14% y/y. For the same time frame, total China market shipments were lower by -18% y/y, pointing towards better than market trends for Apple and a market share since iPhone 14 launch of 23%, vs. 22% at a similar time during iPhone 13 cycle. For the month of October, overall shipments growth for the industry tracked -27% lower on y/y basis. 5G shipments for the month of October were strong at 19.5 mn units, representing 80% of the total shipments. • International shipments (Apple) till October have been lower y/y for iPhone 14 cycle. Based on the latest CAICT report, International brand mobile phone shipments (comprising primarily of Apple) for the latest product cycle (Sep+Oct shipments) tracked -14% y/y till October. However, from a market share perspective, International shipments were modestly better than prior cycle, with 23% share during iPhone 14 cycle till October, vs. 22% in the prior product cycle and historical average of 17% at this point in the cycle. P lease note that we view CAICT data as only a directional view into volume trends, while absolute sales volumes reported by CAICT might differ from actual volumes. • 5G mix accounted for ~80% of total shipments in October. CAICT’s monthly report disclosed 5G mobile phone shipments in China increased +29% m/m to ~20 mn units in October, with 5G smartphones tracking to ~80% of total shipments vs. ~79% in the prior year. For Jan-Oct 2022, 5G shipments, although -18% y/y lower than 2021, were 78% of the total shipments vs. 74% at similar time in 2021. For the full year 2021, 5G smartphone shipments See page 4 for analyst certification and important disclosures, including non-US analyst disclosures. J.P.

Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts’ coverage universe.

Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons.

Page | 1 | PHILLIP SECURITIES RESEARCH (SINGAPORE) MCI (P) 118/10/2015 Ref. No.: US2016_0004 Apple Inc. INITIATION AAPL guidance for 3QFY16:  Revenue between $41 billion and $43 billion, down about 15% yoy from US$49.6 bn  Gross margin between 37.5% and 38%, about 1-2% difference yoy from 39.7%  Operating expenses between US$6 bn and US$6.1 bn, up yoy from US$5.5 bn  Other income/(expense) of US$300 mn, down from US$400 mn yoy  Tax rate of 25.5%, compared to 26.3% last year Initiating coverage with ""Buy"" rating AAPL has had impressive 840% growth rate over the past 10 years, with iPhone as its main growth driver. Despite recent weakness, AAPL is still generating enormous profits and cash. AAPL generated more than US$50 bn in revenue and more than US$10 bn in net income during a difficult quarter. Additionally, its expansion in Services segment could provide support to its future growth. Services has been increasing at an incredible rate, averaging about 20% growth over 5 years, and as AAPL expands its services, users would become more entrenched into its ecosystem. We are Positive on the Company’s long term prospects, supported by its robust established user base and strong balance sheet. Nonetheless, much would still hinges on the Company’s ability to innovate and contribution from its new products. We have a DCF valuation of US$119.37 for AAPL. Investment Thesis 1. Strong Brand Equity with loyal consumer base iPhone sales are the main revenue source for AAPL and accounts for 65% of AAPL’s total revenue. As such, AAPL is known primarily as a hardware company, selling iPhones. The Company has taken steps to diversify its revenue streams. While these steps do show promise, but at this point in time, the impact on total revenue is negligible compared to the revenue from the iPhone.

That said, AAPL mentioned several mitigating factors that could underpin iPhone Sales:  Upgrades. The first half of the upgrade cycle for iPhone 6s has seen a slightly higher rate than the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago. It cited a Kantar survey showing a 95% iPhone loyalty rate. Furthermore, according to Kantar, the iPhone 6 and 6 plus accounted only for 24% of all iPhones being used in US and China (US and China iPhone users account for 65% of its total user base). Coupled with iPhones 6s sales, that represents a sizable portion of current iPhone users that have yet to upgrade to the 6 or 6s, which AAPL could tap on when the next iteration is introduced. This was also mentioned previously by Tim Cook, with 60% of current iPhone users have yet to upgrade.  Switchers. AAPL mentioned that there were more switchers from Android or other platforms to iOS in the 1HFY16 compared to any other six-month period ever.  First timer. AAPL mentioned that India could be the next growth driver and market for iPhones, citing iPhone sales in India were up 56% yoy. While global smartphone market seems to have reached saturation point in developed nations, India’s LTE network is still rolling out, representing a large untapped market. First timers are crucial to the Company’s long term growth. Each new user is a potential loyal AAPL user. Once the user becomes entrenched into its “Eco-system”, the user could start engaging in its Services and purchasing other AAPL products. iPhone SE, released on 31st March was not included in 2QFY16’s results. AAPL cites that demand for iPhone SE has exceeded its expected supply, leading also to the depressed 3QFY16 profit guidance. Should sales for the iPhone SE take off, it would be indicative of pent up demand for cheaper iPhones and an opportunity for AAPL to create further headway into developing markets. Should AAPL follow its previous release schedules and release the iPhone 7 around September (end FY16), it could also entice the large pool of older iPhone users to upgrade as the iPhone 5 and 5s would be 2 product cycles old by then. However, the new iPhone 7 could only start contributing to its bottom line in FY17. Given these factors, we believe that while iPhones will face headwinds in the increasingly saturated developed nations’ smartphone market, the fears of “peak iPhone” are APPLE INC. INITIATION overblown and believe that there is potential for iPhone sales to grow in the future, albeit at a slower rate. (b) iPad Revenue AAPL’s tablet offering; the iPad, used to account for about 18% of AAPL’s total revenue. However, the rapid growth of iPhones and falling iPad sales has led to iPad now making up only 10% of AAPL’s total revenue. Tablets have longer replacement cycles compared to smartphones as consumers are less compelled to upgrade their tablets compared to smartphones. In 2QFY16, AAPL reported iPad sales were down 19% yoy with unit sales of 10.25 mn. iPad sales were slightly better Source: Apple than consensus estimates which were on average about 9.95 mn. Of note however, the new 9.7 inch iPad Pro was only released at the end of Q2 2016 and sales figures would not have captured the full extent of demand. AAPL expects the next quarter to be the best iPad quarter in two years based on their estimates. For now, we expect the iPad to continue accounting for a smaller component of AAPL’s revenue over time. Figure 05: Source: Company (c) Mac Revenue Macs are AAPL’s laptops offering, they account for 11% of AAPL’s revenue. Mac unit sales have been on the uptrend over the past 3 years as the Macbook has gained popularity and more mainstream acceptance. However, Macbook sales fell 9% yoy in 2QFY16, which was worse than consensus estimates. However, a silver lining is that AAPL is gaining traction in China, where 80% of the Chinese Mac buyers were purchasing for the first time. Management has given guidance that it expects Mac sales to increase in 3QFY16 on the Source: Apple back of an updated Macbook, which was thinner and lighter with better specs. As one of AAPL core offerings, we expect Mac sales to maintain its share of revenue as it gains traction as a viable alternative to PCs. We believe that Mac sales will increase as compared to the iPad, despite both having similarly long replacement cycles compared to iPhone due to Mac having greater functionality. Page | 5 | PHILLIP SECURITIES RESEARCH (SINGAPORE) APPLE INC. INITIATION Figure 06: Source: Company (d) Other Products Apple Watch led to a 30% yoy growth in Other Product revenue, since it is a relatively new product offering, the Watch has generated new avenues of revenue for AAPL. Whether the take up rate can continue or the Watch becoming like the iPad in terms of replacement rate remains to be seen. 2. Transition to Services Revenue from Services rose 20% yoy to US$6 bn in 2QFY16. “Apple as a service” is a concept that AAPL has taken large steps towards and is increasingly becoming the bright spot in the current environment of stalling hardware sales. Services create the “Eco- system” which allows AAPL to further entrench its user base, creating more reasons for its “stickability”. AAPL has been showing that it is increasingly able to monetize that active user base to generate more revenue from its services. In the 1QFY16, AAPL revealed that it had 1 bn active installed base, devices that were actively engaged in Services within that quarter, leading to Installed Base Related Purchases of US$8.9 bn. This figure grew by 27% yoy to US$9.9 bn in the March quarter.  App Store. Revenue grew by 35% yoy, generating 90% more global revenue than Google Play.  Apple Music. Music grew from 10 mn to 13 mn paying subscribers since introducing a download and streaming model, leading AAPL to be optimistic that Apple Music revenue will start growing again moving forward.  Apple Pay. Being very new, Apple Pay is not expected to make significant contribution to AAPL’s FY16 revenue. However, adoption rate is increasing exponentially, with transactions volume growing by 500% yoy. AAPL has launched over 2.5 mn locations that accept Apple Pay, with plans to expand further. While usage rates remain low, as the idea of NFC (Near Field Communication) payment is still new and not widely adopted yet, there is still much room for growth and eventually monetization. However, with credit card companies like Visa, as well as other phone companies like Samsung, are also heading into the space, the idea of NFC payments might not take that long to be legitimized. As such, we view this as an avenue with great potential in the future. Page | 6 | PHILLIP SECURITIES RESEARCH (SINGAPORE) APPLE INC. INITIATION Overall, we see great potential in “Apple as a service”. It remains the one category of revenue that AAPL has been able to achieve consecutive double-digit growth, on average about 20%, over the past 5 years. Services provide recurring revenue stream for AAPL that could grow independent of the unit sales, making it especially helpful in the current environment of slowing hardware sales. We expect Services revenue to continue to grow and become a greater part of AAPL’s revenue as upgrade cycles for iPhones stretch to 2-3 years. Of note though, is China’s recent ban of AAPL iBooks and iTunes Movies, which could be a potentially worrying trend. Considering that if Services are to be the future of AAPL and China’s important role in this strategy, then it would be a huge detriment to AAPL’s future growth if the ban expands to the rest of AAPL’s services. For now however, with just the iBooks and iTunes Movies ban, while worrying, it is not a large dent in AAPL’s services growth and the thesis of Service growth should still hold. Figure 7: Source: Company 3. Rising consumer affluence in developing nations AAPL main revenue source by region comes from Americas, which makes up 40% of the total revenue. While Americas’ contribution to AAPL’s revenue has been increasing on an absolute value, it has not been growing at a very fast pace. Americas’ revenue grew 4% in 2014 when total revenue grew 7%, and grew at 17% yoy in 2015 when total revenue grew at 28%. It is likely that Americas’ revenue will continue to grow at a slower pace as compared to the total revenue. On the other hand, Greater China, which currently makes up 25% of its total revenue, has been rising at an incredibly fast pace. In 2014, Greater China only made up 17.4%, this represents an 84% yoy increase. In the 2QFY16, China had a qoq change of -32% from 1QFY16, and a yoy change of -26%. China was the main reason for AAPL’s explosive growth in the previous year, growing by 84% yoy in FY15. In comparison, 2QFY16’s results appears dismal, coming in at US$12.5 bn vs previous year’s US$16.8 bn. When seen against the backdrop of such a breakout year previously, it is not surprising that investors have reacted negatively to AAPL’s performance this quarter in China. However, we feel that this is less of a slowdown and more of a normalization of AAPL’s sales in China. AAPL’s YTD revenue from China stands at roughly US$30.8 bn, already almost as much as FY14, where revenue from China was US$31.8 bn. As LTE network continues to expand in China and adoption increases, we expect China’s demand for iPhones to continue to grow. However, whether China adopts the same replacement rate that Americas has had over the past years remains to be seen. Regardless, China should continue to be a growing source of revenue for AAPL. As mentioned earlier, India is also a developing market which could provide avenues of future growth for AAPL, sales having grown 56% yoy. As LTE networks continue to rollout, smartphones become more useable as compared to 2.5G or 3G networks, leading to increase demand. APAC ex Japan accounted only for US$15 bn, being home to more developing nations, but as those nations continue to develop, AAPL should be able to take advantage of improvements in infrastructure to expand there.

Strong Balance Sheet AAPL has amassed a large amount of cash, with US$232.9 bn in cash and marketable securities as of 31 Mar 2016, up almost US$20 bn yoy. However, 90% of this cash hoard is outside the USA. This is significant due to USA tax laws, which would cause AAPL to have to pay upwards of about US$60 bn if it was to remit back to the USA. AAPL has thus taken advantage of the current low interest rate environment to take on more debt. AAPL issued another US$15.5 bn in USD notes in the latest quarter, bringing its debt level to about US$72 bn. This puts its current net cash position at about US$160 bn, which is equivalent to about US$30 per share. Most of the borrowings has been put to fund the Capital return program, mainly dividends and share buybacks. Page | 8 | PHILLIP SECURITIES RESEARCH (SINGAPORE) APPLE INC. INITIATION 5. Attractive Capital Return Program Dividends and buyback increased. AAPL announced a further increase to its capital return program on 26th April 2016, increasing it to US$250 bn from US$200 bn in April 2015. The dividend was increased to US$0.57 per share for shareholders on close of business 9th May- 16, up c.10% from US$0.52. Since AAPL started paying a dividend in 2012, it has increased the dividend each year consecutively, from US$0.38 per share to US$0.52, with a CAGR of about 8%p.a. This represents a payout ratio of about 24%, which is relatively low, indicating that there is still substantial room for future dividend growth. Share repurchase authorization was also increased from US$140 bn to US$175 bn. Valuation Valuation Methodology: Discounted Free Cash Flow Model DCF model was used to derive a valuation of AAPL’s intrinsic value. We have made the following assumptions for the model:  Headwinds in iPhone sales leading to decline and slow growth over the next two years, after which iPhone sales should start growing at a slower rate  iPad sales may pick up in the next FY but repeat the cycle of slow replacement, leading to flat revenue  Increase in Mac take up as Macbooks gain traction and more mainstream acceptance as PC and laptop replacements  Service Revenue will increase as AAPL expands their ecosystem and continues to increase the monetization of their user base We initiate coverage for AAPL with a “Buy” rating with a target price of US$119.37, derived from our DCF estimates.

While AAPL’s customer base is very loyal, if iPhone 7 has a lacklustre showing and fails to excite that base, it could lead to even lower take up and a longer replacement cycle. Weaker consumer sentiment amidst slowdown in the global economy could also negatively impact the take up of iPhones. Slowdown in Services. Services have been growing at an incredible rate and been the one bright spot in the 2QFY16. AAPL transitioning into more of a Services company rather than a Hardware company also forms the basis for our estimates of future growth. If Services revenue slows down or if consumers fail to become entrenched into AAPL’s ecosystem, it would adversely affect AAPL and our valuations.

As such, we have chosen to show Google and Microsoft as peer comparisons. Google is relevant for the Android comparison and Microsoft is relevant for the Windows phone, PC and its recent move into a Service company as well. AAPL remains the largest of the three companies by market cap. Based on PER, it is also the more undervalued stock amongst the three, trading at about 10x PER while the other two trade at more than 30x PER. AAPL, at US$92.79, is also trading near its 52 week low of US$91.85. Based on the Historical PER chart below, it is also trading at near 8 year low valuations. At US$92.79, AAPL is trading at 10.32x PER as compared to its 5-year historical average of 13.7x PER. Figure 12: Historical PER Chart Source: Bloomberg Conclusion AAPL gave poor guidance for 3QFY16, citing continued macro headwinds sending AAPL shares tumbling down. We expect AAPL’s share price to remain depressed in the short term, while the market reacts bearishly to AAPL prospects and fears on iPhone’s saturation. However, AAPL’s balance sheet remains strong with net cash at almost US$160 bn, which works out to almost US$30 net cash per share. At current prices, that indicates a net price US$60 per share, indicating a c.7x FY16e PER. Additionally, its brand equity and loyal consumer base allows AAPL to continue to generate large profits and cash flow even in difficult seasons. Its growing Services revenue is promising as it shows AAPL is making headway in their transition to a Services company. Therefore, we believe that the current knee jerk reaction in the market to AAPL is overblown, leading to AAPL being undervalued. As such, we initiate a “Buy” rating on AAPL with a Target Price of US$119.37, indicating about a 28% upside to the share (excluding dividends). APPLE INC.

(AMZN) BUY Prime, FBA, and AWS Stock Rating INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS: $1U,n1c5ha0n.g0e0d Price Target Amazon reported mixed 2Q17 results with revenue above and operating income below expectations. While the miss on operating income is disappointing, we believe this creates a buying opportunity. We believe the company's Internet & Digital Media underlying fundamentals remained intact with continued strong demand for Prime, Kerry Rice FBA, and AWS. Both 1P and 3P revenue, as well as total paid units accelerated during the quarter, driven by continued momentum in Prime membership as retail subscription revenue accelerated. We believe FBA program continued to gain traction both domestically and internationally. AWS continued to grow over 40% y/y. We believe Jinjin Qian, CFA the company's ongoing heavy investments in fulfillment capacity, video content, and ■ AWS are to match with its substantial growth rates, and should not be viewed negatively. Amazon reported 2Q17 revenue of $38.0B, representing 25% y/y growth or 26% y/y ex-FX, above consensus of $37.2B. N. America revenue was $22.4B, above consensus of $21.7B, representing growth of 27% y/y ex-FX, an acceleration from 23% ex-FX in 1Q17. International revenue was $11.5B, up 22% y/y ex-FX, in-line with consensus. AWS continued to ramp with revenue growing 42% y/y to $4.1B in Q2, also in-line with consensus. Overall, we estimate Q2 GMV to be $79.7B, increasing 30% y/y. GAAP operating income was $628M in 2Q17, below consensus of $1.1B, primarily driven by step-up in investments in fulfillment, video content, and AWS infrastructure, as ■ well as increased sales force related to AWS and Advertising. In terms of revenue mix, retail subscription revenue totaled $2.2B, up 53% y/y ex-FX, indicating continued growth momentum in Prime membership. According to latest estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), U.S. Prime members reached 85M in 2Q17 and 28% of U.S. Prime members are monthly subscribers. We estimate global Prime members to be over 100M, taking into account monthly ■ subscribers and lower international pricing. In Q2, third-party (3P) retail revenue continued to outpace growth of first-party (1P) revenue, up 40% y/y ex-FX, compared to 18% y/y ex-FX for 1P. Both 1P and 3P revenue accelerated q/q with particular strength in U.S. 3P units grew Price (USD) 32% y/y and 3P units now represents 51% of total paid units, up from 49% in 2Q16. We believe FBA program continued to gain traction both domestically and internationally. Management mentioned that Amazon fulfilled units increased nearly 40% y/y while fulfillment center square footage increased by 30% y/y. We believe company should continue increasing its fulfillment capacity to match with its FBA demand and expect ongoing heavy investment in Q3 ahead of the holiday season.

Needham & Company, LLC July 28, 2017  GAAP operating income margin was 1.7% for 2Q17, decreasing 250 bps y/y from 4.2% in 2Q16. Apart from continued investments in fulfillment capacity, video content, and AWS, the lower margin this quarter was also driven by a step-up in headcount which grew 42% y/y and 51% y/y growth stock compensation. Growth in hiring for AWS and Advertising exceeded overall company growth, in areas including software engineers and sales. Management expects seasonally low operating income for Q3, as the company brings ~80% of this year's fulfillment square footage online, and as it steps up its video spend both y/y and q/q.  AWS continued to exhibit strong growth in 2Q17, increasing 42% y/y to reach revenue of $4.1B, despite relatively recent price reductions Operating margin for AWS was 22.3%, down q/q from 24.3% due to new price cuts during the quarter. AWS margin was also impacted by 71% increase in capital leases as it stepped up its infrastructure investment to match large usage growth and geo expansion. The company also increased its marketing expense due to sales hiring. In the long run, however, we believe AWS margin should continue to trend upwards given increasing utilization and operational efficiency.  Amazon guided 3Q17 revenue of $39.25-41.75B, which represents growth of 20-28% y/y, with the midpoint above consensus of $40.0B. GAAP operating income guidance for 3Q17 was ($400)-300M, below consensus of $931M. We believe guidance could prove conservative given strong Prime, 3P, and AWS growth, as well as strong performance of Amazon Prime Day in July.

PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART The smartphone market, could converge to the growth rate, of the phone market. Apple reported upside September quarter results that were once again driven by strong performance in iPhone sales, partially offset by a continued decline in sales of the iPad. The company reported iPhone unit sales of 39.3 million, growth of 21.8% on a revenue basis and 16.2% on a unit basis. We mention the unit growth remains materially below the IDC industry growth rate of 25.3%. Given that Apple is generating the majority of its revenue and profits from sales of the iPhone, we mention a few statistics taken from IDC data: 1) The total growth of the mobile phone market (feature and smart phones) was 4.8% in 2013 (1.82 billion units). 2) Smartphones have passed over 50% of mobile phone shipments, representing 55.1% of total in 2013. Source: finance.yahoo.com 3) The smartphone market itself is slowing, from 46.6% in 2012, to 38.5% in 2013, the to 25% rate in the June quarter of 2014. 4) Android took 84.7% market share in the June quarter, with iOS at 11.7% and we do not expect the iPhone 6 to materially change this dynamic. 5) Apple was able to increase its ASP to $605 in the September quarter. This compares to 58.6% of the Android shipments in the June quarter costing less than $200 off contract. Apple commands a price more than double the average selling price of the broader market. We mention these points to highlight that Apple’s current dependence on iPhone hardware sales may be a looming headwind. The market dynamics for smartphone growth is slowing and may converge to the 5% growth rates of the overall mobile phone market. For us to turn more positive on Apple shares we prefer to see a stronger recurring revenue stream with a monthly component coming from streaming music and movie, payments and advertising. We understand the company is positioning for these markets, and it remains to be seen if Apple can build up a robust service layer before the smartphone product cycle elongates. Apple reported September quarter revenue of $42.1B. Revenue grew 12.4% YoY. Revenue for the FY 2014 was 182 B (+7% YoY) International sales accounted for 61.4% of total revenue in the September quarter and 64.3% for the full year. Apple returned over $19B to its shareholders in the September quarter. iPhone: The company sold 39.2M (+12% YoY) units in the September quarter. Macintosh: Apple sold 5.5M (+25% YoY) Macs during the quarter. iPad: Unit sales and revenue declined for the third consecutive quarter. iPad revenue was the 5th worst level of the 18 quarters the product has been in existence, with the only quarters being lower the initial four quarters at launch. There are now over 50 models of the Company Data iPad compared to just a handful at launch. Unit sales of 12.3 million were the lowest in 10 quarters, and a warning signal to what the future could hold for the smartphone Price ($) 101.92 market. Company guidance for the fiscal 2015 first quarter is $63.5-$66.5B in 52-Week Range ($) 70.51 – 103.74 revenue, gross margin of 37.5-38.5%, tax rate to be 26.5%, and operating expense of Mkt Cap ($ B) 610.58 $5.4-$5.5B.

Data is based on fiscal year ending September. Risks Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment, tighter credit, negative financial news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance and operations of the company. Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile communication devices, personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating results could be affected badly in case it is not able to compete in such adverse market conditions. Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can lead to additional incurrence of inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s finances. Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs from single or limited sources. This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks. See page 9 for important disclosures and disclaimers 9 October 21, 2014 Colin W. Gillis Technology Analyst / Director 646.346.7052 cell: 917.921.8616 BGC Financial L.P. Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its products but also for its transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty. For additional risks, see the AAPL 10-K filing with the SEC.

Our new estimates imply 4% EPS growth in Fiscal 2019 despite an expected 5% decline in Net Income, thanks to the share repurchase program. $25 billion iPhone revenue cut to our Fiscal 2019 iPhone revenue estimate based on a 31.5 million (14%) cut to our estimate of iPhone units sold. Our estimates now imply a 12% decline in iPhone revenue and 15% decline in units sold in Fiscal 2019. 12.5 million miss on iPhones sold in December quarter - We estimate iPhone units sales were less than 64 million in the December quarter, an 18% decline from last year. That's the largest decline in unit sales since the March 2016 quarter following the launch of the iPhone 6S when unit sales declined 16%. We expect iPhone unit sales to drop to 42.5 million in the March quarter, reflecting typical seasonal declines and implying a 19% decline from the prior year. This is clearly an important metric and one that Apple said they would no longer report when they issued guidance 63 days ago. It is not helpful to investors to not report this metric. Subsidies? CEO Tim Cook primarily cited a weakening economy in China as the reason for the revenue shortfall and the environment sounds very bad there and obviously not being helped by the ongoing trade war or the rising prices of Apple's products. Cook also noted the lack of subsidies by wireless operators in developed markets. That is not a new trend. On CNBC, Cook suggested that trade-ins offered by Apple can act as an effective subsidy, but operators have been offering trade-in promotions for years, albeit at lower levels in the past two years. (Link) There has not been evidence of an incremental acceleration in the decline in upgrade rates in the United States or other developed markets. The replacement cycle might not be rebounding, but it's very hard to believe that a further lengthening in the product cycle is a material contributor to the miss reported this afternoon. 0.0% revenue growth is our new expectation for Fiscal 2019, but we believe Apple can return to revenue growth in the June quarter. Too bad they won't report that for more than six months. 19% growth in everything else. The huge miss in iPhone was offset by upside to other segments. In aggregate, Apple’s other product segments generated $1.75 billion (6%) of upside to our estimate. We estimate that the upside was generated from wearables, services and iPads as detailed in the tables below. We adjusted our forward estimates in these segments accordingly. Gross margin of 38% was at the low end of the guided range and reflected some contraction from last year. We cut our future gross margin estimates by 50 basis points. Guidance on this line item given the lower revenue expectations will be critical. 500 million shares could be bought. We are maintaining our expectation that Apple will buy back ~$20 billion of stock each quarter, but have adjusted the share repurchase price based on the move in the stock. As a result, we now expect Apple to buy back 503 million shares in calendar 2019, which represents 11% of the FQ1 share count of 4.77 billion shares. BTIG LLC Walter Piecyk www.btigresearch.com 2 We cut our price target to $197 from $235 million based on our 15.0x (was 16.5x) our new calendar 2019 EPS estimate of $13.12 (was $14.25). The S&P 500 trades at a 14.4x multiple of expected consensus EPS from FactSet. Our target also implies a free cash flow yield of 7.3% (was 6.5%).

SELL (AAPL, $103.41, $85 PT) APPLE EARNINGS REVIEW: BUILDING UP THE CHANNEL PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Haiku: While the stock is up, the underlying metrics, are all in decline. Shares of Apple are up as the company produced June quarter results ahead of low consensus and issued September quarter guidance ahead of expectations. While the stock is materially rallying on the results, the underlying metrics that drive our sell rating are in still intact. These include: 1) Revenue decline of 15% YoY in the June quarter and our expectation of a decline of 8% in the September quarter, even at the upper end of company guidance. 2) We estimate FY2016 revenue declines 8% and FY2017 revenue declines 1%, and our bias remains to the downside. We see that it is more likely that the market for smartphones decelerates than accelerates. 3) September quarter guidance likely includes the benefit of building up channel inventory, which was decreased in the June quarter by 4 million units. 4) Channel inventory build may negatively impact December quarter results. 5) iPhone revenue declined for the second consecutive quarter, and we estimate Source: Nasdaq.com that iPhone revenue to decline for the next 5 quarters on a year over year basis. 6) Average selling price for the iPhone dropped 10% YoY and 7% sequentially, driven by customer interest in lower priced iPhone SE, resulting in the lowest gross margins in 7 quarters. 7) Operating margin of 23.9% was the lowest in 7 years. 8) Greater China revenue declined 33% YoY and 29% sequentially, and even with adjustments for currency, we note the market declined in a quarter where the low cost iPhone SE was released. 9) Only two areas of the company produced revenue growth, iPad and Services. Services revenue, while touted by management, is only 14% of total. iPad revenue grew although units sold declined driven by higher ASPs. 10) Domestic cash is down to 7% of total, at $17 billion, a 29% sequential decline, limiting flexibility as the company returned $13 billion in the quarter, with a dividend commitment of $3.2 billion per quarter. Debt is $72 billion. 11) Shares keep making lower lows, and lower highs looking back to 2015, and remains precipitously subject to the consumer whim regarding the iPhone. 12) We give ourselves up to 9 months for the thesis to evolve and price target to be reached, after which we expect the iPhone 10th anniversary model to reset demand in the fall of 2017. As we mentioned in our downgrade, with expectations for the June quarter low, and consensus at the midpoint of guidance, it was possible that shares rally. However, when we ask ourselves “Do we see Apple gaining or losing its next $100 billion of Company Data value”, the answer remains losing. The reason we picked $100 billion is to accommodate a rally such as today, and we still see that the dynamics of the next Price ($) 103.41 iPhone cycle is positioned to disappoint the market. The setup of stronger than 52-Week Range ($) 89.47-123.91 expected guidance for the September quarter driven by our opinion of an inventory build reverses the dynamic of the June quarter where expectations were low.

Gillis Technology Analyst / Director 646.346.7052 cell: 917.921.8616 BGC Financial L.P. Estimates and Valuation We adjust our FY2016 estimates to: $8.30 eps and $216B in net revenue from $8.21 eps and $212B in net revenue Our estimates represent YoY revenue decline of 8%. This compares to consensus revenue of $215B. Consensus EPS is $8.21. We adjust our FY2017 estimates to: $8.12 eps and $213B in net revenue from $8.24 eps and $209B in net revenue Our estimates represent YoY revenue decline of 1%. This compares to consensus revenue of $223B. Consensus EPS is $8.85. The company operates on a fiscal September year. Based on our $8.12 EPS estimate for FY2017 and using a 10x multiple, a discount to its peers, we determine a 12-month price target for AAPL of $85. Given the decline in revenue, and concern on future upgrade cycles, Apple trades at a discount to the broader market.

We recognize that Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated smartphones have only penetrated 42% of the global handset market, but we see the remaining market share not particularly suited for Apple’s product line up and pricing. IDC shows worldwide smartphone growth flat with shipment of 335 M units (+0.2% YoY) in Q1/16. See pages 12-13 for important disclosures and disclaimers 4 July 27, 2016 Colin W. Gillis Technology Analyst / Director 646.346.7052 cell: 917.921.8616 BGC Financial L.P. After reaching peak shipments in December 2015, even the iPhone has started showing decreasing growth rates. The fact remains that both the broader smartphone market and Apple iPhone unit growth have been consistently slowing over the last four quarters. We do not expect the next upgrade cycle for the iPhone to have the same impact as the iPhone 6 cycle that introduced larger screens due to the slowing market dynamics and our opinion that the value and desirability of Apple’s premium priced products is eroding.

We make the point that Apple has no other product with the volume demand and margin structure that could replace the income statement impact if iPhone sales grow at single digit levels or even decline. Share Repurchases and Declining Domestic Cash Apple has been draining its domestic cash via its extensive share repurchase program. The overseas cash now accounts for 90% of total cash. We also note that AAPL purchased $40B of stock in the period from January, 2015 till March, 2016 through share repurchase – which at current valuation is worth $35B eroding the company’s balance sheet of $5B See pages 12-13 for important disclosures and disclaimers 6 July 27, 2016 Colin W. Gillis Technology Analyst / Director 646.346.7052 cell: 917.921.8616 BGC Financial L.P. Other areas where we feel that AAPL can foray into includes: Advertising – Mobile advertising is expected to grow up to 80B over the next 3 years. Mobile Applications and Streaming Video – Apple has no application in the top 10 smartphone applications per comScore, compared to Google which has five.

Gillis Technology Analyst / Director 646.346.7052 cell: 917.921.8616 BGC Financial L.P. Risks Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment, tighter credit, negative financial news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance and operations of the company. Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile communication devices, personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating results could be affected badly in case it is not able to compete in such adverse market conditions. Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can lead to additional incurrence of inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s finances. Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs from single or limited sources. This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks. Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its products but also for its transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty. For additional risks, see the AAPL 10-K filing with the SEC.

HOLD (AAPL, $552.19) APPLE EARNINGS PREVIEW: DOWNGRADE TO HOLD AS SHARES HIT PRICE TARGET. PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART The risks seem balanced, to the upside and downside, with good news priced in. Shares of Apple have produced a total return (dividends reinvested) of 42.5% since our upgrade on April 22, 2013 compared to a total return of the S&P500 index of 16.4% (dividends reinvested). We are reducing our rating to HOLD from BUY as the stock has reached our $550 price target and we expect the performance of the stock to track more in line with the broader market index. What about the Record Holiday Quarter? We expect Apple to post an astounding quarter with over 80 million iOS units sold, powered by the view that the company makes the best products in the space. That said, we see that the market has already broadly anticipated a record quarter, and the upside risks seem balanced with downside risks in our view. Yes, we could be giving away some upside on the reaction to the December quarter print, particularly if the company can ship 57-60 million iPhones or produce results with revenue and Source: finance.yahoo.com EPS around $60 billion and $15. That said, we see that expectations are again possibly overheating, particularly with regard to the opportunity with China Mobile. Additionally the market dynamic where the functionality gap between products is closing, while the price gap is widening remains an issue for Apple. Broadly speaking, the next 1 billion people purchasing smartphones are going to be from demographics less wealthy than the first billion, and the skew towards lower priced hardware is likely to continue. We do not suggest that Apple, as a high-end brand, needs to chase after the low-end market, but we do suggest that the company introduce new products to its customer base. Wearables, Beacons, Payments, TVs. We remain positive on Apple’s ability to introduce wearable products that target the quantified self, a market we see as a natural fit to the Apple customer base. We are also positive on the potential for beacons and payments. We appreciate the concept of ultra-high definition TVs, and the streaming potential for associated content from iTunes, but caution this type of product may capture less than the 10% market share suggested by certain investors in a recent SEC filing. Laggard. It is also worth mentioning that one can argue that Apple is lagging in critical areas, with high profile wearable products from competitors already on the market such as Glass, inexpensive products such as Chromecast linking tablets/phones/PCs to TVs, and Apple’s approximately 575 million credit cards associated with iTunes an underutilized asset as it is not being broadly used for other payments. Valuation. While we appreciate that Apple’s shares may look appealing from a ratio perspective, trading at 12.3x our FY2014 earnings estimate, we mention again that Company Data earnings of companies in a fast moving technology landscape can change quickly. Apple remains that largest capitalized company on a U.S. listed exchange with its Price ($) 552.19 $493B valuation and as such we see the company as also being subject to selling for 52-Week Range ($) 385.10 - 575.14 reasons outside of its fundamentals such as cash liquidation needs.

We are estimating 53M iPhones (ASP $595), 25.3 million iPads ($425), 4.8M Macs (ASP $1300) and 10M iPods (ASP $165) sold in the December quarter to generate $57.2B in revenue and $14.05 in EPS with a gross margin assumption of 37.4%.

Our earnings estimate is $44.72 EPS, which compares to $39.75 in the prior year, growth of 12.5%. Consensus EPS is $43.85. The company operates on a fiscal September year. Based on our $44.72 EPS estimate for FY2013 and using a 12.3x multiple, a discount to its peers, we determine a 12- month price target for AAPL of $550.

Gillis Technology Analyst / Director 646.346.7052 cell: 917.921.8616 BGC Financial L.P. Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment, tighter credit, negative financial news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance and operations of the company. Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile communication devices, personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating results could be affected badly in case it is not able to compete in such adverse market conditions. Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can lead to additional incurrence of inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s finances. Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs from single or limited sources. This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks. Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its products but also for its transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty. For additional risks, see the AAPL 10-K filing with the SEC.

HOLD (AMZN, $308.04) AMAZON EARNINGS REVIEW: REVENUE GROWTH SERVED WITH MINISCULE PROFITS. PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Haiku: The stock is trading, as if investor patience, has come to an end. Amazon reported March quarter results in line with expectations, and provided a June quarter outlook with respectable revenue guidance but disappointing operating income. The stock has traded down 9% on the results, building on the recent downward trend that has Amazon’s stock approximately $100 below its all-time high on January 22, 2014. The quarter provided metrics that support both the positive and negative views on the company. On the positive side, the company reaccelerated revenue growth to 23% YoY, and issued June quarter guidance that could show revenue growth up to 26% YoY. Countering the top line growth are the following negatives: 1) The company remains in a constant investment cycle and forecast that June quarter operating income should result in a loss. 2) Shipping losses as a percent of revenue grew to 5%, and the company spent $2.15 on shipping cost for every dollar in shipping revenue. With a shipping loss of $980 million in the quarter, the recently announced prime price increase is only going to be small offset. We expect the company to push deeper into delivery logistics, and while this may allow same Source: finance.yahoo.com day delivery, it is likely to represent another major investment initiative. 3) Revenue per employee continues to drop, declining 10% YoY and 38% sequentially. 4) While revenue growth picked up, unit growth remained flat at 25%. 5) The “Technology & Content” expense line grew 44% YoY, materially faster than revenue. 6) Media growth of 8% YoY shows the disruption Amazon faces as content becomes digitized and shifts to subscription formats. International media growth is anemic at 4% YoY. The company now sells more digital media units than physical media units in North America. Amazon reported March quarter revenue of $19.7B in line with our estimate of $19.6B and consensus estimate of $19.4B, which accounted for 22.8% YoY growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.23 was in line with consensus of $0.23. Operating income was $146M in Q114. Guidance: The company’s June guidance for GAAP operating loss is a range from a loss of $455M to $55M. Revenue guidance is net sales between $18.1B and $19.8B (+15% to +26%). North America: North America segment reported revenue of $11.8B in the first quarter for 60% of total, 26.3% YoY growth and segment operating income of $562M. Segment operating margin was 4.7% down from 4.9% in the prior year. Media growth in North America was +12.4% YoY for 23.8% of North American revenue and EGM (electronics and other general merchandise) revenue grew 27.8% YoY to account for 66% of North American revenue. International: International segment reported revenue of $7.8B in the first quarter with 18% YoY growth. Media revenue grew 3.8% YoY to provide 33.5% of total, and EGM grew 27% YoY to provide 65.8% of total. Company Data Media & EGM: Worldwide Media revenue grew 8% YoY to $5.4B and 27.7% of total.

From $2.14 in GAAP EPS and $90.8B in net revenue. Our estimates compare to consensus of $1.94 in EPS and $89.8B in revenue.

Gillis Technology Analyst / Director 646.346.7052 cell: 917.921.8616 BGC Financial L.P. $4.30 in GAAP EPS and $107.9B in net revenue. From $4.88 in GAAP EPS and $107.1B in net revenue. Our estimates compare to consensus of $4.32 in EPS and $107.6B in revenue. Our FY15 estimates include revenue growth of 18% YoY, net income growth of 290.6% YoY and an operating margin of 2.8%. Based on our $1.11 EPS estimate for calendar 2014 and using a 329x multiple, we determine a 12-month price target for AMZN of $365. The company trades at an ultra-premium valuation. We expect more intense competition that maintains margins at a depressed level, a shift in the media business as other businesses capture digital delivery of media, increased Kindle competition, or weaker consumer spending is needed for AMZN to experience notable multiple contraction. Risks Competition: Amazon faces competition from various industries like retail, e-commerce services, digital and web services. These competitors have longer histories, greater resources and brand recognition and more customers, and are capable of adopting aggressive pricing, securing better terms from vendors and employing more resources for technology, fulfillment and marketing. Expansion: The company is witnessing significant expansion in its global operations which has increased the complexity of the business. This expansion also leads to strain on management, growth, financial, operational and other resources and also subjects the company to additional legal, financial and business risks. Fulfillment Centers: It is very important for the company to predict customer demand and optimize and operate its fulfillment centers successfully, otherwise it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity, increased costs and impairment charges. This could harm the business. Seasonality: The seasonal nature of the business puts a strain on the operations of the company. Net sales in the fourth quarter is disproportionate which leads to inventory, gross profits, net shipping costs and accounts payable being adversely affected. Foreign Exchange Risk: The company has significant foreign exchange risk associated with its international websites, which affects operating results. Further expansion in international operations increases exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. For additional risks, see the AMZN 10-K filing with the SEC.

HOLD (AAPL, $97.53) APPLE EARNINGS REVIEW: EXCITEMENT OVER 6% GROWTH PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Haiku: The second quarter, of declining iPad sales, is an adverse trend. Shares of Apple are trading up approximately 3% after June quarter earnings that accelerated the trends that materialized in the March quarter. iPhone unit sales slowed to +13%, compared to the broader market that is likely growing over 25% YoY. Revenue from iPhone unit sales grew at an even slower pace at 10% YoY, as customers opted for older models at lower prices. Average selling price declined $35 sequentially and $76 from the December quarter. ASPs of $561 are still materially above the expected industry average of $314 in 2014 according to IDC. While Apple is currently enjoying success selling its old model phones into emerging markets, one has to question the long term viability as competition becomes more aggressive in the mid and entry markets, offering consumers current model phones at similar or lower price points, and with a willingness to capture less gross margin. The mix shift to the older model Apple phones resulted in gross margins of 39.4%, above the company guidance of 37-38%, and 250 basis points above the prior year June quarter. We expect the favorable gross margin trends to reverse starting in the current quarter as the next generation iPhone should have a lower margin profile particularly if the phone has a sapphire screen. Source: finance.yahoo.com iPad. The company saw its second consecutive quarter of decline in iPad units sold on a YoY basis. Unit sales at 13.3 million were approximately half of the December quarter unit sales. While investors have largely glossed over the decline in iPad revenue, we mention it is a distinct possibility that Apple may experience declines in iPhone unit sales after the next upgrade cycle, if consumers lengthen the life span for smartphones as core features such as LTE, fingerprint scanning, and larger screens have the potential to satiate the typical customer. Our estimates for the coming upgrade cycle include some larger numbers such as 59.5 million phones in the December quarter, a number that may be hard to eclipse in the December 2015 quarterly results. Channel inventory. We estimate that iPhone channel inventory was kept near record levels at 15.25 million units, a small decline of 150k units from the March quarter. We also mention that while the company disclosed the change in channel inventory, it stopped providing the absolute number. For comparison, the company reduced channel inventory by 600K units in the prior year June quarter to 11 million units. The growth of channel inventory at 39% YoY meaningfully outpaces the unit sales volume of 10% YoY. Using 13 weeks in the quarter, and based on the 35.203 million units sold in the quarter (a pace of 2.7 million units per week), we note that 15.25 million units in the channel represents approximately 5.5 weeks on inventory. We find it interesting that the company is maintaining channel inventory at the high end of its 4-6 week range given a product refresh is likely coming. Apple reported June quarter revenue of $37.4B. Revenue grew 6% YoY. International sales accounted for 59% of total revenue. Apple returned over $8B to its shareholders in the June quarter. iPhone: The company sold 35.2M (+12.7% YoY) units in the Company Data June quarter. Macintosh: Apple sold 4.4M (+17.6% YoY) Macs during the quarter.

Data is based on fiscal year ending September. Risks Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment, tighter credit, negative financial news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance and operations of the company. Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile communication devices, personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating results could be affected badly in case it is not able to compete in such adverse market conditions. Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can lead to additional incurrence of inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s finances. Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs from single or limited sources. This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks. Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its products but also for its transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty. See page 9 for important disclosures and disclaimers 8 July 23, 2014 Colin W.

HOLD (AMZN, $601.18, $625 PT) AMAZON EARNINGS PREVIEW: LOOKING FOR THE CORE BUSINESS TO START TO DRIVE PROFITS PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Shares of Amazon are down over 10% year-to-date after delivering an eye popping return in 2015 of over 117%, driven in large part by the growth and profitability of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business. The company just started reporting the segment on a standalone basis in 2015. While the AWS business surprised with its profitability, we mention that the flip side is that the core retail business remains essentially unprofitable. This is expected to change when the company reports December quarter results on Thursday January 28th post market. With a market capitalization of $282 billion, our take is that the AWS business is priced in to stock. It is possible that risks to the margin of the AWS business may appear over time if services become commoditized. We see that the question of generating leverage from the core retail business is partially driven by controlling delivery costs, with net shipping costs estimated at 4.1% of net sales, and total shipping losses to exceed $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. We expect sustained investments in devices, content, and logistics may temper the leverage in the core business. We also note that Amazon shares are volatile on earnings, moving a minimum of Source: Nasdaq.com 6% over the last 7 quarters. We estimate revenue for the December quarter to be $36B, which is growth of 22% YoY. Our earnings per share estimate of $1.71 compares to an earnings per share $0.45 in the prior year and earnings of $0.17 in the prior quarter and is above the consensus estimate of $1.63. North America: We expect revenue from the North America segment to be at $21B in the quarter for 60% of total, +23% YoY growth and segment operating income of $896M. We expect Media to grow in North America at +14% YoY for 19% of North American revenue and EGM (electronics and other general merchandise) revenue to grow at 25% YoY, accounting for 80% of North American revenue. International: We expect revenue from International segment to be $12B in the quarter with a growth of 12% YoY growth. We expect Media revenue to grow 1% YoY to provide 29% of total, and EGM to grow at 17% YoY providing 70% of International revenue. AWS : We expect revenue from company’s Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business is expected to be $2.5B, for 7% of total revenue and growth of 81% YoY. Company Data Media & EGM: We expect worldwide Media revenue to grow 8% YoY to $7B for 21% of total Price ($) 601.18 revenue. Electronics and Other General Merchandise (EGM) revenue estimated at $25B, +22% 52-Week Range ($) 299.33-696.44 YoY growth. This segment is the growth engine for the company and expected to account for 71% of total revenue. Guidance: Guidance for GAAP operating income is a range from a loss of Mkt Cap ($B) 279.56 $80M to a profit of $1.28B. Revenue guidance is between $33.50B and $36.75B (+14% to +25% Price Target ($) 625 YoY Growth). Balance Sheet and Estimates. AMZN has $14B in cash ($30.18/share) and long- Shares Outstanding (M) 478 term debt of $8B as of September 30, 2015. Cash flow from operations was $2.6B during the quarter.

We maintain our HOLD rating on shares of Amazon Inc. Risks Competition: Amazon faces competition from various industries like retail, e-commerce services, digital and web services. These competitors have longer histories, greater resources and brand recognition and more customers, and are capable of adopting aggressive pricing, securing better terms from vendors and employing more resources for technology, fulfillment and marketing. Expansion: The company is witnessing significant expansion in its global operations which has increased the complexity of the business. This expansion also leads to strain on management, growth, financial, operational and other resources and also subjects the company to additional legal, financial and business risks. Fulfillment Centers: It is very important for the company to predict customer demand and optimize and operate its fulfillment centers successfully, otherwise it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity, increased costs and impairment charges. This could harm the business. Seasonality: The seasonal nature of the business puts a strain on the operations of the company. A net sale in the fourth quarter is disproportionate which leads to inventory, gross profits, net shipping costs and accounts payable being adversely affected. Foreign Exchange Risk: The company has significant foreign exchange risk associated with its international websites, which affects operating results. Further expansion in international operations increases exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. For additional risks, see the AMZN 10-K filing with the SEC.

HOLD (AMZN, $396.44) AMAZON EARNINGS PREVIEW: GASP- GROWTH AT A SPECTACULAR PRICE. PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Haiku: Less than one penny, for every dollar of sales, falls to net income. Amazon reports December quarter results on Thursday January 30 postmarket. We expect the company to post a revenue growth of 21.4% YoY, its slowest revenue growth in the last 12 quarters. We expect revenue growth in 2013 decelerates to 22.2% from 26.3% in 2012, and mildly declines again in 2014. While we are fan of stocks that produce growth and have a reasonable valuation (GARP), and we can also understand the valuations paid for hyper growth companies that are nascent and chasing large markets, we see that Amazon is exhibiting slowing growth – at a spectacular price valuation, a combination we coyly call GASP. Amazon has the 17th largest valuation of the S&P500 index at $176 billion, which we mention as we see the upside is becoming more limited. The company has the largest P/E ratio at 1,415x earnings for companies in the US with a market capitalization above 25 billion. The second company is Adobe at factor lower with a P/E of 100.4x. However, Amazon is ranked 18th in revenue growth using the same Source: finance.yahoo.com criteria of US listed companies with capitalization of $25 billion or more. We see that the price investors are paying is expensive for the current level of revenue growth given the uncertainty around the degree of leverage that the company may be able to achieve. That said, we also understand the view that Amazon is going to be the next Wal-Mart, the 8th largest company on a US listed exchange, and a company that is valued at a market cap 37% above Amazon. However it may take years for Amazon to grow into this valuation fully. We estimate revenue for the December quarter to be $25.8B, which is growth of 21.4% YoY. Our revenue estimate compares to consensus estimates of $26B. Our EPS of $0.54 compares to $0.21 in the prior year and -$0.09 in the prior quarter and is below consensus EPS of $0.67. Metric estimates. We estimate North America net sales of $15.5B (+27.2% YoY) in the December quarter, which form 60% of revenue. North America segment operating margin is estimated at 3.2%. We estimate International net sales of $10.3B (+13.6% YoY) in the December quarter, which form 40% of revenue. International segment operating margin is estimated at 0.5%. Media revenue is estimated at $7.6B (+16.8% YoY, 29.5% of revenue) and EGM at $16.6B (+19.8% YoY, 64.6% of revenue). The revenue per employee has been dropping for Amazon in the last few quarters. We estimate worldwide shipping revenue of $840M, worldwide net shipping costs of $1.18B (4.6% of worldwide net sales) in Q413. Guidance: The company’s forward guidance for GAAP operating income or loss in Q4 2013 is a Company Data range from a loss of $500M to an income of $500M. Revenue guidance from the company is net sales between $23.5B and $26.5B (+10% to +25%). Stock-based compensation and amortization Price ($) 396.44 of intangible assets is expected to be $350M. 245.75 - 408.06 52-Week Range ($) Shipping Losses: Worldwide shipping costs were 4.7% of net revenue compared to 4.6% in the Mkt Cap ($B) 180.54 previous quarter and 4.6% in the third quarter of 2012. Shipping losses continue to be an issue for 365 the company facing razor thin profitability, but it is a mild positive that losses have stabilized as Price Target ($) percent of total revenue in the last two quarters. Shares Outstanding (M) 457.0 Balance Sheet: Amazon has $7.6B in cash ($16.82 / share) and $3B long-term debt as of September 30, 2013. Cash flow from operations was $1.3B in the September quarter. We increase Avg. vol. (3mo) 2,742,740 our FY13 estimates and change our target to $365 from $320 but maintain our HOLD rating.

Cash flow from operations was $1.3B in the September quarter. Estimates and Valuation We increase our 2013 estimates to: $0.61 in GAAP EPS and $74.6B in net revenue. From $0.53 in GAAP EPS and $74.6B in net revenue. Our estimates compare to consensus of $0.77 in EPS and $73.7B in revenue. We decrease our 2014 estimates to: $2.40 in GAAP EPS and $91.1B in net revenue. From $2.82 in GAAP EPS and $91.1B in net revenue. See page 10 for important disclosures and disclaimers 8 January 30, 2014 Colin W. Gillis Technology Analyst / Director 646.346.7052 cell: 917.921.8616 BGC Financial L.P. Our estimates compare to consensus of $2.70 in EPS and $91.6B in revenue. Based on our $0.61 EPS estimate for calendar 2013 and using a 595x multiple, we determine a 12-month price target for AMZN of $365. Our previous target was $320. The company trades at an ultra-premium valuation, but we expect more intense competition that maintains margins at a depressed level, a shift in the media business as other businesses capture digital delivery of media, increased Kindle competition, or weaker consumer spending is needed before AMZN experiences notable multiple contraction. We do not suggest buying shares of Amazon but see no catalyst on the horizon that is likely to pull shares materially lower. Risks Competition: Amazon faces competition from various industries like retail, e-commerce services, digital and web services. These competitors have longer histories, greater resources and brand recognition and more customers, and are capable of adopting aggressive pricing, securing better terms from vendors and employing more resources for technology, fulfillment and marketing. Expansion: The company is witnessing significant expansion in its global operations which has increased the complexity of the business. This expansion also leads to strain on management, growth, financial, operational and other resources and also subjects the company to additional legal, financial and business risks. Fulfillment Centers: It is very important for the company to predict customer demand and optimize and operate its fulfillment centers successfully, otherwise it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity, increased costs and impairment charges. This could harm the business. Seasonality: The seasonal nature of the business puts a strain on the operations of the company. Net sales in the fourth quarter is disproportionate which leads to inventory, gross profits, net shipping costs and accounts payable being adversely affected. Foreign Exchange Risk: The company has significant foreign exchange risk associated with its international websites, which affects operating results. Further expansion in international operations increases exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. For additional risks, see the AMZN 10-K filing with the SEC.

(AMZN) INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS: BUY Stock Rating Amazon posted strong Q1 results with revenue and $1U,n9c0ha0n.g0e0d operating income upside. The revenue upside was driven primarily by Amazon's triple threat of Third-party Sellers (3P), Subscription Services, and AWS. We expect this Price Target trifecta to power Amazon's growth for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we expect Raised from $1,700.00 AWS, 3P and Advertising growth to buoy Amazon's operating income. Looking ahead, while profitability could experience some choppiness from quarter to quarter given Internet & Digital Media the timing of investments, we expect consistent revenue growth across Amazon's key business to continue to power its dominant position in both e-commerce and AWS. We Kerry Rice r■ eiterate BUY rating and raise our PT to $1,900. Amazon keeps growth momentum high in early 2018 with total revenue and profitability above consensus. Total revenue was $51.0B, above consensus of $49.9B, Jinjin Qian, CFA with upside coming from 3P, Subscriptions, AWS, and Other. GAAP operating income was $1.9B, significantly above consensus of $1.0B, driven primarily by ■ outperformance in N. America. Online Stores (aka 1P) revenue increased 13% y/y ex-FX to $29.9B. While solid growth, Online Stores revenue was modestly below consensus of $27.3B. Due to the adoption of a new accounting principle that shifted sales of apps and certain digital content to 3P from Online stores, which reduced growth and revenue. We expect consistent growth of Amazon's 1P business in the high-teens given its product ■ breadth and investment in its private-label brands. 3P is a powerful engine that should drive growth for the foreseeable future. 3P revenue increased 39% y/y ex-FX, reaching $9.3B in 1Q18. We estimate continued growth in 2Q18 of ~35% y/y. Given the net revenue recognition of 3P transaction, ■ we expect the strong growth to contribute significantly to operating income growth. Subscription Services increased 56% y/y, rising to $3.1B on strength of Prime Memberships. The company recently highlighted that it had +100M Prime members. We estimate Amazon has over +125M Prime Members with ~100M in the U.S. The impact of Prime is evidenced by the rapid growth in Subscription Services. Notably, Prime members typically spend 2x, shop more frequently, and stay engaged on the Price (USD) platform longer than non-Prime members. Amazon announced a price increase to $119 from $99, effective May 11th, which should serve as a revenue growth catalyst in 2H18. Notably, the company now recognizes Prime subscriptions equally over 12 months, which boosts revenue in the earlier quarters, instead of recognizing a larger portion of the deferred revenue in Q4.

Needham & Company, LLC April 27, 2018  AWS revenue growth accelerated by 5pt q/q (now two consecutive quarters of accelerating growth and margin expanded by 140bps y/y. Management highlighted that usage grew faster than revenue growth, implying an overall increase in spending. We believe the rapid pace of rolling out new services and features was a key driver for usage growth. We believe 1Q18 revenue growth was also helped by an easier comp due to price reduction in 4Q16. AWS segment margin expanded 140bps to 25.7%, contributing to $1.4B or 74% of total operating income.  Other revenue totaled $2.08B in Q1, which consisted primarily of advertising revenue. With the adoption of a new accounting standard, certain advertising services are now classified as revenue instead of reduction to cost of sales, leading to a positive impact of $560M to Other revenue line. Excluding this impact, other revenue would have been $1.5B, representing 61% y/y growth and 8.3% upside to our estimate of $1.4B. In addition to being a strong revenue driver, we believe advertising is also a meaningful contributor to the 90bps margin expansion of the North America segment. We expect the company to continue investing heavily in advertising, enabling sellers to reach consumers while at the same driving better a brand and product discovery experience for consumers.  Physical stores revenue, primarily from Whole Foods, totaled $4.3B during the quarter, modestly ahead of consensus of $4.1B. We believe the price reduction, Amazon lockers, and rollout of Prime benefits helped Whole Foods post upside. Amazon did not disclose y/y growth for this segment, but a 6% q/q decline was significantly better than historical seasonal trend, where WFM’s 1Q17 revenue declined 24% q/q from 4Q16.

While difficult to determine Price Target the impact of Amazon's Prime Day on revenue, industry analysts have estimated sales contribution of ~$400M in 2015 and ~$600M in 2016, a 50% y/y growth. We expect the growth rates to decelerate this year given the larger base, but believe sales could Internet & Digital Media reach $700-900M. We point to several highlights of this year's event that could propel Kerry Rice growth above our expectations, including extended hours, deeper discounts on Amazon devices, and discounts on subscription services, and geographic expansion.

This year, three new countries - China, India and Mexico - will join the one-day sales event, bringing the total to 13 ■ participating countries. Price (USD) More than boosting sales, we believe Prime Day continues to be strategic to Prime membership adoption. According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners' (CIRP's) latest estimate, Amazon now has 85MM Prime members in U.S. alone, representing growth of 30% y/y from 65MM last year. We expect Prime Day to continue driving hundreds of thousands of new members as in previous years. CIRP further highlights that Amazon Prime members on average spend $1300 annually vs. $700 by non-member customers. We believe Amazon finds Prime members more readily renew and are easier to retain. Finally, Prime members typically increase their spending over time. We also believe Amazon aims to drive higher publicity of its new product categories through Prime Day, such as Alexa-exclusive deals, Prime- Now exclusive deals, as well as 50% off its private label grocery products.

HOLD (AAPL, $97.67, $98 PT) APPLE EARNINGS PREVIEW: FOCUS ON SELLING PRICE, MARGINS, IPADS, AND EXPECTATIONS. PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Haiku: It is possible, the iPhone upgrade cycle, starts to lengthen out. Shares of Apple reached a lifetime high of $103.30 on September 2, 2014, and have since declined modestly by 5.3%, in line with the S&P500 index which shrank by 5.7% over the same period when factoring dividends. Looking at Apple’s share performance chart over the last two years, we mention that the other time that Apple has traded above the $100 mark was in September 2012. This raises the question, is the company poised to break out to new life time highs, or could shares be negatively impacted by overheated expectations and a slowing market for iPads? While we remain concerned on the iPhone’s shrinking market share, which was just 11.7% worldwide in the June quarter according to IDC (Android was 84.7%), we are positive on the burgeoning service layer that the company is growing. This includes Apple Pay, iBeacons, and improvements to iAds in iOS8 that allows for retargeting consumers. While we still see iAd as a faltering business, the potential when connected with iBeacons and Apple Pay is impressive. We would like to see the Source: finance.yahoo.com company build a robust subscription streaming music (Beats) and video offering to complement its other products. iPhone: We expect the company reverses the rather steep recent decline in average selling price given the product refresh and the addition of the premium priced iPhone 6+ to the product mix. We estimate 38.5M units sold at an ASP of $600 representing 56.7% of revenue. Unit volumes are growth of 13.9% YoY and 9.4% sequentially. While the iPhone is an impressive revenue and profit driver for the company, unit volume growth remains materially below the broader market which posted growth of 25.3% in the June quarter according to IDC. Our HOLD rating is driven in part by concern that the upgrade cycle for premium smartphones may elongate as the current iPhone provides the core needs for most users (fast connection speeds, biometric identification, larger screens). Faster and thinner may prove to be a less compelling reason to upgrade going forward. In our view, we are already seeing an elongation in the iPad refresh cycle. We expect the upgrade cycle for phones could also be stretched out by carrier reluctance to continue to subsidize handsets. We are currently modeling 59.5 million iPhones in the December quarter with an ASP of $655. This represents unit growth of 17% above the prior record for the company. Apple remains particularly vulnerable to posting record smashing results but having the outcome viewed as a disappointment due to overheated expectations. iWatch. We are adding in the Watch to our FY2015 estimates, with 18 million units at an ASP of $500. Given the watch is not available for sale, we expect this estimate could have a wide variance. Our estimate of revenue for September quarter at $40.8B is growth of 8.8% YoY and 8.9% sequentially. Our revenue estimate is above the consensus revenue of $39.8B. Our EPS estimate of $1.37 compares to $1.18 in the prior year and $1.28 in the prior Company Data quarter, and is above consensus earnings estimates of $1.30. iPad: We estimate 12.1M units sold at an ASP of $440 for 13.1% of total revenue. Price ($) 97.67 Unit volumes are decline of 14.1% YoY and decline of 8.9% sequentially. iPod: We 52-Week Range ($) 70.51 – 103.74 are modeling 2.7M units at an ASP of $160.Macintosh: We expect 4.7M units sold in Mkt Cap ($ B) 576.39 the quarter at as ASP of $1300 for 15% of revenue.

Stock Split Apple implemented its 7-for-1 stock split recently, to make the stock more accessible to a large number of investors and to reset the market’s expectations of where the stock should be trading. Capital Return Program 1) Apple expanded its capital return program to over $130B by the end of calendar 2015. 2) Share repurchase authorization increased to $90B from $60B. 3) Apple expects to use $1B per year to net-share-settle vesting restricted stock units. 4) Quarterly dividend increased by 8% ($3.29 per common share). Apple pays $11B annually in dividends. 5) Apple spent $66B (August 2012 to March 2014) as part of its capital return program.

Risks Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment, tighter credit, negative financial news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance and operations of the company. Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile communication devices, personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating results could be affected badly in case it is not able to compete in such adverse market conditions. Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can lead to additional incurrence of inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s See page 9 for important disclosures and disclaimers 9 October 20, 2014 Colin W.

Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs from single or limited sources. This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks. Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its products but also for its transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty. For additional risks, see the AAPL 10-K filing with the SEC.

A Rare Miss Stock Rating OVERWEIGHT Unchanged Industry View POSITIVE The Key Take-Away: AMZN reported revenue and OI that were 2% and 1% below Unchanged consensus and guided 3Q below. This kind of miss is a rare occurrence for a high Price Target USD 4130.00 quality name like AMZN, but forecasting the back side of the pandemic surge is proving lowered -4% from USD 4300.00 challenging for many companies, and despite the deceleration, AMZN continues to add prime members and gain e-commerce share. This print won’t derail the long-term bull Price (29-Jul-2021) USD 3599.92 case around AWS and retail, but likely means we are range bound for the next few Potential Upside/Downside +14.7% months until a catalyst emerges. Tickers AMZN Positives In 2Q: Advertising growth accelerated (Other +83% Y/Y) and is helping offset Market Cap (USD mn) 1815525 cost pressures elsewhere in retail. Similarly, AWS accelerated another 500bps and is Shares Outstanding (mn) 504.32 now up 900bps in the past two quarters, the highest Y/Y and Q/Q dollar growth ever, Free Float (%) 85.77 and gaining share on the rest of the industry.

The next two quarters look even Price Performance Exchange-Nasdaq 52 Week range USD 3773.08-2871.00 heavier given the prime day comp, but the company is seeing organic 2-yr CAGRs in the mid 20%’s, above pre-Covid levels. Costs appear to be inflating in areas outside of AMZN’s control (labor/fuel/etc.) into this deceleration, creating a nasty retail OI margin compression. AWS margins were down 270bps on salesforce and infrastructure investments. al n Estimate Changes & Valuation: We are reducing our estimates and our PT is now r te $4,130, based on the consistent SOTPs valuation framework using Amazon’s retail n I - (average of 30x EBITDA and 3x revenue) and AWS (8x revenue) on our FY22E numbers.

While Apple’s Equipment/IT Hardware leadership position in the premium smartphone market is well understood by investors, Samik Chatterjee, CFA AC we still see considerable upside to the stock from current levels led by a combination (1-212) 622 0798 of: 1) faster-than-expected transformation to a services business; 2) stronger-than- expected priceincreases in the core iPhone business; 3)underappreciated position for J.P.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC Bharat Daryani  Faster-than-expected transformation to Services. The mix of Services revenue (91-22) 6157 3057 rose from 8% in FY12 to 13% in FY17, and is forecast to furtherincrease to 20% by FY21E. We believe the transformation to services, led by growth in both installed J.P.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Investment Thesis Summary Transforming from a hardware company to a services company faster than investors had expected, which isdriving financial and valuation upside Apple hashistorically been regarded as an IT Hardware company tied to a short product refresh cycle of the iPhone in an extremely competitive smartphone industry. More recently, investors have been proved wrong on the pace of Apple’s transformation to a services company, with revenues in the Services reporting segment increasing from 8% of total in FY12to an estimated 20% of total in FY21E. The Services opportunity is currently derived primarily from App Store purchases and there are multiple emerging drivers, such asApple Music and Apple Pay, which should continue to drive strong growth. We forecast +23% revenue CAGR for Services (including comfortably hitting the FY20E Services revenuetargetof $48bn) with modestly better than company-wide margins to be accretive to profit growth, and accompanied by higher visibility to revenue and earnings, which we believe warrants a higher earnings multiple relative to the core hardware business. Apple Music and Apple Pay levered to megatrends of streaming music and digital currency, which areemerging growth areas for Services Apple Music and Apple Pay are key additions to the Apple ecosystem levered to consumer behavior megatrends in the form of the shift from downloading to streaming musicand the increasing adoptionof mobile payments. We expect Apple’s subscription-based Music service to reach >100mnMAUs by FY20E through increasing penetration of a target market estimated by J.P. Morgan Internet analyst, Doug Anmuth, to total 2.7bnusers,thusremaining the second largestmusic streamingservice globally after Spotify. We forecastannual revenuesto grow at a +41% CAGR to$16bnby FY21E. Separately, Apple Pay is gaining traction with the installed base and already leads competitive product offerings on Samsung or other Android platforms. We forecast ~$2.2bnin revenues from Apple Pay by FY21E with a +48% CAGR,led by the broader industry trend of strong growth in use of mobile payments and increase in NFC-enabled merchants. Apple to expand mediaoffering to consumers with the additionof video, newspaper, and magazine content We expect Appleto expand its media offering beyond music by adding videoand print media content, resulting inan all-encompassing Media subscription. We expect Apple to ramp up its investments in video content steadily starting with ~$1bnin 2018. We expect a steady increase in investments in video content, given Apple’s focus on differentiation through content rather than encouragement ofcord-cutting. However, the level of investments is unlikely to reach Netflix’s $8bnand Amazon’s $5bnover our forecast window (FY21E). We expect Apple to combine the video and print media offering (through acquisition of Texture) to offer a packaged subscription at $14.99/month relative to $9.99 for Apple Music anddrive Apple Music subscribers to upgrade to the packaged subscription, while at the same time growing the subscriber base at a rapid pace. We estimate Apple’s incremental media offerings beyond Music to drive an incremental $2.8bnof revenues by 2025. Missing the forest for the trees: Concerns about iPhone volumes have driven investors to overlook the robust growth in the installed base In addition to the increase in service revenue opportunityper device, growth in the installed base of Apple devices is the other primary contributor to thegrowth in new This document is being provided for the exclusive use of OSKAR ROESKE at HOCHSCHULE FUER TECH 3 & WIRT BERLIN. Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Services revenue. While investors have been concerned about the modest growth in iPhone volumes, Apple has still been able to drive double-digit increases in the installed base through a combination of 1) new subscribers; 2) incremental consumer switching to iOS; and 3) replacement units from existing iOS users making it to the secondary market (we estimate Apple has a 50% share of the secondary market relative to 15% of new smartphone market). We estimate atotal installed base of 1.4bndevices in 2017 (~1bniPhones) rising to 1.9bnby 2021or a +7% CAGR. Pricing power, driven in part by differentiation on technology, will continue to surprise investors on the upside Investors have been pleasantly surprised by the limited price elasticity exhibited by customers, which includes the increase in iPhone volumes despite a +3% pricing CAGR over the last tenyears (and a higher increase in retail price in certain countries due to roll-off of carrier subsidies). Consumers have been willing to pay higher ASPs, due to a combination of: 1) stickiness of the iOS platform (including smartphonesand accessories like watches) through technology differentiation; 2) increasing use of financing to pay in installments;and3) push-out of spend on laptops and tablets. Our analysis reveals that Apple has an exceptional track record of success with the top-of-the-line smartphone marketed each year and with larger screen size smartphones (generally priced at a premium), relative toApple’sprimary competitor in the high-end smartphone category, Samsung. The latest generation of iPhones launched on September 12, with base prices ranging from $1,099 at the high-end to $749 at the low-end,is set to continue to drive ASPshigher. Apple to drive differentiation of the ecosystem through technology leadership Apple’s portfolio strategy of focusing on design of three iPhone models each year allows it more bandwidth for resources to drive technology leadership and quality assurance, which are crucial in maintaining price premium over competitive products and driving a longer life-cycle of the product (which supports installed base growth). Apple is already comfortably ahead of competition in relation tofacial recognition modules. JPM Asia Technology analyst, Narci Chang, expects world facing 3D Sensing to be adopted on iPhones starting in 2019 (see report), again comfortably ahead of competition. Similarly, optimism around foldable smartphones has increased in recent months; we expect Apple to be a fast follower with adoption starting in 2021 (see report) if it finds theform factor gaining traction with customers. Apple’s technology leadership drives both new customers joining the iOS installed base (an estimatedone-third of annual demand) and replacement demand led by upgrades from existing customers (roughly two-thirds). Acceleration in revenue growth to be a catalyst for investor sentiment; buybacks to boost earnings growth further We expect a +10% revenue CAGR between FY17 and FY21, accelerating from the +8% CAGR over the last fiveyears, led by a combination of high-single-digit revenue growth in iPhones and double-digit revenue growth in Services and “Other Products” revenues. The acceleration in revenue growth should drive investor attention to the change in the drivers of revenue growth from being primarily led by iPhone revenues historically, to a balance between iPhone, Services, and Other Product revenues over our forecast window. We expect the +10% revenue CAGR to translate into a +17% earnings CAGR over the forecast window (FY21E), through deployment of capital in share buybacks on a continual basis. This document is being provided for the exclusive use of OSKAR ROESKE at HOCHSCHULE FUER TECH 4 & WIRT BERLIN. Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Enormous capital deployment opportunity provides optionality The firm’s target of being net cash neutral in the long-run relative to the net cash position of $129bnat end of F3Q18 and strong free cash flow generated annually (average of $54bnannually over last fiveyears) provides an enormous opportunity for capital deployment. However, we believe medium-term upside to our base case estimates (based on buybacks largely in line with free cash flow) is likely from large buybacks or acquisitions. For example, we estimate annual buybacks of $100bncan help Apple can reach close to a cash neutral position by FY21E, with accretion of ~$2.25 to our FY21E EPS. On the downside, however, our base case forecasts embed largelyflat operating margins, and we estimate the proposed tariffs,if implemented,could be a modest headwind of 50bpson operating margins medium- term and moderate our earnings growth forecasts. Expect M&A to focus on Services opportunities and large installed base; Video Gaming, Automotive,and Smart Speakers could be potential opportunities While Apple has historically acquired hardware companies, it has largely been to bring certain technologies in-house and have the ability to further develop them. We expect bolt-on acquisitions of hardware companies to continue as the firm continues to evaluate technology differentiation for future generation of products. However, recent acquisitions of Texture, and Shazam, are more typical of acquisitions we would expect Apple to focus on moving forward to further enhance the Services offering to its existing installed base. Additionally, we do not rule out Apple looking at other end-markets with a combination of a large installed base and associated opportunity to deploy services. We believemobile video gaming and the automotive end-market could be of interest in this regard, in addition to potential interest in the smart speaker end-market given lackluster performance of the HomePod todate. Stronger track record of profitability than other technology leaders; yet trading at only market multiples makes it attractive to both value and growth investors Interestingly, with annual revenues of $230bn, Apple is ahead of other technology leaders, including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Netflix (all covered by JPM Internet analyst Doug Anmuth). In greater contrast, Apple’s $61bnin operating profit compares to $26bnfor Alphabet, $20bnfor Facebook, $4bnforAmazon, and $0.8bn for Netflix. Additionally, the firm has a historical track record of much stronger earnings growth than the S&P 500 index,of which it is the largest constituent at ~5% weight. However, AAPL shares still trade at 16.6x NTM P/E, modestly below the market multiple and well below trading multiples of other technology leaders. We expect the combination of double-digit earnings growth and a trading multiple in line with the market to screen very attractively for both value and growth investors (although AAPL ispart of only the S&P 500 growth index). We rate Apple shares Overweight with solid +23% upside potential to our December 2019 price targetof $272 We rate AAPL shares Overweight given our favorable outlook on iPhone and Services revenues relative to investor expectations, catalysts toaccelerate revenue growth, and upside risk to our base forecast for +18% earnings CAGR. We expect increasing appreciation of acceleration in growth, along with greater visibility into earnings and cash flow with increasing mix of Services,to drive a modest re-rating, from NTM trading multiple of 16.6x to a 17.5x blended P/E, which we arrive at a based on a SOTP methodology using 14.0x P/E for iPhones, 11.0x for Mac and iPad devices, 26.0xfor Services, 25.0x for Apple Watch, and 16.0x for Other Products. We see +23% upside to our December 2019 price targetof $272. This document is being provided for the exclusive use of OSKAR ROESKE at HOCHSCHULE FUER TECH 5 & WIRT BERLIN. Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Risks to Rating and Price Target Industry Downside Risks Deceleration or contraction in the handset and smartphone market could be faster than expected Economic conditions or shifting consumer demand could cause greater-than- expected deceleration or contraction in the handset and smartphone markets. This would negatively impact Apple’s prospects for growth, and the shares may fail to achieveour target price as a result. Increase in competitive pressures in international markets Apple is increasingly participating in internationalmarkets, such as China and India, where local players, which are better situated, could leverage their position and pull on levers such as pricing to make the market more competitive. In addition,tariffs enactedby local governments may further hurt Apple’s ability to effectively compete in international markets. Company-Specific Downside Risks Investment in new business strategies and acquisitionscould be fruitless Apple has historically invested in new business strategies and acquisitions. As such, success on these investments has low visibility at this time and could lead to greater- than-expected liabilities andexpense. Additionally, new investments could have a negative impact on current operations by distracting management. Key man risk around departure of chief executive officer While risks related to departure of management executives is considerably lower relative to in the past, we believe the execution on strategic priorities under CEO Tim Cook’s leadership does still present modest risk to the share price, although we see a strong group of executives to support business performance without disruptions. Litigation with Qualcomm could drive unexpected liabilities As part of risk mitigation from the ongoing litigation with Qualcomm, Apple has provisioned what management believes could be worst-case payments to Qualcomm in the event of an adverse judgement. However, less favorable outcomes with greater damages awarded to Qualcomm could be a liability for Apple beyond the provisions, and drive downside to our price target.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Key Themes for AAPL Stock Transformation to Services Faster than Expected Forecast Services to grow to one-fifth of revenues by FY21E Investors have been pleasantly surprised on the pace of transformation to Services, particularly given the size of the hardware business with ~215mnsmartphone units sold annually. However, with strong double-digit growth (+18%) CAGR over the last five years, Apple has more than doubled the FY12 revenue of $13bnby FY17 ($30bn). We forecast a modestly stronger +23% CAGR through FY21E, including comfortably achieving its target of doubling the FY16 revenue of $24bnby FY20E (JPMe $56bn). Growth will be drivenboth by increase in the installed base from 1.4bndevices in FY17 to 1.9bnby FY21E at a +7% CAGR, and an increase in service revenue per installed device at a 16% CAGR.

Apple Music to account for $30bnby 2025, led by strong subscriber growth Apple’s Music service, based on monthly subscriptions, is second only to Spotify globally and we see adequate room for growth for both players in a market where consumers are switching to streaming services relative to download purchases. Streaming revenues for the industry have grown at a +59% CAGR since 2012 and we expect the same to continue withApple Music gaining further penetration of the estimated (by J.P. Morgan Internet analyst, Doug Anmuth) TAM globally of 2.7bn users relative to its current subscriber base of >50mn. We expect Apple to reach 106mnsubscribers by FY20 and 262mnby FY25, accounting for an estimated $30bn of revenues by FY25.

Morgan estimates. Media services, including original video, to be the next big driver for Apple News reports (see link) indicate that Apple is looking to invest around $1bninto original video programming initially to drive exclusive content and we expect investments to steadily ramp further over time. However, investments willremain lower than Netflix’s $8bnand Amazon’s $5bnlevels through our forecast window (FY21E),primarily as Apple is looking to add exclusive content to the media platform rather than position itself as an alternative to cable,Netflix or Amazon Prime. Additionally, we expect Apple to add print media subscriptions, building on the recent acquisition of Texture to further enhance the services offering. We believe Appleis likely to look to consolidate the media services by tying together existing Music services and original video and print media. We expect the Apple Media subscription to be priced at a premium to the existing Music subscription; we assume pricing of $14.99 for individual subscriptions (vs. $9.99 for Music) and $19.99 for family subscriptions (vs. $14.99 for Music). We also expect 35% of Apple Music subscribers to upgrade to the all-encompassing Media service by FY25E, and account for an incremental $3bnof revenue in FY25E.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Apple Pay leveraged to growth in mobile payments globally We see Apple Pay as a key component in the Services portfolio which is positioned for significant growth in the coming years with the increasing adoption of mobile payments globally. eMarketer forecasts global mobile payment users amounted to 721mnin 2017and are expected to expand at a+13% CAGR to greater than 1bn globally in 2020. In consumer surveys, Apple Pay has had stand-out feedback with materially better adoption withininstalled base of devices relative to other competing platforms on Android devices, including those of primary premium smartphone competitor, Samsung. We expect Apple Pay revenues to rise at a +38% CAGR through FY25 to $6bn.

Growth in Installed Base Underappreciated Investors have been concerned relative to modest volume growth in iPhone in the backdrop of plateauing smartphone volumes iPhone volumes rose quickly from 11mnunits in the first year after the first iPhone launch (FY08) to peak at 231mnunits in FY15, before moderating to FY17 volumes of 217mn. The combination of Apple’s current three-fourths market share in the premium smartphone market and expectations for flat volumes for the handset and smartphone market have raised concerns relative to maturity of the smartphone market and Apple’s position in it, leading to limited opportunities for volume growth. We acknowledge the modest volume opportunity for iPhones, particularly when every generationof smartphones is accompanied by price increases, and forecast +1% volume CAGR through FY21E.

Morgan estimates. However, we believe investors are missing the forest for the trees: Installed base demonstrating robust growth feeding into strong Services growth While investors have been focused on iPhone volumes sold annually in the primary market, the driver fueling the transformation to Services has been the expansion in the installed base which has demonstrated double-digit growth to date. Going forward, growth in the installed base is likely to moderate to a high-single-digit pace, but still implying growth of roughly 100mnunits in the installed base of devices every year relative to flat volumes in the primary market. The high-single-digit expansion in the installed base is led by new consumers switching to the iOS platform, new subscribers, and a high portion of replacement units makingtheir way to the secondary market where we estimate iPhones have a 50% market share relative to ~15%market share of the new smartphone market.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Limited Consumer Price Elasticity Will Continue to Surprise Apple has continued to drive higher prices to grow revenues despite benign growth in iPhone volumes; see acceleration in pricing over the forecast window Blended ASPs for iPhones have increased at a +3% CAGR since 2007 with an even higher increase in retail prices in certain geographies where carrier subsidies rolled off after 2010. Despite the increase in prices, iPhone volumes have not shown any significant signs of decline and investors have been pleasantly surprised by the limited price elasticity exhibited by consumers. Banking on the limited price elasticity demonstrated by consumers, Apple pivotedto a more aggressive pricing strategy with the launch of the iPhone Xat a base price of $999 in 2017,which has put the firm on track for a high-teen percentage increase in pricing for FY18E.The latest generation of iPhones released on September 12 this year now has the top-end product with a base price $1,099 and the low-end product with a base price of $749, setting up the firm for another year of strong price increase, by our estimates. Figure 7: Apple iPhone Blended ASP Forecast $ per Unit $900 $862 $887 $836 $850 $800 $770 $750 $700 $671 $645 $652 $650 $629 $607 $603 $600 $550 $500 Source: Company reports and J.P. Morgan estimates. Better track record of driving the premium pricing strategy relative to peers Our analysis shows Apple has a better track record relative to competition with driving consumer adoption of the top-end phone in its portfolio.For example,iPhone X has accounted for one-third of total iPhone shipments to date and Apple’stop-end iPhones accounted for 14%-38% of total shipments over the last sixquarters, which compared to a range of 3%-24% for Samsung. Similarly, Apple has a solid track record with larger screen size phones (marketed popularly as Plus Size models) with shipments of these premium models accounting for an increasing portion of total shipments, roughly in line with Samsung’s track record with a much broader set of smartphone models offered in larger screen sizes. Pricing strategy is sustainable as consumers are willing to pay more for smartphones,which are dis-intermediating other IT hardware spend We believe the pricing strategy is sustainable and expect limited price elasticity from consumers led by: 1) stickiness of the iOS platform with the combination of the iPhone and accessories,including watches; 2) smartphone capabilities increasing and substituting demand for laptops and tablets, pushing out the replacement cycle led consumer spending on these devices; 3) consumers spending an increasing amount of time on a smartphone; and 4) consumers increasingly using financing to convert the high retail prices into affordable monthly payments. 11 21YF 31YF 41YF 51YF 61YF 71YF E81YF E91YF E02YF E12YF This document is being provided for the exclusive use of OSKAR ROESKE at HOCHSCHULE FUER TECH & WIRT BERLIN.

Capital Deployment Provides Option Value to Investors Target of neutral net cash position long-term provides optionality to investors Apple ended F3Q18 with $244bnof cash on the balance sheet and with debt of $115bn, leading to a net cash position of $129bn. Additionally, the firm has generated on average free cash flow of $54bnover the last fiveyears. Apple has not put a timeline to its net cash neutral target, but the availability ofupto $291bnor ~30% of the market cap to deploy over FY19E-21E through a combination of dividends, share repurchases, and M&A provides enormous option value to investors in terms of upside to earnings. Embed increasedshare repurchases and dividend in our base case forecasts, partly drivingour above consensus forecast for FY20 and FY21 Apple has returned roughly $300bnof cash to shareholders since 2012 through the end of F3Q18,which is roughly 30% of its current market capital, and we expect there is another roughly $300bnto deploy over the next threeyears. While we don’t expect Apple to reach its net cash neutral position by end of FY21E, we expect share buybacks to accelerate to a $75bnannual pace (similar to 2018E) rather than the slower pace of around $30-$35bnduring FY15-17—in part driving our above consensus forecast for FY20E and FY21E. Additionally, we are modeling a steady increase in dividends from $2.40/share in FY17 to $3.42/share in FY21E, amounting to $42bnof dividends over the next three years.

Morgan estimates. Acceleration in share repurchases to drive 6% accretion to our already above consensus FY20 and FY21 earnings estimates Despite our above consensus modeled pace of buybacks in FY20 and FY21, we still expect Apple to have a net cash position of $60bnby end of FY21E (and generating over $64bnof free cash annually). We see upside to our already above consensus forecasts if management decides to aggressively pursue their target foraneutral cash position. We estimate a pace of buybacks close to $100bnannually would drive the company to a cashneutral position by end of FY21E, and imply upside of $2.25 to our already above consensus FY21E EPS forecast. Balance between share purchase acceleration and M&A is likely as Apple invests to build the Services platform and maintain leadership in technology We believe it is more realistic to assume a balance between an acceleration of share repurchases beyond what is already in our base case estimates and spend on acquisitions as the drivers of earnings upside relative to our estimates. M&A Opportunities: Focus on Services with Large Installed Base Apple has historically only engaged in bolt-on acquisitions;expect focus to be on subscription-based service opportunities in the coming years Apple has a history of making multiple bolt-on acquisitions everyyear, whichhas largelybeen focused on bringing any hardware technologythatthe company expects to be crucial in driving competitive differentiationin-house and better managingits development towards commercialization. As shown in Table 1, a lot of applications in use on iPhones today can be associated with technology acquisitions in the past, for example,facial recognition using 3D sensing and speech recognition for Siri. However, as we look at the transformation of the business to Services at a rapid pace, we expect a greater bias towards acquiring subscription-based software businesses that can be integrated into the Services segment, and we believe the recent acquisitions of Shazam and Texture are typical examples of what investors should expect going forward. 13 2$ 32$ 11$ 54$ 11$ 53$ 21$ 03$ 21$ 33$ 31$ 47$ 41$ 07$ 41$ 57$ 41$ 57$ 41$ $80 $70 $60 $50 $40 $30 $20 $10 $0 21YF 31YF 41YF 51YF 61YF 71YF 81YF 91YF 02YF 12YF Share Repurchases Dividends This document is being provided for the exclusive use of OSKAR ROESKE at HOCHSCHULE FUER TECH & WIRT BERLIN.

Morgan estimates. Relative to transformational M&A driving access to new end-markets, we expect criteria to include large installed base and services opportunity We believe with increasing focus on Services revenues, particularly in the form of subscriptions, Apple’s interest in entering new end-markets is likely to be evaluated based on the opportunity for Apple to offer services (leveraging the iOS platform) on a large installed base. Certain end-markets in our view couldbe of interest based on this criterion: 1. Video gaming companies: The video gaming industry generates about $125bnin revenues, including roughly one-third on smartphones, making it an attractive industry for smartphone manufacturers in terms of vertical integration, particularly given recent investments in augmented reality.Apple’s focus on services will be highly complemented by video games, which are taking time and monetization share from other forms of entertainment. JPM Media analyst, Alexia Quadrani, believes the increasing global reach, improving technology, shift to higher-margin digital revenues, and increasingly social environments are fueling greater player engagement and spending. Software game sales are becoming increasingly digital (in the US 31% of total sales in 2010 to 74% in 2016) which is likely to coincide with the increasing computing capabilities and larger screen sizes on smartphones to drive consumer gaming habits increasingly to mobile devices. We see opportunity for smartphone-basedgaming to increase from current levels of one-third of gaming revenues to around 40% of the industry by 2020, led by a double-digit annual growth rate. 2. Automotive services: Numerous press reports have in the past indicated Apple’s interest in the automotive end-market, including developing an autonomous vehicle. We think Apple’s interest in the automotive end-market is reasonable given the large installed base (roughly 1.4bnvehicles globally) and the ability to deliver services to drivers and passengers. We see the automotive OEM business This document is being provided for the exclusive use of OSKAR ROESKE at HOCHSCHULE FUER TECH 14 & WIRT BERLIN. Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 as a largely unattractive one both in terms of manufacturing and supply chain complexity, and profitability. Though,we would not rule out acquisitions of: a. Infotainment companiesproviding Apple ability to deliver content in the automotive end-market. Apple has already developed the CarPlay software to get access to the automotive end-market, but we believe owning the complete infotainment product would allow Apple to deliver the same high-quality experience that it hasbeen able to offer consumers on other devices like the iPhone. b. Small-scale automotive OEMsto provide Apple experience in integration of software-based services with the hardware. 3. Smart Speakers: We acknowledge that Apple already has a HomePod product, which was first released in early 2018. Based on our discussion with the company, we believe Apple wants to position the HomePod as a high-quality speaker with some intelligence features, relative to: 1) Google Assistant, which is geared to intelligence leveraging the company’s leadership in search functions; and 2) Amazon Alexa, which is geared towards promoting Amazon’s portfolio of features, including driving purchases in the Amazon marketplace. We believe this leaves room for Apple to position another product with greater intelligence features and with a different form factor, potentially leveraging an acquisition similar to its purchase of Beats to enter the headphone category.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Apple’s Opportunity in Health & Fitness Apple has already disrupted the fitness-wearables market Apple’s launch of AppleWatch was relatively late when compared to early movers in the fitness-driven wearables market,including Garmin, Fitbit and Nike. However, despite being late to the market, Apple Watch managed to disrupt some of the existing players, particularly single-activity tracking devices, as wellasexpand the addressable market for the wearables market. While most early entrants into the wearables market were seen as functional products targeting the fitness enthusiast, we believe Apple managed to expand the addressable market with a utility product, which went beyond the niche segment of fitness enthusiasts. Now set to addresshealth-wearablesmarket, further expanding the target demographic to drive higherpenetration We believe with the launch of features like heart rate monitoring and electro cardio grams (ECGs) inthe latest generation of Apple Watches (Series 4), Apple is now making a bigger push into health-based wearables, expanding the target market beyond the typical age demographic interested in fitness wearables. For example,the target age demographicin the USnow includes an additional 136mnpeople in the age group of 50 years and above, relative to the existing target market of 182mnin the age group below 50 years for fitness-based wearables. Move into preventive healthcare to provideawider TAM than diagnostics We believe the preventive healthcare market is an even more attractive market than diagnostics.With its entry into health-based wearables Apple is able to target a much wider population relative to the targeted individuals in the diagnostic phase following symptom identification. For example, relative to the occurrence of AFib (Atrial Fibrilation),which the Series 4 watch can help identify, the number of people impacted in the US rangesfrom 2.7mnto 6.1mnand the company will be involved in the diagnostic phase with products from specialized companies like iRythm (covered by JPM Medical Supplies & Devices analyst Robbie Marcus).This compares to 182mnTAM for those aged50 or more who are likely to adopt the Apple Watch for preventive measures and symptom identification for AFib. Multiple Re-rating from Services Transformation and Visibility into Replacement Demand Revenue acceleration likely to be a catalyst to increase investor focuson Services transformation We believe investors have largely ignored the transformation of the business towards Services. However, looking forward, we see a catalyst in the acceleration in revenue growth to a forecasted +10% CAGR from the +8% CAGR in the last five years, with further likely upside to our estimates from: 1) stronger increase in Services revenue per device; 2) stronger than expected pricing on iPhones; 3) and stronger than currently modeled growth in the Apple Watch after a major refresh with the Series 4. Boosted by an aggressive capital deployment program with repurchases totaling a forecasted $294bnfor FY18E-FY21E, we expect a +17% earnings CAGR leading to our above consensus EPS forecasts.

Premium to recent year average multiple warranted on return to innovation We believe the recent year discount on Apple’s trading multiple relative to the S&P 500 multiple has largely been driven by the perception that opportunities for innovative product launches into new markets have moderated since the large success of the iPhone. However, we believe Apple has now returned to demonstrating its innovation prowess, although now disrupting end-markets like wearables, health, and gaming, rather than disrupting existing hardware like it did with iPhones. In our view, the return to innovation warrants a re-rating relative to recent year average P/E multiple of 13.5x. We believe a modest re-rating is warranted based on our SOTP analysis Wearrive at a blended multiple of 17.8x for the combination of Apple’s products and services we anticipate in our forecast and expect a modest re-rating from current NTM trading multiple of 16.6x, led by a 14.0x multiple on the iPhone (in line with Nokia’s multiple during its leadership in feature phones)and 26.0x on Services (in line with hardline and luxury goods retailers with similar loyalty-driven recurring purchases from customers).

It appears there has been an increasing narrative that AAPL should be evaluated in comparison to earnings multiples for consumer staples companies, such as Household and PersonalCare products with high degree of repeat purchases by consumers. We acknowledge the repeat purchase cycle for consumers in relation to the iPhone and Services group, which together currently account for 77% of total company revenues; however,the iPad, Mac, and Other products have more unpredictable replacement cycles. In addition, while the average 21x P/E multiple for Household and Personal Care (HPC) companies can be thought of as the high-end of potential re-ratingfor AAPL shares, we think investors should consider a discount to the average HPC multiple to account for the ability of consumers to push out smartphone purchases during a downturn in addition to trading down to less expensive variants, with only the latter likely for HPC products.

Favorable Position Relative to Other Technology Leaders Comparison with other technology leaders is normaland we find Apple well positioned relative to balance of valuation multiple against earnings outlook Interestingly, with annual revenues of $230bn, Apple is ahead of other technology leaders, including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Netflix (all covered by JPM Internet analyst Doug Anmuth). In greater contrast, Apple’s $61bnin operating profit compares to $26bnfor Alphabet, $20bnfor Facebook, $4bnforAmazon, and $0.8bn for Netflix, showcasing a much stronger track record of generating profits than other technology leaders.While revenue and earnings growth rates for AAPL are expected to be a little less than half of the group average of Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix, so is the earnings multiple of 16.0x relative to the group average of 42.2x. As a result,we find AAPL shares screening well forboth growth and value investors relative to techleaders when looking at earnings multiple for every point of earnings growth, with PEG ratio (ex-cash) of 0.8x relative to the group average of 1.0x.

Tariff Headwinds Could Moderate Earnings Growth Expectations Currently proposed tariffsonly impact accessories Apple recently sent a letter to the US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, detailing a list of products that will be impacted from the currently proposed $200bn of tariffs on imports from China. The list initially included products from the “Other Products” segment, which has total revenues of an estimated $26bn in FY19E, but was later updated to exclude Apple Watch which we estimate accountsfor almost half of the segment revenues. We estimate Other Products excluding Apple Watch has gross margins closer to 20%. iPhones are also currently outside the purview of the proposed tariffs. We see limited impact as Apple is likely to take pricing to offset the pressures We believe it is relatively easier for Apple to raise prices on accessories relative to taking price increases on the iPhone. We expect relatively minimal price elasticity for accessory products and expect Apple to likely raise prices to cover entirely the tariffs. As shown in Table 7below, we expect the 25% tariff to translate into a price increase of 15% if Apple decides to pass the entire impact of the tariff to consumers.

Headwind of up to 50bps in the worst case if Apple decides not to raise prices As shown in Scenario 3in the table above, we estimate a headwind of up to 50 bps to total company margins if Apple decides to take a conservative approach to prices and absorb the impact, which in our view is unlikely given the even lower degree of price elasticity on accessories. No tariff impact on iPhone currently; however, we would not expect a change in sourcing strategy even with a 25% tariff Although the iPhone is not the purview of currently proposed tariffs, the greater risk to Apple would be from any potential developments relative to tariffs on the iPhone, which accounts for 60% of total company revenues. However, our analysis shows that even if a 25% tariff were to be imposed, it would still make economic sense for Apple to continue with the current manufacturing footprint relative to moving the assembly to the United States. Over the long-run, we would expect Apple to move assembly operations for the iPhone (done by Pegatron, Honhai, and Wistron) to other countries with relatively cheaper labor cost relative to the United States and not This document is being provided for the exclusive use of OSKAR ROESKE at HOCHSCHULE FUER TECH 21 & WIRT BERLIN.

See labor cost still driving enough arbitrage to keep existing manufacturing footprint rather than move to the United States As shown inTable 8, we estimate moving the assembly operations to the United States for the iPhone X would increase the cost to Apple from ~$522 to ~$643 (assuming only 50% of components are manufactured in China), relative to an estimated cost of $653 if Apple decided to pay a 25% tariff on the assembled product. In our view, the lack of any major advantage of moving assembly operations back to the United States limits the likelihood of any investment in the US as a consequence of the tariffs.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Financial Outlook Revenue Outlook: Low-Double-Digit Growth Led by iPhone, and Services Innovation has enabled the company to drive a +8% revenue CAGR over the last five years Apple’s innovation in new and existing product categories, including smartphones, tablets, and watches has helped drive robust revenue growth for the firm over the last few years. Looking over the last five years, the firm has posted revenue CAGR of +8% between FY12 and FY17, although as shown in Figure 15, FY17 revenues are largely in line with FY15 revenues following a levelling out of the growth driver in the form of iPhone revenues. As shown in Figure 16, relative to the revenue growth of $73bnfrom FY12to FY17 for the firm, three-fourths has been driven by iPhones, and 20% by Services, with Mac and Other Products contributing a minority, while iPad has been a modest headwind.

We expect low-double-digit revenue growth, led by iPhone, Services, and Apple Watch As shown in Table 13, we believe the medium-term revenue growth for the company will track in the low-double-digit range, led by a combination of: 1) high-single-digit revenue growth in iPhones, largely driven through price/ASP increases; 2) double- digit revenue growth in Services, led by growth in both the installed base as well as revenueper unit from the installed base; and 3) double-digit revenue growth in Other Products, the combination of which is likely to be partly offset bydeclinesin iPads andMac devices.

Despite similar growth expectations relative to history, the composition of growth is likely to be materially different Relative to the $73bnof revenue growth over the five-year period starting in FY12, we expect even greater revenue growth of $111bnover our four-year forecast window (FY17-FY21E). However, as shown in the comparison in Figure 17and Figure 18, while iPhone sales accounted for three-fourths of the revenue growth in the last fiveyears, we expect the growth in the next fouryears to be more balanced, although iPhones will continueto be the leading contributor to growth. As shown in Figure 18, we expect growth drivers to shift to Services and Other Products (accessories) in addition to the growth in iPhone revenues.

Despite continued volume concerns from investors, we expect revenue growth, although now led by pricing As shown in Figure 19, we forecast growth in revenue from iPhone sales, despite heightened investor concerns around both volumes and pricing. However, we do expect growth in revenues from iPhone sales to moderate from +12% CAGR over the last fiveyears to +9% CAGR for FY17-FY21E.

However, mix of volume and ASP drivers for revenue growth to change relative to historical trends While we do expect continued revenue growth from iPhone sales, we expect the composition of growth drivers to be more heavily weighted to pricing relative to volumes. As shown in the comparison in Figure 20and Figure 21, we expect the drivers of revenue growth to shift from being weighted to volume growth in the last five years to being weighted to ASP growth over the next fouryears.

Services to be second largest revenue growth driver and to more than double FY16 revenues by FY20E We expect Services to turn out to be the second largest revenue growth driver for the company over the medium-term and expect it to comfortably meet the firm’s target of $48bnin revenues by FY20. As shown in Figure 22, we expect Services revenue growth to accelerate and rise at a +23% CAGR over our forecast window. Helped by the strong pace of growth, by our estimates, Services revenue should reach $56bnby FY20E, relative to Apple’s target of $48bn. The forecast growth in Services revenue is led by both growth in the installed base and rise in Services revenue per device in the installed base.

Installed base growth to outpace growth in new devices Services revenue allows Apple to leverage its installed base of devices with consumers relative to annual revenues from device sales being levered to new units sales and being more cyclical around success of certain product launches in certain years. As shown in Figure 23, we expect the installed base of all devices, estimated to be around 1.4bndevices at FY18E end, will continue to increase ata high-single- digit pace to 1.9bndevices by FY21E. However, we believe primary portion of Services revenues will be levered to the installed base of iPhone devices with customers being able to use the same subscription across all their devices. As shown in Figure 23, we estimate the installed base of iPhones (including those with second owners) will be roughly 1bndevices at the end of FY18E, progressing to 1.45bnat FY21E end, implying high-single-digitincreases. Net, we expect the high-single- digit pace of increase in the installed base to outpace the modest declinefor legacy devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Mac devices, positioning the Services group for stronger growth relative to new devices.

Other Products, including Apple Watch, to be third primary driver of medium- term revenue growth The Other Products segment comprises various products, primary among which is the Apple Watch. Additionally, Apple has seen good success with launch of accessory products like Airpods and with the acquisition of Beats. While we expect growth in revenues ofthe Other Products segment to be driven by multiple products, we believe the primary driver will be sales of Apple Watch, which is already the leading smart watch globally.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Margin Outlook: Investment in Services to Be Modest Headwind Gross margins have moderated on a combination of headwinds including memory costs and currency While Apple’sgross margins have improved substantially from the 29.0% in FY06, prior to the launch of the iPhone, they have been range bound around the 38%-40% level for the last three years. Additionally, as shown in Figure 27, gross margins in recent years are lower than the peak gross margin of 43.9% in FY12, led we believe by a combination of the following: 1) increase in memory costs; 2) currency headwinds; 3) increasing exposure to accessory sales at lower margins, partly offset by growth in Services revenue.

Largest capital return program for any US company, pace of repurchases accelerated since tax reform After already returning $275bnof capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends since 2012, Apple announced a $100bnbuyback program in May of 2018. In addition to the$100bnbuyback program, Apple has an existing dividend through which Apple has already promised to return around $14bnannually, the combination of which makes it the largest capital return program for any US company. The pace of repurchases accelerated earlier this year on the back favorable tax reform. We expect Apple to buyback$74bnof stock in FY18E and $70bnof FY19E, to exhaust the $100bnprogram announced in mid-FY18, before accelerating to a pace of around $75bnannually. This compares to repurchases of $165bnbetween FY13 and FY17 (fiveyears), at an average pace of $33bn/year.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Valuation Our SOTP-Based Analysis Suggests +23% Upside to Our December 2019 Price Target We rate Apple shares Overweight with a December 2019 price target of $272, implying +23% upside from current levels. We rate Apple shares Overweight We rate shares of Apple Overweight given our favorable outlook for continued growth in iPhone revenues led by price, combined with significant growth opportunities for its Services segment which is levered to growth in the installed base as well opportunity to increase Services revenue per device in the installed base. We value Apple shares using a blended multiple, which values Apple’s various product segments at different multiples We believe a blended multiple is most appropriate for Apple, which as discussed is expected to see a shift in the composition of growth drivers from hardware sales to services sales. While growth in Services revenues isexpected to be one of the primary drivers of the revenue growth for the company through FY21, it still only accountsfor 20% of total company revenues by the end of our forecast window (FY21). We expect the growth in Services revenue to drive accelerationin revenue growth for the total company beyond our forecast window, as it becomes a greater portion of total company revenues. Our SOTP approach implies a blended 17.5x P/E multiple is appropriate We estimate earnings per share contributions from the various product segments and arrive at our price target by assigning P/E multiple appropriate for the earnings growth outlook for each segment. Key assumptions used in formulating the price target as shown in Table 16are:  iPhone:We use a 14.0x P/E multiple for our iPhone earnings estimate in calendar 2020, in line with the multiple that industry leader in the early 2000s, Nokia, traded at from 2005to 2010 when the firm had a leadership position in feature phones.

Additionally, we believe increasing consumption of content on smartphones is likely to substitute purchases of laptops/notebooks as well as tablets in the future.  Services: P/E multiple of 26.0x on the Services segment, in line with the average trading multiple for a peer group of luxury/retail companies (Costco, Estée Lauder and Home Depot), which are leaders in their respective markets and derive a stickiness for product sales through customer loyalty either in the form of membership programs or brand value. We believe the subscription nature of Apple’sServices segment, with high visibility of revenue and earnings, warrants it beingvalued in line with the leading luxury/retail companies. As shown in Table 15, the average NTM for the peer group is 26.6x.

However, the 16.0x multiple is at a discount to the 25.0x multiple we use to value Apple Watch on account of lower margins for accessory sales in a more competitive market. 37 50-guA 50-voN 60-beF 60-yaM 60-guA 60-voN 70-beF 70-yaM 70-guA 70-voN 80-beF 80-yaM 80-guA 80-voN 90-beF 90-yaM 90-guA 90-voN Avg: 14.2x This document is being provided for the exclusive use of OSKAR ROESKE at HOCHSCHULE FUER TECH & WIRT BERLIN.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 iPhone: Premium Strategy May Limit Volume Opportunity, But Not Revenues Mature penetration of mobile handsets globally makes it one of the most attractive markets The increasing adoption of mobile handsets globally, including both smartphones and feature phones, has driven the market to 2.0bnunits in 2017 from 1.1bnin 2007, representing a +6% CAGR over the last ten-year period. The significant increase means that roughly every fourth individual globally buys a mobile handset each year. Additionally, the installed base globally for mobile handsets is estimated to be roughly 7.4bn, which means that almost every individual globally owns one. The high penetrationandvolume opportunity makesit a very attractive market for new entrants.

Thedisruption ofthe feature phone market by smartphones While the global handset industry demonstrated a strong CAGR of +6% over the last tenyears, within the industry we saw significant disruption led by smartphones marginalizing feature phones to the low-end of the market. As shown in Figure 45, roughly 512mnfeature phones are sold annually relative to 1.5bnsmartphones currently, making smartphones the primary segment within the mobile handset industry. This is relative to ~90% of the total mobile handset industry comprising feature phones in 2007.

Samsung and Apple disrupted the mobile handset industry as new entrants Apple was one of the disrupters in the mobile handset industry with the launch of its smartphone, the iPhone, in 2007. Despite being a premium offering priced at $499, relative to the majority of feature phones available in the market at that time, the iPhone managed to gain share quickly. Other manufacturers, including Samsung, had already been dabbling with the idea of smartphones by then, starting with the Samsung SPH-I300 launched in 2001. However, the market for smartphones received a boost from the launch of the iPhone by Apple and subsequent launches by Samsung, including the Samsung Galaxy in 2009. Nokia, the large incumbent player globally in feature phones, did not focus on keeping up with the changing consumer preference towards smartphones and quickly lost out on its strong position in the market. As shown in Figure 46, Nokia had 49% global market share in 2007 with Apple and Samsung accounting foronly 3% and 2% market share, respectively. Since then, the market has changed dramatically with only two of the top eight companies from 2007 still remaining today. As shown in Figure 47, Samsung and Apple were ranked #1 and #2 in 2017, respectively. At the same time, it is worth noting that the Smartphone market has become more fragmented, with the top three companies now accounting foronly 48% of total shipments, which compares to 65% in 2007.

Emerging countries account for an even greater portion of the installed base As illustrated in Figure 50, despite consumers in Developed countries being early adopters of smartphones, Developed countries only accounted for 20% of the smartphone installed base in 2017, which compares to 24% of smartphone revenues. We believe the higher churn rate and the shorter life-cycle of smartphones for consumers in Developed countries compared to consumers in Emerging countries drives the higher revenue contribution relative to the size of the installed base.

Growth opportunity in Emerging countriesis greater than in Developed countries, but more likely in the low-tier price segments The growth drivers for the smartphone industry are greater in Emerging countries relative to the Developed countries, and thus we expect stronger growth over the medium-term in the Emerging countries. However, with an increasing portion of the growth coming from Emerging countries, the OEMs with products positioned atthe low-tier and at the low end of the mid-tier smartphone marketare more likely to benefit relative to the OEMs with products focused on the premium smartphone market, which includes Apple.

However, Apple has successfully explored a premium pricing strategy to drive revenue growth through consistent increases in prices. As shown in Figure 65, the average selling price of an iPhone has increased +36% since 2007, or +3% per annum, which has recently supported revenue growth as unit shipments have started to plateau.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Consumers experience even greater priceincreases onroll-off of subsidies As illustratedin Figure 66, the price to consumersfor iPhonesin certain countries has increased at an even greater pace relative to the +3% CAGR reported by Apple. Specifically, following the initial launch of the iPhone, telecom service carriers sold iPhoneswith a heavy subsidy to make itmore palatablefor consumersin an effort to grow their respectivesubscriber bases. Carrier subsidies, which were quite prevalent historically in the US, limited the price paid by iPhone consumersfrom 2008 to 2013. Followingthat period,carriers moved away from subsidies and instead began offering consumers monthly installment programs to drive device ownershipand replacement. Figure 66: iPhone Retail Price to Consumer $ per iPhone Note: Retail launch prices may not reflectApple’sreported ASPs given carrier subsidies applied in the period of 2008-13. Source: Company data and J.P. Morgan estimates. Apple’s premium smartphone customers demonstrate low price elasticity As shown in Figure 67and Figure 68, iPhone shipments continued to increase despite the roll-off of carrier subsidies starting in 2013. Whileinvestors are concerned about the price elasticity of consumers given Apple’s pricing strategy, the increase in iPhone shipments long-term indicates to us that investor concerns appear unfounded and the customer demographic targeted by Apple demonstrates very low price elasticity.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Success of pricingstrategy demonstrated withadoption of premium smartphone The steady increase in pricing for iPhones hasbeen led by the success of Apple’s launch of premium smartphones despite concerns aroundprice elasticity. While there is seasonality relative to demand, Figure 69demonstrates that Apple’stop-end smartphonein any particular period hasbeen successful in capturing a significant portion of consumersin each quarterfollowing its initial release, which has resulted in the increase in Apple’sblended average selling price.

Demand for the latest generation smartphone remains very high Despite Apple increasing the price for every generation of iPhone, consumers have shown a strong preference for the latest generationof phones, which largely reflects preference for incremental features that Apple introduces with each new model. As illustrated in Figure 70, the latest generation of iPhone, which is usually introduced in September of each year, has become the primary contributor to unit shipments for the next four quarters, despite the availability of the previousgeneration for a reduced price. In our view, this demonstrates the premium pricing Apple is able to drive through consumer preference for features introduced on the latest generation of the iPhone.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Success of “Plus” models also contributing to success in pricing strategy Until 2017, the “Plus” models were the top-end smartphone in Apple’s portfolio. As shown in Figure 71, “Plus” models increased as a mix of iPhone shipments as Apple successfully drove a significant proportion of customers to upgrade to the larger screen size for a premium price. Despite the launch of the iPhone Xas Apple’s top- end smartphone in 4Q17, it only modestly cannibalized the mix of the “Plus” models, which are still sold at a premium to the corresponding base model with a 4.7 inch screen. For example, the “Plus” and the Xmodel, both at a premium to the base iPhone model with a 4.7 inch display, accounted for 48% of the mix in 2Q18 (26% iPhone Plus + 22% iPhone X), which compares to the “Plus” model accounting for 38% of mix in 1Q17.

Expanding the portfolio with more product offerings in recent generations Starting with the launch of the iPhone in 2007, Apple focused its energy on delivering one quality product every year, following up on the first iPhone launch in 2007 with the launch of iPhone 3G in 2008, iPhone 3GS in 2009, iPhone 4 in 2010, iPhone 4S in 2011, and iPhone 5 in 2012. Starting in 2013, Apple moved to a two- product strategy with the launch of the 5C and 5S, followed by the launch of the 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, and 6S and 6S Plus in 2015. Apple has now moved to a three- product strategy with the launch of the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and the iPhone SE in 2016, followed by the launch of the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X in 2017, and the launch of iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR in 2018. 55 61Q1 61Q2 61Q3 61Q4 71Q1 71Q2 71Q3 71Q4 81Q1 81Q2 Plus Other iPhone This document is being provided for the exclusive use of OSKAR ROESKE at HOCHSCHULE FUER TECH & WIRT BERLIN.

Source: Company reports. Expanding the portfolio, widening the price points By expanding the iPhone model lineup with every generation from one in 2007-12 to three in 2016, Apple is able to offer consumers a wider range of choices in terms of device capabilities, screen dimensions, as well as price points. For example, in the latest generation of iPhones launched in 2018, the price range between the low-end iPhone XRand the high-end iPhoneXS Maxis $350 (starting prices), relative to $100 in 2014 and 2015 when Apple launched two products in each generation. Apple to deliverthe best consumer experience on a small number of models Despite Apple modestly broadening its portfolio over time,we believe itwill continue to focus on delivering a solid consumer experience through a small number of models, rather than pursue a broad portfolio similar to competition. As shown in Figure 73,Apple sells the fewestdifferent phone models relative to its primary competitors in any given quarter. We believe the focus on a smallernumber of models allows Apple to drive higher volume leverage across its portfolio as well as focus marketing spend on fewer products, driving the optimum outcome in relation to both gross margin and operating margins.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Fewer models and premium pricing drive best-in-class productmargins We believe the combination of the premium pricing strategy as well as the focus of both R&D and marketing spend acrossfewer modelscontributes to Apple’s stronger margins on iPhones relative to competitors. As shown in Figure 74, Apple delivers stronger margins than any of its competitors in the smartphone industry. Admittedly, some of the companies mentioned below have business interests outside of smartphones, but we estimate Apple has a leadership in margins forsmartphones on a stand-alone basis relative to any competitive products. The higher operating margins are a function of: 1) higher gross margin led byafocus on premium smartphones; 2) pricing power with the customer demographic purchasing premium smartphones; and 3) lower operating costs, which is a function offocusing on developing 2-3 stand-out smartphone models during a year,allowing for better leverage of costs over greater volumes per phone model.

Specifically, iPhoneX accounted for 30% of the mix of total iPhone shipments to date, which demonstrates that Apple’s strategy of launching top-end smartphones with a competitively superior feature set has been successful.

Success of top-end strategy stands out relative to primary competitor Samsung Apple’s strategy tofocus on the top-end smartphone stands out relative to its primary competitor, Samsung. Samsung has a broader portfolio of devices with a wider range of price points, including some smartphones that are comparable in price to Apple’s top-end phones in certain generations. While we acknowledge the difference in strategies between Apple and Samsung may make a comparison difficult, we think it is important to highlight that as shown in Figure 77, Samsung’s top-end smartphone has only reached ~20% of total shipments.

Apple’s top-end smartphone contributing an even greater percentage of revenue As shown in Figure 78, not only is the iPhone Xalready contributing one-third of Apple’s unit shipments, it is also contributing an even greater percentage of the company revenues—roughly 40% to date.

Samsung’s top-end smartphoneshave contributed a lower portion of revenues While it might not be the most appropriate to compare Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Plus and Galaxy S9 Plus to Apple’s iPhone X, given different portfolio strategies, we believe the comparison can provide insights into the ability to drive towards a very rich mix and maximize margins. As shown in Figure 79, Samsung’s top-end smartphone has historically contributed around 17% of revenue relative to the iPhone X’s ~40%.

Success for Apple and Samsung has been fairly similar with “Plus” sized models Larger screen sizes have been a driver of higher ASPs as well for smartphone manufacturers, with both Apple and Samsung choosing to label the larger screen size models as “Plus” and charging roughly $0-$100 premium relative to the base model. When we focus on shipments of smartphones with screen sizes larger than 5.5 inches for both Apple and Samsung, we find that both have had similar success in driving an increasing mix of shipments from larger screen sizes at a premium ASP. However, the roughly similar contribution of mix from Samsung is driven by a higher number of smartphone models relative to Apple.

Samsung is slowly increasing ASPs, but remains well behind Apple While Samsung might have some top-end smartphones at comparable prices to Apple’s, the average ASP for the Samsung portfolio remains well short of Apple’s. On a year-to-date basis, the average selling price for Apple’s iPhones are $823 (per IDC), which compares to Samsung’s$340. Over the last ten years, Apple has increased average ASP by roughly $202 per IDC relative to Samsung’s $135. While this might indicate more opportunity for Samsung with high-end smartphones, we think it also indicates that Apple has been more willing to push the pricing barrier in conjunction with delivering technology feature setsthat are at least in linewith, if not better than,the best phones in the market.

Samsung is following Apple’s premium pricing strategy Samsung had historically preferred to price its top-end smartphone at a modest discount to Apple in a bid to cannibalize revenue from Apple. More recently, particularly with the recent launch of the Galaxy Note 9, Samsung is now looking to price smartphones in line with or at a premium to Apple. The pricing likely reflects a change in strategy and expectation around price elasticity from Samsung. As reviewed by our Asia Pacific Technology analyst, JJ Park, Samsung likely needs to increase focus on the incremental feature set delivered in the high-end smartphone to be able to successfully upsell consumers. See detailed note here: “Samsung Electronics: Note 9 unpacked: Nothing special withhigher price points”. iPhone: Is the Pricing Strategy Sustainable? Smartphones substituting tablets and laptops; consumers willing to attribute higher share of wallet to smartphone purchase from savings on other devices One of the primary reasons we believe consumers have been willing to pay an increasing amount for smartphones is the increasing convergence of capabilities of a smartphone with those of a tablet and other personal computing devices, including laptops. The increase in hardware capabilities has not been the sole driver; the increasing delivery of web-based content through applications customized for smartphones to keep up with changing consumer preference towards mobility has driven a convergence of the use cases for smartphones relative to other personal computing devices.As shown in Table 18, while the mobile handset industry is still registering modest growth, the marketsfor personal laptops/desktops and tablets are both declining. With smartphones substituting usage of laptops/desktopsand tablets, we believe consumersarewilling to attribute incremental share of wallet to the smartphone, driving limited price elasticity relative to expectations.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Consumers are increasingly spending more time on a smartphone We believe consumers are spending an increasing amount of time on a smartphone instead of other devices, including tablets, which saw a rapid increase in usage in the early part of this decade. The willingness from consumers to pay an increasing amount for the smartphone has stemmed from their desire tohave a richer experience on the device on which they are spending an increasing amount of time. For example, one of the primary drivers for large screen sizes, or “Plus” sized models, was that consumers were increasingly consuming content on their smartphones and wanted larger screen sizes to make it more convenient to read/view, which in turn increased the opportunity for OEMs to raise pricing. Financing has a lot of headroom to allow pricing to increase Developed countries, including the US, are seeing a modest headwind on the replacement cycle for smartphones led by the discontinuation of subsidies by the carriers to facilitate consumer purchases. However, the headwind is largely being offset by the increasing penetration of financing plans to make the purchases more affordable. According to research published by Kantar, 47% of smartphones sold in the US are linked to installment plans, including 51% of iPhonesand 46% of Androiddevices. iPhone: Emerging Counties’ Product and Pricing Strategy Allows for Best Profits, not Volumes Limited product positioning for leverage to growth in Emerging countries Since its launch in 2007, Apple has primarily focused on the premium smartphone market. However,Apple began designingproduct focused on Emerging countriesin 2013, including withthe 5C and the SE. However, product introductions targeting the Emerging countrieshave been infrequent, as we believe Apple continues to prioritize Developed countriesto drive growthas well asthrough increasing revenue over the lifetime of a smartphone rather than through volumes. Apple has limited products targeting Emerging countries Apple has not focused on consistently launching specific products targeting Emerging countries. Apple’s product strategy has involved positioning the prior year’s smartphone modelsas the primary product in most of the Emerging countries, at a significantly lower price than the current generation of smartphones. The strategy of pushing the prior year’s smartphonesin certain Emerging countries allows the pricing to be more affordable by the target demographic. Additionally, with a year of cost reduction opportunities explored on the prior year’s smartphones, Apple can deliver solid margins despite participating in a more price competitive market. Apple’s strategy in Emerging countries offers numerous benefits to financials long-term We believe Apple’s strategy in Emerging countries, in contrast to competitive priority of developing specific products, has several benefits for financials, including:  Pricing of the primary model in Emerging countries is more affordable for consumers. With the launch of iPhones every year, the price of the prior year’s model is trimmed and offers a better price point.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018  Less R&D in developing specific productsfor Emerging countries.With leverage of existing products, Apple avoids new R&D investments to develop specific products for Emerging countries.  Better margins through leverage of costs savings on older generation product. Thefirm has a year of learnings from product manufacturing to drive savings, leading to better gross margins on the smartphone model.  Ability to leverage the investment on one smartphone model for longer period than the life cycle of the product in Developedcountries. With average life cycle of a smartphone in North America close to 2.3 years, the positioning of an older smartphone product inEmerging markets allows the company to fully leverage the R&D in developing a product for a longer duration, allowingfor better operating margins than competition.  Lower incremental marketing spend on new products. Positioning products in Emerging countries,which already have been launched in Developed countries the prior year, creates an aspirational value attached tothe product by the consumer requiring, in our view, limited incremental marketing spend relative to stand-alone products positioned for the Emerging countries. While the combination of the above does not allow for strong volume opportunity, as Apple’s smartphone usually remains at the high-end compared to competitive offerings, it does optimize the profitability, in our view. Increasing “wealth” in Emerging countries to drive iPhone adoption Apple’s pricing strategy allows for the price of the primary iPhone positioned in an Emerging market to remain more stable than in the Developed markets. While the price of the prior year’s model is still at the high-endof consumer spending on smartphones in Emerging markets, we expect more and more consumers to enter the target demographic for Apple with increasing wealth of consumer in Emerging countries. As shown in Figure 83and Figure 84, the average selling prices of a “premium” smartphone in China and India are expected to increase at a robust pace, but lower than the rise in GDP per capita (which we treat as a proxy for changes in disposable income in the region).

Apple is expanding its presence in India to build momentum in the country Applebelieves it is still in the early stages of building its presence in India, including setting up a channel and working on plans relative to owning retail stores in the country. Additionally, the company has invested in building a local supply chain for its smartphones, which is important to meet local regulations and reduce the average selling price to consumers by avoiding tariffs. Further, with the mobile infrastructure in the country improving, led by recent investments from Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, Apple feels more confident relative to the replacement cycle driving towards higher-capability smartphones.

Apple has looked to differentiate its product offering on the basis of capabilities, driving an increasing number of consumers to switch. Apple estimates that in the most recent quarters, 60% of Mac purchases were driven by newbuyers as well as switching customers, including 90% of Mac purchases in China. Most importantly, the growth in Mac purchases has contributed to double-digit growth in the installed base of Mac laptops. 73 0002 1002 2002 3002 4002 5002 6002 7002 8002 9002 0102 1102 2102 3102 4102 5102 6102 7102 8102 This document is being provided for the exclusive use of OSKAR ROESKE at HOCHSCHULE FUER TECH & WIRT BERLIN.

Expect PC shipments to stabilize in coming years We believe volumes of personal computing devices will stabilize in coming years. J.P. Morgan Technology analyst Gokul Hariharanforecasts volume declineof -0.2% y/y in both 2019E, and 2020E, following greater magnitude of declines in the last few years (“Global PC and Server Forecasts PCs staying flattish in 2018, Servers growing at 9% led by hyperscale”).See Table 20and Table 21for details. Forecast Mac shipments to decline modestly, implying market share losses We expect Apple to launch more entry-level Macs in the coming years to broaden the portfolio and target a large demographic. At the same time, we expect Apple to expand capabilities at the high-end of the portfolio to target gaming demand where priceelasticity is limited. However, despite these changes in the portfolio, we expect Apple to give up modest amount of market share, which in turn should drive unit decline on a y/y basis in the backdrop of a largely flat market. Led by the rebound in revenue growth in 2017, following MacBook Pro refreshes, we expect Apple’s focus to remain largely on high-end devices to drive revenue growth even in the absence of unit growth.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 iPad: Product Growth Despite a Challenging Market iPad successfully created the tablet market Apple launched the first iPad in April 2010, creating the tablet market, which immediately gained significant popularity with consumers. The popularity of the iPad led competitors to quickly follow Apple into the tablet market, which resulted in moderationof Apple’s market share; however,Apple still remains the largest player in the category it created. As shown in Figure 105, Apple started with almost 100% share of the tablet market with the launch of the iPad in 2Q2010. Apple’s market share moderated over time to as low as 20% by 3Q 2015, prior to the launch of the iPad Pro, which has driven a recovery in market share.

Despite the moderation in share, Apple is still the leader in the tablet market As shown in Figure 106, despite the moderation of Apple’s share in the tablet market, as a result of a fast-follower strategy by competition, the firm still has the leading share in the tablet market and almost 2x the share of its nearest competitor, Samsung.

Starting in late 2017, iPad units and revenues have rebounded We believe Apple’s latest refresh of the iPad line-up in 2017, including positioning the iPad for the education sector as well as pushing for greater enterprise adoption, has helped drive a recovery in both units and revenue. In calendar 2Q18, Apple reported the fifth consecutive quarter of iPad revenue growth, including share gains in China, rest of APAC, and the US, where it has roughly 60% share of the tablet market. Additionally, Apple believes half of the iPad purchases in the quarter were for new tablet customers as well as those switching from competitors, which has further added to the installed base of devices.

The launch of additional lower-price versions, including iPad mini, likely drove the ASP moderation.

Despite ASP moderation, Apple has increased its premium to the industry While ASPsfor tablets in the industry have been declining in conjunction with the decline in ASP for iPads, Apple has been able to expand its premium relative to the industry by holding off in competing with the less feature-rich and lower-ASP products introduced by competition. As shown in Figure 112, iPad has been able to expand the premium relative to the industry from 110% in 2010 and 127% in 2011 to 186% in 2016, 176% in 2017, and 153% in 2018.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Apple Watch: Growth Driver with Enormous Potential Apple has quickly established itself as a leader in the smart watch market The first Apple Watch was released on April 24, 2015 and has since gained in popularity to become the leading smart watch sold globally. As shown in Figure 59, Apple now has 15% share of the global wearables market, followed by Xiaomi (14%), Fitbit (13%) and Garmin (5%). Figure 113: Wearable Market Share by Brand, 2017 % of Total Shipments Apple 15% 14% Xiaomi Others 52% 13% Fitbit 5% Garmin Source: IDC. The smart watch market accounts for roughly half of the wearables market While we have seen a lot of new competition come into the already intensely competitive wearables market, capabilities are not uniform across smart watches, which are only a partof the overall wearables market. We estimate smart watches account for roughly 50% of the overall wearables market. The US smart watch market is estimated to be about 13mnunits relative to the US wearables market of 30mnunits. Apple Watch shipments gained momentum in 2017 after taking a pause in 2016 As shown in Figure 114, Apple Watch shipments took a pause after a hugely successful first year in which the company’sshare rose to 21% of the wearables market. Subsequently, Apple Watch shipments increased more than 50% y/y in 2017. Apple has disclosed that Apple Watch shipments continued to report strong growth in early 2018, including a mid-40% growth rate in the latest quarter.

See upside to industry expectations for market growth IDC forecasts wearables unit growth to expand at a +12% CAGR through 2022, providing ample growth opportunities to all companies participating in the market. Within the wearables market, IDC forecasts the market for smart watches to expand at a +22% CAGR, from 33mnunits in 2017 to 89mnunits in 2022. We see upside to these already bullish third-party estimates for unit growth in the smart watch market, led by the introduction of additional capabilities in smart watches driven by new digital content and lifestyle tracking features. Additionally, we are in the early stages of 3G/4G capabilities being incorporated into smart watches, which will provide additional flexibility to consumers and should drive a replacement cycle for earlier generation smart watches.

IDC estimates that the US smart watch market will rise at a +19% CAGR through 2022. The strong growth overall for shipments in the US is likely to be accompanied by a moderation in average ASPs as new entrants try to capture market share through less expensive product offerings.

Apple Watch penetration into iPhone installed base still relatively modest Apple Watch is in almost all circumstances a purchase for a consumer who owns an iPhone. We see the Apple Watch appealing to all iPhone users, including secondary owners, as an excellent alternative to traditional watches given increasing features like the pedometer, heart rate monitor, andnotification of calls and messages. We estimate that the sale of roughly 14K Apple Watches in FY17 implies only a 1.4% penetration of the iPhone installed base. We expect the increasing penetration of Apple Watch sales with iPhone users to continue to drive strong growth in Apple Watch units, making unit growth more sustainable than investors may expect. Table 22illustrates our estimate for Apple Watch unit sales and the penetration of the installed base of iPhones.

Theoretically a TAM opportunity of $385bn Even if Apple’s installed base of iPhones were to plateau today, we estimate Apple theoretically could still target a revenue opportunity of $385bnwith the Apple Watch if penetration were to reach closer to 100%. Realistically, the penetration of Apple Watches in the iPhone installed base will be lower and should ramp up steadily over time. We expect to see penetration increase in line with gains in the last two years (see Figure 117), which we believe will result in continued growth for Apple Watch (see Figure 118).

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Total Installed Base Analysis: Switchers to iOS Are Key for Continued Growth Key observationsfrom our installed base calculations:  iPhones are three-fourths of the total installed base, driving increased focus to continue to grow the iPhone installed base.  Switchers to iOS devices and replacement demand are key to driving growth in installed base. With variations in replacement demand likely to be modest at best through the years, the primary driver of installed base growth should rest onthe ability to get consumers to switch to iOS.  As shown in Table 24, if Apple fails to get incremental consumers to switch, replacement demand and new subscriber demand are unlikely to expand enough to offset the shortfall, driving a decline in iPhone unit sales.  As shown in Table 24, decline in iPhone unit sales should lead to only a modest single-digit increase in the installed base, restricting opportunities to drive both replacement-led demand and Services revenue growth in the long-run.  Apple’s strategy to focus on developing the best products, even though at a premium price, is to drive incremental consumers to switch to the iOS platform, which is key for growth.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 HomePod: Needs More Investments in GTM Strategy Amazon and Google captured the market early on Apple launched its smart speaker, the HomePod, in early 2018, almost three years after Amazon’s launch of its smart speaker, Alexa, in November 2014, and more than a year after Google announced the launch of the Google Assistant in November 2016. Not only has Apple lost the first-mover advantage in this market, it has also cededthe installed base to Amazon and Google, which is likely to see a longer life cycle relative to either the iPhone or the Apple Watch. As shown in Figure 119, Amazon has 62% share of the smart speaker market, followed by Google at 31%, and other players being fairly small. Figure 119: Smart Speaker Market Share by Brand, 2017 % of Total Shipments Xiaomi, 1% Other, 2% Sonos, 2% Tmall, 2% Google, 31% Amazon, 62% Source: IDC. US is the primary market for smart speakers currently; we expect improving network infrastructure to facilitate growth in international markets IDC estimates that a total of 43.9mnsmart speakers were sold globally in 2017. Of the 43.9mnunits sold, IDC estimates that 76% or 33.5mnunits were shipped in the US. We believe improvement in network infrastructure in international markets will facilitate stronger adoption of smart speakersin other regions.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Current installed base implies minor penetration of homes In the US, smart speaker sales rose from 14mnunits in 2016 to 34mnunits in 2017, more than doubling within a year. While significant, the overall penetration of homes remains fairly modest. An average of one speaker per home would imply a 25% penetration rate of the 136mnhouseholds in the US. However, we believe thereal penetration is potentially much lower at around half that number with an average household owning two devices instead of one. Undoubtedly, penetration of smart speakers remains fairly low in international markets. We expect Apple to further refine the hardware for the HomePod Apple historically has differentiated its products through superior design and aesthetics in addition to the capabilities of the product itself. However, we believe the HomePod, despite being late to the market relative to Amazonand Google, has failed to appeal to consumers in design and aesthetics. We expect Apple to refine the product further in coming generations. Apple Music can be the driver for HomePod sales While the integration of HomePod with Apple Music could drive growth for Apple Music subscriptions longer-term, we expect Apple Music will drive HomePod sales near-term. Specifically, we expect Apple to look to integrate HomePod and Apple Music into a packaged offering in the near-term as the company looks to leverage the success of the Apple Music platform, which boasts 50% of the market share in streaming subscriptions with 43mnmonthly active users in the US. Despite HomePod’s lackluster start, we do not rule out Apple’s ability to innovate While the HomePod has not been a success for Apple to date, we do not rule out Apple’s ability to innovate in terms of product and strategy to drive adoption. While admittedly HomePod has lagged competitors in the smart speaker market, Apple has successfully entered the smart watch market and wireless headphone market over the last few years and is well on its way to establishing itself as the leader in both. For example, the Airpods (wireless earbuds) have seen significant success in relatively short time after their launch in December 2016 and now have 2% share of the total headphone market (including earphones)organically, and closer to 27% when including Beats, which Apple acquired in 2014.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Services: Leveraging the Installed Base to Drive Growth Servicesto be a $68bnbusiness segment by FY21 Apple has inarguably increased its focus on Services in the last few years. The Services segment comprises revenues from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, and Apple Care. As shown in Figure 121, Services accounted for only 8% of total company revenues in FY12, increasing to 13% in FY17. With Apple on track to easily exceed its target of doubling Services revenuesof $24bnin FY16 by FY20E, we believe Services will account for around 20% of total company revenues in FY21E.

As shown in Figure 124, we forecast Service revenue per device to continue to increase at a +16% CAGR from $21 in FY17 to $38in FY21. We expect the primary driver of the increase to be the higher adoption of Apple Care services (across the portfolio and across greater number of points in the indirect channel for Apple) and Apple Music.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Apple Music: A Service Offering as Good as It Sounds Formidable addition to the Apple ecosystem Apple Music, which launched in June of 2015, is an ad-free music streaming service that boasts a collection of 50mnsongs. Apple offers Apple Music initially as a three- month free trial, after which consumers have the option to choose from various monthly subscriptions at different price points, which fluctuates from country to country. For example, customers can choose between a Student subscription at $4.99/month, an Individual subscription at $9.99/month, and a Family subscription at $14.99/month(e.g.,access for up to six people) in the US. Apple Music is available in 100 countries worldwide and, more importantly, on all Apple devices (including CarPlay) as well as non-Apple PCs, Android devices, and Sonos devices through iTunes or various “app stores”. Changing consumer preferences have led tothe rise of streaming music The music industry has seen a fundamental change over the last decade. The era of downloading music to a device and revenue models dependent on downloads has been replaced to a large extent by music as a service in the form of monthly subscriptions to users. The number of people who pay to stream music has grown at a +54% CAGR since 2012,culminating in an estimated 176 million people globally who stream music. This rise in steaming music has disrupted the traditional incumbents in the music industry and driven a change in business models for most music companies in order to survive. Additionally, it has led to an increased incentive for music distributors like Apple and Spotify to engage with musicians, producers, and music labels to create exclusive relationships to differentiate their streaming services relative to competition.

Streaming music drives growth in the music industry as a whole The music industry had been struggling and revenues were declining drastically led by illegal downloads and unwillingness of consumers to pay for individual downloads. As shown inFigure 127,IFPI, a not-for-profit international organization registered in Switzerland and representing the recording industry,estimates that worldwide revenues for the recorded music industry declined from $20bnin 2000 to aslow as $14bnby 2014 representing the challenges faced by the music industry in the early 2000s. However, with increasing adoption of streaming, the industry started to see an increase in total revenues and has nowreached an estimated $19bnin 2018.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 While streaming services have had a strong pace of growth starting from 2014, the contribution of non-streaming services to overall revenues has declined rapidly. Streaming revenues are expected to continue to grow at a brisk pace offsetting the decline in alternate means of music distribution.

Streaming growing at a solid pace and taking over the primary role from downloads Taking a closer look at Digital Music revenues, we see the increase in streaming revenues complementing the decline in revenues through downloads. The +17% CAGR for Digital music revenues from 2012to 2017comprises a +59% revenue CAGR for streaming, partly offset by the -11% decline in revenues from downloads.

Apple Music’s growth is impressive, but Spotify still holds the streaming crown Spotifyrecentlyannounced that it had surpassed 180mn MAUs, with 83mnof those users paying for the premium service. The difference of 180mn Spotify MAUs versus Apple Music’s 50mn+appears daunting, but one must consider that Apple Music does not offer a free ad-supported version of its service, so the true comparison has to be between Spotify’s 83mn MAUs and Apple’s 50mn+MAUs. While Spotify as a service can monetize the free subscriber base for advertisement revenues, Apple continues to prioritize user experience for paying consumers. As shown in Figure 133, Spotify has been growing users rapidly as well and currently is the leader in the streaming market.

Globally Spotify is the leader; however,domestically Apple is roughly at par While globally Spotify is the leader in streaming services, the user base is much more balanced in the US led by the tie-in of the smartphone to the choice of a subscription service and the high share for Apple in the US smartphone market. We estimate that Apple has roughly half of its subscriber base in the US, i.e.,around 21mnusers, which compares to Spotify’s American user base of around 22mn. Additionally, with higher growth for Apple in the US relative to Spotify, we estimate Apple can soon surpass Spotify’s domestic user base.

Adding to this the 62 countries in which Apple Music and Spotify both operate brings in another 1.2bn potential consumers. This leads to a total TAM of 2.7bn subscribers in 118 countries.

Apple is positioned to address a large TAM with localized pricing In the countries where Apple Music is available, our JPM Internet team observes that Apple Music is an affordable service, making up only 1% of household expenditures. The service is most expensive in Europe, at approximately $11.09/month on average for anindividual plan. This is especially striking when compared to regions such as South America and Africa where the individual subscription is offered for $4.20/month on average. In the U.S, Apple Music is $9.99/month for the individual plan and $14.99/monthfor the family plan (up to six users). According to the 2017 IFPI Consumer Insight report, roughly 22% of streaming plans are family plans.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Apple Music sees higher conversion rate of trial subscribers into paying subscribers Apple’s growth is assisted by the three-month free trial, which is the company’s primary way of gaining new paying MAUs. Unlike Spotify, Apple Music does not offer a free ad-supported version of the product so reliance on the teaser free trial is vital to new consumer onboarding. One year after Apple Music’s launch in mid- 2015, Apple Music had a total of 33mn subscribers, with only 17mn paid subscribers, representing roughly 50%conversion rate. Now, three years after launch in 2018, Apple Music has 50mn+subscribers in total, with 40mn of them paying subscribers, representing an increase of the conversion rate to 80%. Figure 139: Retention Rate Post Free Trial 90% 80% 80% 70% 60% 52% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% 2016 2018 Source: MusicWatch Survey and Apple. Apple Music’s retention rate nears Netflix levels of loyalty Netflix, like Apple Music, does not have an ad-supported subscription,but rather a similar one-month free trial system to attract and retain new consumers. While Netflix has different business priorities, focusing more on original content generation and is in the video streaming industry, it is still an interesting comparison to make due to their similar free trial and no free ad-supported model. We believe Netflix has enjoyed ~90% retention post free trial, something that Apple Music is trending towards. Apple Music subscribers to account for a larger percentage of Apple device owners We believe one of the drivers of growth for Apple Music will be the increase in penetration of subscribers in the installed base, in addition to benefits from the incremental increase in the installed base on an annual basis.We expect the tight coupling of the iPhone,the Apple Watch, and the HomePod with the Apple Music subscription will enable growth in subscriptions for Apple Music within existing installed base of devices. We estimate the penetration of Apple Music is quite low and in the low-single-digit range at this time. We expect growth in subscribers for Apple Music to be driven by an increase in penetration for Apple Music subscriptions within the installed base and with existing Apple users.

Apple Music, we conclude that Apple Music currently serves only 1.7% of the total TAM. However, given Spotify’sand Apple’s strong positioning in streaming services, we believe Apple Music is well positioned to increase penetration of the total addressable market and drive strong revenue growth. As shown in Figure 141, we estimate in 2018 Apple Music only has 1.7% of the total addressable market for subscribers, which we forecast will rise to ~3.7% in 2020.

Strong relationship with artists and music labels part of Apple Music’s long- term strategy It is crucial to have a good working relationship with existing music labels and artists to ensure availability of quality content on the platform, but also in some cases use the relationships to create exclusivity for content and drive differentiation for the platform relative to competition. Apple is at an advantage over Spotify as it has the financial abilityto deploy significantly moreresources towardsimproving the company’s product. Spotify pays approximately 71.7% of revenue to labels and publishers while Apple pays closer to 73%.

As shown in Figure 143, video already accounts for 55% of streaming.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Apple Pay: Cashing In on Mobile Payments Apple Pay set to leveragethe move to digital money Apple Pay, which was launched in October of 2014, is a mobile payment and digital wallet service that allows consumers to make secure payments in stores, apps, and websitesas well as send and receive money via Apple Messages or Siri. In addition, Apple Pay includes the Wallet app, which stores the Apple Pay Cash card (“digital money”), credit cards, debit cards, as well as other items, such as boarding passes, tickets, and reward cards. The Wallet app supports most major credit cards and debit cards around the world. Apple Pay is available on most Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch, that have some combination of at least two user identifications or “two-factor authentication” (e.g.,passcode, PIN, Touch ID or Face ID). Apple Pay incorporates near field communication (NFC) in order to enable wireless payments via point-of-salesystems. Utilizing this technology, Apple Pay supports contactless in-person payments via the iPhoneand Apple Watch, which is generally faster than average card transactions.Importantly, Apple does not store card numbers on the device itself or on any of its servers.Instead,Apple Pay uses a device-specific number and uniquetransaction code; thus,consumers’card numbers are never shared by Apple with merchants. Credit and debit card purchase volume growth a positive trend for Apple Pay As illustrated in Figure 144, JPM Paymentsanalyst Tien-tsin Huangexpects the aggregate credit and debit card purchase volume for Visa and Mastercard to grow 10% from $11trn in 2017 to $15trn in 2020, which is a positive trend for Apple Pay, as credit card transactions of Apple device owners are increasingly being done through Apple Pay. Importantly, creditand debitcard transactions only accounted for 23% of GDP, which is estimated to be closer to 30% in 2020, implying a significant growth opportunity for Apple Pay going forward.

Growing usage of mobile payments by consumers As seen in Figure 145, mobile payment users rose +36% y/y to 721mnin 2017 and are expected to continue to increase at an +13% CAGR through 2020. Importantly, that growth rate is even higher for smartphone mobile payment users. Specifically, smartphone mobile payment users rose +67% y/y to roughly 240mnin 2017 and are expected to expand at a +19% CAGR through 2020.

Growing installed base of NFCterminals supports Apple Pay growth Near field communication (NFC) is the process by which consumers use digital wallets to purchase items at point-of-sale(POS)terminals in merchantlocations. Recently, NFC has seen a massive rate of adoption,particularly in the US whereover two-thirds of merchants havean NFC-capable POS terminal, which we believe is key to growing mobile payments. As seen in Figure 147, the installed base of NFC-ready POS terminals stood at 55mnin 2017 and is expected to grow +16% per year to 112mnin 2022, which we think is being supported by Visa’sand Mastercard’s recent mandatesthat all POS terminals be NFC enabled by 2020.

Apple Pay also entering the P2P payment market with Apple Pay Cash Peer-to-Peer (P2P) payment has also seen a rise in consumer adoption given its ability to transfer money from one person to another person in a relatively seamless manner, unlike traditional methods that require the use of the banking system. Apple Pay Cash, launched in December of 2017, allows users to transfer and receive money, via Apple Messenger or Siri, free of charge when using a debit card and includes a 3% charge when using a credit card. Additionally, after receiving money, users can store the money in their Apple Pay Cash card, which is stored in the Wallet app. To that end, we think the strong adoption of P2P payments is most evident by Venmo’s (owned by PayPal) recent success as seen in Figure 148. Specifically, Venmo’s purchase volumes have increased at a +115% CAGR since 2015. Figure 148: Venmo’s Purchase Volume $ in Billions $40 $35 $35 $30 $25 $20 $18 $15 $10 $8 $5 $0 2015 2016 2017 Source: Company reports.

Morgan. Apple Watch sees a strong upgrade –units likely to keep surprising Apple Watch units have been growing ~40% yoy, after the launch of the LTE- enabled Apple Watch. The Series 4 launch also is a strong upgrade in the product line-up, with 30% larger screen size and broader price coverage. We believe this is positive for Quanta (main EMS)andASE (SiP module). The Higher Price and Tariff Uncertainties to Cap Demand iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are available from Sep 21 in 33 countries with prices from $999 and$1099 respectively, which is in line with expectations, similar to iPhone X last year. iPhone XR will start pre-orders from Oct 19 and shipping from Oct 26 in 59 countries with price from $749, similar to our preview but a tad more expensive than market consensus at $699. The available timing for LCD iPhone is also later than expected and one month behind the OLED iPhones. Given the higher entry price range and the lingering trade tariff uncertainties, we believe flat Y/Y comp would be a challenging goal to achieve. We already witness some Asia iPhone suppliers revisingdown outlook, likely driven by muted initial volumesfor iPhone XS. However, we do not expect order cut on iPhone XR before the phone is on the market in late October. Weexpect negative sentiment across the Apple names whereas iPhone XS/XS Max plays including Largan(dual-lens), Alps (dual-OIS), LG Innotek (dual-camera), AAC (acoustic component), Samsung (OLED), and Honhai (casing and assembly) may see largerswing in the next month.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 27 September 2018 Low Volume Expectation in 2H18; Position for 2019 Upgrade The Apple Supply China Index has underperformed the Bloomberg APAC Tech Index by over the past month. Wethink the Street expectations are fairly low but Apple supply chain stocks are likely to staymuted for the next few monthsunless any positive data flow. However, we believe the market focus byyear end will shift to 2019 iPhone, which may see the most significant design change and upgrade in rear camera. We believe chances for both OLED iPhone models to incorporate Triple Camera plusTime-of- flight (“ToF”) 3D sensing in 2019 are high, and the LCD model willlikely be upgraded to dual camera from single.The key beneficiaries in Asia would be Win Semi, LG Innotek, and Largan. Seeour Global 3D Sensing & Triple Camera sector report.We are also positive on TSMC, AAC, Chipbond, Catcher, Flexium and Pegatron in Asia.

Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating.

PATEL, CFA RATING PRICE TARGET PRICE $1,626.03 - BUY $3,700.00 $3,135.66 $3,552.25 DAN MEDINA AMZN Gaining Share and Momentum Following the favorable efficacy news of Pfizer and Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccines, we surveyed STEPHEN LENGEL ~330 consumers on shopping habits and upcoming plans. Our key conclusions relating to AMZN from this work include: 1) 80% of the respondents stated that they’d shop the same or more online post-pandemic, with AMZN a clear beneficiary; 2) ~44% of survey respondents stated that 50%-100% of their holiday shopping is already finished, implying that Amazon’s Prime Day pulled forward shopping calendars and spending; 3) 85% of those surveyed stated they'd shop KEY DATA as much or more on AMZN after the pandemic ends, with about 50% saying they prefer AMZN Market Cap (MM) $1,573,321.1 because it sells everything; and, 4) Only 24% of respondents said they'd return to offline retail Price (11/17/2020) $3,135.66 stores on the other side of the pandemic. 52-Week Range $1,626.03 - $3,552.25 Vaccine for Covid-19 won’t disrupt growing e-commerce loyalty: Following news of Pfizer’s and Shares Outstanding 501.75 Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccines’ effectiveness, we asked consumers how a vaccine would impact their Avg. Daily Volume 5,325,085.5 online shopping behavior. About 63.8% of respondents indicated that they’d shop the online channel Total Debt/Cap. 45.58% the same as they did during the pandemic, which supports our industry thesis that digital commerce will remain strong on the other side of Covid-19. Another 16.4% of consumers indicated they’d shop ESTIMATES online even more. About 16% indicated they’d shop more in stores and less online. Net, 80% of those FY (Dec) 2019A 2020E 2021E surveyed said they’d shop the same or more online than they did during the pandemic. With AMZN EPS being the e-commerce market share leader, we see it as the biggest beneficiary of this trend. Q1 7.09A 5.01A - Because of AMZN, Holiday shopping well underway: We asked consumers when they’d shop for Q2 5.22A 10.30A - Holiday. About 18.5% indicated they completed most of their shopping in October through mid- Q3 4.23A 12.37A - Q4 6.47A 6.50E - November, and another 25% indicated they were about half way done.

About 27% plan to begin shopping around Thanksgiving/Black Friday and Rev. (MM)($) only 11% plan to begin shopping in December. In our view, Amazon’s Prime Day in October pulled Year 280,522.0A378,074.0E434,423.0E forward the shopping calendar. Given it had first mover advantage, we expect AMZN be the largest Growth Rev 20.5% 34.8% 14.9% beneficiary of spending moving earlier on the calendar. AMZN momentum should continue after the pandemic: We asked how shopping on Amazon would change if/when the Covid-19 vaccine comes out. About 69% indicated they’d shop Amazon the same as they did during the pandemic (when AMZN's demand surged) while another >15% indicated they’d shop it even more. Another 1.5% indicated they don’t shop Amazon but planned to do so. Net, >85% of those surveyed planned to shop AMZN the same or more going forward. RELEVANT DISCLOSURES BEGIN ON PAGE 5 OF THIS REPORT. At a Glance OUR INVESTMENT THESIS Our investment thesis is that AMZN has several hidden value multipliers that suggest it is worth between $4,500 and $5,000/share. We call these AMZN's: 1) TAM Expansion Multiplier; 2) Services Company (not Product) Multiplier; 3) $600B of Media Asset Value (largely hidden) Multiplier; and 4) Ecosystem Value Multiplier. We believe that Services Segment revenue and margins (including advertising and subscription) are growing faster than AMZN's ecommerce assets, which implies valuation multiple expansion over time. Also, we believe that AMZN invests billions of dollars every quarter in growth initiatives, which understates the normalized economic power of its assets. Additionally, AMZN has an outstanding 15-year track record of turning its growth investments into new businesses with high ROIs, such as AWS and Advertising. BULL CASE ASSUMPTIONS OUR CASE ASSUMPTIONS BEAR CASE ASSUMPTIONS AMZN's Service Sales continue to report We assume that COVID-19 accelerates Extra COVID-19 costs have no long- robust profit growth that drives higher consumer adoption of AMZN's Product term benefit to AMZN and merely offset ROICS and funds new TAM-expanding sales near term and Services Sales (at the extra revenue recognized during adjacencies. much higher margins) longer term, which COVID-19. Competitors are forced to results in strong over-delivery of FCF and catch up with AMZN, thereby lowering ROIC growth between 2021-2023. AMZN's ROICs.

Daily Volume 5,325,085.5 Total Debt/Cap. 45.58% Amazon.com, Inc. / 2 November 18, 2020 Consumers have changed not just where they shop but how they transact: We asked which new habit formed during the pandemic would remain after it’s over. Over 41% of consumers indicated they’d shop for most products online and have products delivered to them; we see this as a positive for Amazon (AMZN) in particular and it should reinforce Prime membership. About 19% indicated they’d buy online and do curbside pickup while 15.5% indicated they’d buy online and pick up in store. Only 24% of respondents voted to go back to their old habits by vising stores. For most retailers, foot traffic has been cut in half or worse during the pandemic, and our survey results keep us cautious on the timing and magnitude of their recovery. Why drives AMZN's loyalty? We also asked the biggest reason for shopping Amazon. About 49% voted that it’s because Amazon sells virtually everything, >31% preferred its fast and free shipping for Prime members, 14% like it for its low prices, and 6% liked having access to Prime Video and other benefits. In our view, AMZN’s scale and industry-leading shipping abilities will remain competitive moats that’ll be difficult for competitors to replicate. Amazon.com, Inc. / 3 November 18, 2020 VALUATION (PRICE TARGET: $3,700.00) ■ Our AMZN price target is based on a DCF valuation. We use a WACC of 6.5% and a long-term nominal growth rate of 2%. The standard DCF is widely used on Wall Street because it is rigorous bottom-up valuation of the enterprise based on discounting its long-term cash flows and removing the impact of non-cash accounting conventions. ■ Our AMZN price target embeds a 10-year growth rate of 12.5% annually beginning in FY21, and represents a 26.5x multiple of forward year (FY22E) EBITDA. POTENTIAL UPSIDE DRIVERS AMZN's investment positives include an enormous TAM, rapidly growing market share of e-commerce gaining revenue from offline retail, Services revenue raises profit margins and ROICs, a strong balance sheet and a best-in-class consumer brand. RISKS TO TARGET Risks to our AMZN target price include significant extra COVID-19 costs in 2Q20, regulatory risks, competition, investment ROIs, and/ or economic weakness/recession.

That growth might be low single-digits, but it’s growth nonetheless for a stock that is discounting a fear of revenue and EPS declines. CEO Tim Cook also indicated that iPhone units would grow, which should be welcome news to investors after recent soft commentary from US wireless operators about upgrade rates. While there are plenty of adjustments within our financial model, we continue to expect Apple to generate $10 in EPS in Fiscal 2016, reflecting 8% EPS growth, thanks to the continued aggressive share repurchase. This may be a slowdown from the 43% growth in Fiscal 2015, but we believe it should be enough to deserve a 16.0x P/E multiple and $160 price target for Apple, given the strong free cash flow conversion. iPhones Over the past week, the commentary from US operators about declining phone upgrade rates was starting to concern us, but apparently China continues to chug along unabated, with mainland units growing 120% during the quarter. As we learn more about phone upgrade programs, we agree with management’s assessment that the benefit might actually be larger in future years than what they are seeing now. We also think there is an opportunity for Apple to expand its own upgrade program internationally, which could further accelerate replacement rates. We maintained our estimate of 80 million iPhone units sold in the December quarter, recognizing that the US might not be as strong as we first thought. We took down our March estimate to 62.5 million units from 66 million in recognition of the potential impact of launching the iPhone into 50 markets earlier than we expected. Our new estimate reflects 2.2% unit growth in the March quarter and 5% growth for the year. We maintain our estimate of 4% ASP erosion in Fiscal 2016 as it seems implausible that Apple can continue the 5 consecutive quarters of annual iPhone ASP growth. The net impact is for slight growth in revenue for iPhones in 2016. iPads iPads continue to disappoint, declining y/y for the seventh consecutive quarter. However, the ASP outlook is improved based on the current quarter’s results and the launch of the iPad Pro. As a result, our estimate for a decline in iPad revenue was cut in half to -5% from -10% in Fiscal 2016. Services There are several factors that have led us to increase our services revenue by $1.7 billion for Fiscal 2016. The proliferation of Apple products globally from new and used purchases is leveraging the launch of Apple Music and obvious traction in Apple Pay, which got an added boost from a new deal with American Express for international use. Our new expectation of 10% growth is in-line with the growth rate Apple delivered in Fiscal Q4 and all of Fiscal 2015, yet the dynamics for accelerating growth are clearly present. BTIG LLC Walter Piecyk www.btigresearch.com 2 Apple Watch While Apple does not report Apple Watch revenue or units, we estimate it sold 3.5 million in the quarter, generating $1.5 billion in revenue. We cut our Fiscal 2016 Apple Watch unit estimate by 15 million, to 35 million, resulting in a $6.3 billion negative impact to our Fiscal 2016 estimate. Those cuts were offset partially by higher revenue estimates for AppleTV and iPod refresh. Tax rate and share repurchase There is no change to our overall operating margins as a slight increase in our gross margin estimate was offset by slight increases in R&D and SG&A. Higher other income and a 30 basis point reduction in our estimated tax rate helped offset some of the operating reductions detailed above. Apple bought back $13.3 billion of stock during the quarter versus our estimate of $12.5 billion. The purchases were also completed at an effective price of $109 versus our $130 estimate at the start of the quarter, resulting in 26 million more shares purchased than we estimated. This helped to offset a $1 billion reduction in our Net Income estimate based on the adjustments above. Where are we versus consensus? Our $3.30 FQ1 EPS estimate is at the high end of management’s implied guidance range and $0.08 above consensus going into last night’s report. Our $10 Fiscal 2016 EPS estimate is $0.20 above consensus. Our revenue estimates are $1 billion higher than consensus for FQ1 and $2.7 billion for the year. Buy Apple is converting 30% of its revenue into free cash flow, generating $70 billion of free cash flow annually. This implies an 11% FCF yield relative to its $650 billion market cap. That is simply too high of a yield given its market position, expectation of growth and high margins, regardless of the much lower level of revenue growth and EPS expectations for 2016 detailed above. Even with no growth in EPS, we believe Apple’s valuation is too low based on cash generation. Apple bought back over 5% of its stock over the past year and will buy in another 6% this year if the stock remains at these levels. . Our $160 price target is based on 16x our Fiscal 2016 EPS estimate of $10.

Amazon is one of the world’s largest retailers (with a sideline in fast-growing and high-margin advertising activities) and also owns one of the world’s largest software businesses. Despite its current massive size, we see Amazon’s opportunities as mostly unconstrained based on a successful track record of capitalizing on consumer and IT department spending. In the remainder of this note we provide further details on how we think about the company’s future revenue and profitability trends, looking at the retail business separately from AWS. We also assess other valuation considerations which lead us to our $1920 YE2019 price target. With a stock trading more than 15% below this level at the present time, we initiate coverage with a Buy recommendation. REVENUE FORECAST Amazon is massive, but small in context of the commercial opportunity the company is pursuing. With a focus on selling as many consumer goods as possible and much success in attempting to do so, we see Amazon‘s retail activities as a play on global consumer spending, which is much broader than pure retail or today’s e-commerce business. In terms of thinking about the market opportunity, we would point to a recent Euromonitor estimate of global consumer spending as equalling $45 trillion in 2018. Given Amazon’s ambitions and its demonstrated abilities, we think this is a reasonable TAM (total addressable market) to consider. To calculate Amazon’s share of this TAM, we assume revenue from its marketplace is derived from a 15% take-rate, which leads to a global GMV for Amazon of around $405 billion during 2018. Including revenue from subscriptions (appropriate, given the inclusion of Prime in that line item) we can estimate that Amazon captured $420 billion of consumer-related activity. From this we calculate an approximate 1% share of its TAM potential. Of course, a TAM defined so broadly is intended to convey that there is significant ongoing growth potential for the company. In lieu of meaningful new initiatives or acquisition-related activity, we would expect that growth can continue at incrementally diminished rates vs. the recent past. Acceleration is unlikely (if not implausible) given the difficulty any company would face in sustaining or meaningfully improving upon prior growth which build on Amazon’s already-massive scale. With this philosophy underpinning our numbers, we have arrived at a growth rate for non-AWS-related businesses of around +22% in both 2017 and 2018 pro forma for 2017 transactions (which primarily means Whole Foods), declining towards +13% in 2023 and then on towards a ~+6% growth rate outside of recessionary periods by 2030. While a model based upon diminishing growth is simplistic, we arrived at this approach after determining it was more appropriate than other methods of forecasting. Initially we attempted to assess the total addressable market for e-commerce at global and regional levels with an eye towards estimating Amazon’s share of that market at any given time. However, we found limitations in data available and further limitations in applying that data to Amazon specifically for several reasons: • E-commerce retail sales data (as produced by the US Commerce Department and Census Bureau, for example), while likely an accurate reflection of a fixed definition of e-commerce, won‘t reflect the increasingly omni-channel nature of retail. Platforms such as Amazon are likely to increasingly rely on physical locations as much as traditional retailers such as Walmart and Target will increasingly rely on their digital platforms to sell products and provide customers with related information. Amazon will be increasingly indifferent as to whether or not a sale is fulfulled in part or in whole online or at a store. - 2 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group • Modelling Amazon’s revenue share against broader retail sales data won’t capture that Amazon will increasingly look to non-retail forms of consumer spending as a source of revenue growth, as with their efforts in entertainment services and healthcare. • Using market share estimates for a global company is even more difficult because of the amount of cross- border buying activity that occurs. Our understanding is that any data tracking e-commerce sales for a given country will not capture spending which originated in a separate country. This distorts attempts to model market share at anything less than a global level. We see several of the company’s revenue streams as fluid for purposes of modelling. We first consider the company’s retail, marketplace and subscription-related businesses to be a relatively fluid set of revenue streams with any one category of revenue as replacable by any one of the others. Our conversations with industry participants have left us with an understanding that Amazon may prioritize or deprioritize different activities, all with an eye towards optimizing their relationships with consumers. • On first glance at Amazon, one might assume that marketplace / third-party sales are more desirable for Amazon vs. first-party sales given higher margins and greater scale potential. However, we understand that the company benefits in many ways from sustaining a robust first-party business, including the capacity to produce more high margin private label goods, a superior ability to manage their overall customer relationships and a better strategic read on the economics of other retailers and manufacturers who use the marketplace. • As described above, we see Amazon as ultimately indifferent between online/delivery or physical store- based fulfulllment given the timeliness of picking up certain goods, the balance of consumer interests between online and in-person shoping for many catgeries and a competitive environment which is increasingly omnichannel. • Subscriptions could theoretically serve as an incremental revenue stream, except that most of the company’s subscription revenue is via Prime, which is likely best viewed as part of a given consumer’s overall spending on products at Amazon. And even if we only look at future subscription services we can envision that Amazon will price services in context of those services‘ contributions to increased spending on retail products. Advertising is related to the retail opportunity, but also somewhat independent. The company generated around $9bn of related revenue in 2018. Grouped under Other revenues (with probably 90% of those revenues accruing to advertising), Amazon’s approach to advertising is centered around helping the company reduce prices consumers pay for products. For this reason, in some ways advertising is a means to an end rather than the end itself at Amazon. However, because of Amazon’s scale and the desirability of its data and ad inventory, advertising should be able to provide an opportunity for incremental growth that is independent of consumer spending trends. Amazon was on pace to generate well over $10bn in Other revenue during 2018, which we think includes around $9bn from advertising, the bulk of which ran in the US. Of the $9bn, around $3bn may have originated with co-op or trade-related promotion budgets, equivalent to 2-3% of the company’s first-party sales. In general we think these budgets should grow at least as fast as Amazon’s first-party sales, but they could grow faster as fast moving consumer goods (FMCGs) become increasingly important suppliers of goods to the company (our understanding is that companies in this sector can invest as much as 20% of their revenue in trade promotion programs with retailers, although we have also heard that the figure can be as low as 2% for some brands). We assume the remainder, or around $6bn of ad revenue, is derived from conventional digital advertising budgets. This pool of spending represents a more significant opportunity for Amazon than trade promotion - 3 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group budgets. We estimate the company recognized $5bn in US advertising revenue from conventional ad budgets during 2018 (out of a digital ad market we estimate was worth $106bn), with a large percentage of those sales made possible with inventory outside of Amazon’s owned and operated platforms. Although large brands are allocating growing shares of their budgets to Amazon inventory, the growing numbers of third-party merchants on Amazon’s marketplace might be increasing their spending in a more aggressive manner, prioritizing Amazon’s relatively scarce O&O advertising “real estate.” If this occurs, the larger brands who pioneered the use of that inventory would probably respond by increasingly using Amazon’s DSP / managed service to buy inventory off the platform. The separation between trade and brand budgets is important for investors to consider, not least as it impacts how investors should think about the advertising revenue potential for Amazon and the opportunity (or lack of an opportunity) for new budgets to flow into the industry. Conversations with large advertisers have conveyed to us that there is no one-size fits all approach to budgeting for Amazon, with some integrating activities between brand and trade promotion budgets, but those examples appeared to be the exception rather than the rule. Beyond bureaucratic considerations (with trade sales and marketing teams typically reporting through very different lines in their companies, with very different business objectives and separate budgets) in some instances avoidance of co-ordination is intentional: several large marketers cited to us the US Robinson-Patman Act (a law which bars price discrimination – including compensation for advertising and other services – between manufacturers and similar types of retailers) as a factor limiting the degree to which brand and trade teams co- ordinate their efforts. To the extent that budgets flow into Amazon from other sources, we have learned of a range of different approaches that different marketers take. We have heard from some marketers who will fund search on Amazon from Google budgets, but also heard from others who will leave search on Amazon to the trade team to fund in isolation from other budgets. Display budgets could flow from general display advertising or from Facebook or Google or anywhere else. And of course, as Amazon develops its connected TV offerings and ultimately makes more of its original programming available on an ad-supported basis, it will probably be able to compete for TV budgets. Amazon’s Fire TV box is a key initiative in helping the company monetize other programmers‘ connected TV inventory, and conversations we have had with industry participants convey to us that Fire is well-positioned to compete with Roku or other sellers of connected TV ad inventory. Separately, we think that smaller advertisers or those who primarily sell their goods on the web (especially through Amazon’s marketplace) are more likely to allocate a generally fixed percentage of their sales to Amazon ad inventory. Those same advertisers are also likely to be willing to pay relatively higher prices given the relative ease with which they can connect ad impressions to sales (at least vs. larger brands, where making such assessments are much harder). Accounting for these factors, we forecast $38bn in revenue by 2023, with advertising growing faster than any other revenue stream at Amazon. For 2018 we estimate advertising is growing by close to +70% on an underlying basis (excluding the accounting change that caused Amazon to recognize trade promotion ad spending as revenue rather than a reduction in costs of goods sold) and assume deceleration in subsequent years to arrive at an estimate of $33bn in conventional ad revenue (or $38bn including trade promotion budgets) by 2023. For reference, Interpublic’s Magna estimates total digital advertising of $406bn at that time, or $339bn outside of China, where Amazon might be harder-pressed to compete for ad budgets vs. the rest of the world. At around 10% of the global total in 2023, Amazon will easily be the “third force“ in digtial advertising after Google and Facebook, although it will still be substantially smaller than the $215bn in annual revenue we expect Google to generate or the $59bn we expect to see from Facebook. We recognize that there are obstacles which need to be overcome for Amazon to sustain the growth that we expect: conversations with buyers convey that Amazon’s ad products remain very limited in their features vs. pure-play ad tech competitors, and do not yet have comprehensive capabilities around brand safety, for example. - 4 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group Improvements are likely to be made over time, helping the company secure a growing “share of wallet” among existing domestic customers. Further, the company will need to enhance its selling efforts and succeed in selling to non-endemic marketers (i.e. those with products in categories which don’t tend to sell on Amazon or via e- commerce), who today likely account for a small share of the Amazon’s ad revenues. We see AWS as entirely separate from the retail business, and also see the division as capable of continously growing by sustaining its existing revenue streams and expanding with new products in the future. A remarkable growth story in its own right, AWS should end 2018 as a business with more than $25bn in revenue, by itself almost as large as the world’s fourth largest software company, SAP. With significant revenue streams from storage, computing, networking and other software, Amazon has firmly established itself as capable of deploying new products and servicing IT departments of companies large and small around the world. To model revenue growth at AWS, we recognize that we might look at TAMs for AWS‘ core products and make estimates of AWS‘ share and the trajectory of its share. However, this would ignore that Amazon is undoubtedly going to continue expanding its product offerings as well, including an expansion beyond software to include more hardware, too. For reference, Gartner estimated in October that global enterprise software spending was to be $405bn during 2018. Enterprise-focused hardware would add to this figure as would other forms of IT spending, which was forecast to total $3.7 trillion in 2018, including devices, IT services and communications services. With substantial upside potential for AWS and a strong track record, we think we can safely assume significant ongoing revenue growth for the foreseeable future. Reinforcing this point, as of the end of 3Q18, the company had a $17.8bn revenue backlog associated with AWS for contracts whose terms exceed one year and which were not otherwise reflected in its financial statements, with an average contract life of 3.5 years (implying ~$5bn of revenues to be generated each of the next 3.5 years from sales activities which were already performed). Notably, the $17.8bn figure was up from $16.0bn in 2Q18 and $12.4bn in 1Q18. KEY ECONOMIC RISKS Concerns about an economic downturn are worth considering in looking at Amazon, although not explicitly incorporated into our model at this time, which assumes ongoing economic growth for the foreseeable future. While AWS probably holds up well because of the secular growth trends it is driving and the long-term contracts it has with many of its customers, the retail business might face risks because of the relative maturity of e- commerce and likelihood that consumer spending trends would probably negatively impact the company in a way they didn’t during the last recession. As well, overall digital advertising budgets would probably be cut if the economy weakened materially. To the extent that concerns around economic weakness in China play out, Amazon might be negatively impacted to the degree that many of the companies using its marketplace and advertising products are based there. One intelligence firm (Marketplace Pulse) published an estimate late last year indicating that 39% of the Amazon marketplace’s top sellers in the top five European markets were based in China, up from 15% two years earlier. They estimate that the share of US revenues from Chinese third-party sellers is likely higher than the 39% figure. Changes to postal regulations which could impact the cost of shipping both internationally and domestically could also factor into Amazon’s business over time. PROFIT MARGIN FORECAST We model Amazon’s margins in terms of a) AWS and b) everything else as two separate pools of profitability. We model taxes in a manner that is generally consistent with our outlook for other companies. - 5 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group Our model incorporates an assumption that Amazon’s non-AWS revenues will generate a 5.0% operating income margin in the long-run. In the United States, retailers earn a slightly-better-than 3% after-tax profit margin on average, according to data from the US Census Bureau. This should equate to a slightly-better-than 4% operating income margin. There are clearly advantages to scale: industry-leader Walmart has earned operating income margins of 5-6% over the past few years. When assessing what 5.0% means, we think it’s important to note that Amazon’s accounting choices differ from its peers. Looking at regional data for North America – excluding AWS, but including third-party sales – Amazon produced a 5% margin over the last twelve months (3Q17 through 3Q18), up from 2% in the prior calendar year period and 3% in the year before that one. Importantly, it’s worth noting that Amazon recognizes both stock-based compensation expense and depreciation on an accelerated basis (unique among stocks we cover). Consider that depreciation alone (including amortization of property and equipment acquired under capital leases, but excluding other amortization related to internal software development and capitalized content costs) amounted to $3.0bn in Amazon’s North America segment during 2017. For reference, Walmart had $3.7bn of combined depreciation and amortization for its US segment during the most similar period (ending Jan. 31, 2018). The impact of adding back whatever the depreciation is by itself is relatively pronounced on Amazon’s margins considering that Walmart’s revenue base was three times larger than Amazon’s. While we don’t have allocations of stock-based compensation expense to geographic territories post 1Q16, if we assumed that 2015 levels of stock-based compensation for North America as a percentage of revenue held up in 2017, Amazon would have recognized around $2.2bn in stock-based comp in the region. By contrast, across all of Walmart’s divisions, only $626mm in stock-based compensation was recognized during the comparable period. Adding these non-cash costs back to operating income allows us to calculate a 7.0% figure for Wal-Mart’s US region (vs. a 5.6% as- reported operating income margin) and 8.2% for Amazon’s North America region (rather than a 2.7% as-reported operating income margin). We think similar trends are at play internationally, with reported margins depressed by the company’s accounting choices. More generally, we think that Amazon will want to cap its retail profit margins in order to sustain its competitive advantages and encourage more top-line growth. The company can theoretically squeeze its suppliers, but if Amazon is too aggressive, manufacturers may alter their preferred mixes of first-party and third- party online and offline retail channels and partners, and may more aggressively invest in business models which encourage direct-to-consumer initiatives along the way. Critically, prices need to remain relatively low in order for consumers to continue to prioritize buying from Amazon vs. competitors. Further, Amazon will want to continually invest in physical / retail stores and will either choose or be forced to increase spending on labor and other social goods given the company’s size and de facto social responsibilities. Higher costs from these sources will be at least partially offset by growth in revenues from higher margin activities such as advertising (with very high margins for O&O ad sales and lower, if still relatively-high margins for advertising on its ad network), the third- party marketplace and an expanded focus on private label brands. Put together, we would expect that Amazon’s non-AWS revenues will be able to hold up with higher-than-industry average levels, with ongoing improvements as the aforementioned margin-enhancing activities (advertising, the third-party marketplace, private label goods, etc.) account for a growing share of the company’s revenue base. Our model assumes long-term as-reported operating income margins of 5%, up vs. the nearly 3% level we expect the company to produce during calendar 2018. From benchmarking AWS against its peers, we are comfortable assuming mid-30s operating income margins for this segment. As AWS competes in relative isolation from the rest of the company, we think that the business can be compared to margins we see in similar businesses within the software world. For reference, during the last three fiscal years Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment (which houses the Azure business which most directly competes with AWS) has had GAAP operating income margins ranging between 33% and 37%. As - 6 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group another example, Oracle’s margins have held relatively steady at 34% during the same time-frame. Adobe’s has ranged lower, but is on an upswing rising from 26% in 2016 to 31% last year and we forecast it to be on pace towards a high-30s range over the next few years. Salesforce.com is lower, sitting in the mid-single digits on a GAAP basis, but will inevitably trend to a substantially higher level as the company matures (specifically, the company anticipates an estimated 35% margin for its business at maturity). On this basis, we assume a mid-30s margin level at maturity for AWS, up from 2017’s 25% level and the 28% we expect for 2018. Taxes are low, but also likely face pressures over time. We assume a 25% rate in the long-run for Amazon as we do for most of the companies in our coverage universe, despite significantly lower levels at present. We expect taxes to generally rise for Amazon, as we do for all companies under our coverage over the very long-term. For the foreseeable future we expect taxes to be reduced in large part because of the current treatment of stock-based compensation (which probably reduces the company’s tax bill by around $1.5bn in 2018). At the same time, as evidenced by the company’s recent HQ2 contest, the company may very well be able to play off various governments against each other to realize further savings that extend into the far-off future. Nonetheless, we assume that over time taxes converge to a 25% level for Amazon. VALUATION CONSIDERATIONS The DCF we use to drive our valuation for Amazon attempts to calculate the company’s long-term cash-producing capacity by beginning with unadjusted net income and adding back non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and some near-term adjustments for working capital. We deduct capital for acquisitions and capital expenditures as reported, but also eliminate principal repayments of capital and finance leases (given the company’s reliance on capital leases to fund a large share of its capex) in a manner which essentially offsets the D&A add-back. Our approach to determining Amazon’s cost of capital is identical to the approach we use for other companies under our coverage, with one cost of capital for the near-term (through 2023) and a separate higher cost for periods beyond 2023. We also use a variable to capture the relative desirability or lack of desirability of a given sector or company (implicitly reflecting amplified or depressed flows of funds into a given stock). We are currently using costs of capital of 11.4% for the long-run (8.3% in the short-term) that are identical to those we use for Google, Salesforce, Adobe and Twitter, but lower than what we use for Facebook. Our long-term revenue growth variable is +7.0%, which is similar to Adobe, slower than Salesforce and faster than Google and Facebook. - 7 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group RISK FACTORS We see the following among Amazon’s key risks: • Regulation: The size of Amazon’s retail business has a meaningful impact on consumers, its competitors and the societies in which they operate. To the extent that governments determine that they must cause Amazon to behave differently, they could constrain the company’s growth opportunities or cause it to incur additional costs. • Competition: Competition is pervasive for Amazon, and so far in its history Amazon has navigated through that competition in an incredibly successful manner. However, there are limited barriers to entry in selling goods or otherwise replicating individual aspects of Amazon’s business. Over time, efforts by manufacturers or other retailers to compete differently or otherwise alter the terms under which they work together could have a negative effect on Amazon. • General Economic Trends: In comparison with its status during the last recession, e-commerce is now a much more mature business and Amazon a much large player. During the 2008-09 period, the company was a tenth of its present size and e-commerce a relative blip of total retail spending. Consequently, we could envision that a downturn in the overall economy might impact Amazon (and e-commerce more generally) in a more meaningful way if one occurred at this point in time. - 8 - Brian Wieser 212-514-4682 Pivotal Research Group Amazon Income Statement Amazon Income Statement In $mm Except Per Share Data FY15A FY16A FY17A 1Q18A 2Q18A 3Q18A 4Q18E FY18E 1Q19E 2Q19E 3Q19E 4Q19E FY19E 1Q20E 2Q20E 3Q20E 4Q20E FY20E FY21E FY22E FY23E Sales By Segment Online Stores 76,863.0 91,432.0 108,355.0 26,939.0 27,165.0 29,061.0 38,921.3 122,086.3 29,902.3 30,153.2 32,257.7 43,202.6 135,515.8 32,892.5 33,168.5 35,483.5 47,522.9 149,067.4 162,483.4 175,482.1 187,765.9 • Growth ------ ------ 18.5% 18.0% 14.4% 10.1% 10.0% 12.7% 11.0% 11.0% 11.0% 11.0% 11.0% 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 9.0% 8.0% 7.0% Physical Stores 0.0 0.0 5,798.0 4,263.0 4,312.0 4,248.0 4,748.1 17,571.1 4,476.2 4,527.6 4,460.4 4,985.5 18,449.7 4,655.2 4,708.7 4,638.8 5,184.9 19,187.6 19,763.3 20,257.4 20,763.8 • Growth ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ 232.9% 5.0% 203.1% 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 3.0% 2.5% 2.5% Third-Party Seller Services 16,086.0 22,992.0 31,880.0 9,265.0 9,702.0 10,395.0 13,153.8 42,515.8 12,044.5 12,612.6 13,513.5 17,099.9 55,270.5 15,356.7 16,081.1 17,229.7 21,802.3 70,469.9 88,087.3 107,907.0 129,488.4 • Growth ------ ------ 38.7% 43.9% 38.8% 31.1% 25.0% 33.4% 30.0% 30.0% 30.0% 30.0% 30.0% 27.5% 27.5% 27.5% 27.5% 27.5% 25.0% 22.5% 20.0% Subscription Services 4,467.0 6,393.0 9,722.0 3,102.0 3,408.0 3,698.0 4,289.0 14,497.0 4,342.8 4,771.2 5,177.2 6,004.5 20,295.7 5,862.8 6,441.1 6,989.2 8,106.1 27,399.2 35,619.0 44,523.8 53,428.5 • Growth ------ ------ 52.1% 60.0% 57.4% 51.5% 35.0% 49.1% 40.0% 40.0% 40.0% 40.0% 40.0% 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% 30.0% 25.0% 20.0% Retail and Subscription 97,416.0 120,817.0 155,755.0 43,569.0 44,587.0 47,402.0 61,112.1 196,670.1 50,765.7 52,064.6 55,408.8 71,292.6 229,531.7 58,767.2 60,399.4 64,341.2 82,616.3 266,124.1 305,953.0 348,170.2 391,446.5 • Growth ------ 24.0% 28.9% 39.6% 35.5% 24.6% 14.0% 26.3% 16.5% 16.8% 16.9% 16.7% 16.7% 15.8% 16.0% 16.1% 15.9% 15.9% 15.0% 13.8% 12.4% AWS 7,880.0 12,219.0 17,458.0 5,442.0 6,105.0 6,679.0 7,413.9 25,639.9 7,618.8 8,547.0 9,350.6 10,379.4 35,895.8 10,285.4 11,538.5 12,623.3 14,012.2 48,459.3 62,997.1 78,746.4 94,495.7 • Growth 69.7% 55.1% 42.9% 48.6% 48.9% 45.7% 45.0% 46.9% 40.0% 40.0% 40.0% 40.0% 40.0% 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% 30.0% 25.0% 20.0% Other 1,710.0 2,951.0 4,653.0 2,031.0 2,194.0 2,495.0 3,827.6 10,547.6 2,789.2 3,006.6 3,402.8 5,224.1 14,422.6 3,825.1 4,115.7 4,638.9 7,125.6 19,705.3 25,956.3 32,497.1 38,226.6 • Growth ------ ------ 57.7% 138.9% 132.2% 122.2% 120.6% 126.7% 37.3% 37.0% 36.4% 36.5% 36.7% 37.1% 36.9% 36.3% 36.4% 36.6% 31.7% 25.2% 17.6% Total Sales 107,006.0 135,987.0 177,866.0 51,042.0 52,886.0 56,576.0 72,353.6 232,857.6 61,173.7 63,618.2 68,162.2 86,896.1 279,850.1 72,877.7 76,053.5 81,603.5 103,754.0 334,288.7 394,906.4 459,413.7 524,168.7 • Growth ------ 27.1% 30.8% 42.9% 39.3% 29.3% 19.7% 30.9% 19.8% 20.3% 20.5% 20.1% 20.2% 19.1% 19.5% 19.7% 19.4% 19.5% 18.1% 16.3% 14.1% Total Operating Expenses (104,773.0) (131,801.0) (173,760.0) (49,115.0) (49,903.0) (52,852.0) (67,680.1) (219,550.1) (58,384.7) (59,517.6) (63,072.6) (80,634.1) (261,608.9) (68,969.1) (70,524.4) (74,778.4) (95,484.0) (309,755.8) (361,156.0) (415,509.9) (469,611.6) • Non-Stock-Based Expense (102,654.0) (128,826.0) (169,545.0) (47,932.0) (48,435.0) (51,502.0) (66,205.1) (214,074.1) (56,965.1) (57,756.0) (61,452.6) (78,864.1) (255,037.7) (67,336.5) (68,498.5) (72,915.4) (93,448.5) (302,199.0) (352,654.5) (406,158.3) (459,324.8) • Stock-Based Compensation (2,119.0) (2,975.0) (4,215.0) (1,183.0) (1,468.0) (1,350.0) (1,475.0) (5,476.0) (1,419.6) (1,761.6) (1,620.0) (1,770.0) (6,571.2) (1,632.5) (2,025.8) (1,863.0) (2,035.5) (7,556.9) (8,501.5) (9,351.6) (10,286.8) -

Tweaking iPhone Estimates Post Virtual Asia Trip We are adjusting our iPhone estimates post virtual Asia trip. Supply chain check indicates order trend is tracking ok with SE2 being stronger and iPhone 11 recovering gradually. As expected, four models will be launched with 5G in 2H with 1-1.5 months of delay, of which half are planned for 6.1” model with OLED but no LiDAR or triple camera. This seemed a bit aggressive to us, considering there is another 5.4” iPhone 12 supposedly priced cheaper. There is also increasing evidence of Apple taking aggressive effort to control BOM cost to maintain margins given added features while still driving upgrades. We see Apple starting to enlist LGD and BOE as OLED panel suppliers for the aforementioned higher volume 6.1” model, with BOE offers very aggressive pricing of only $55 vs. around $80-100 for Samsung’s panel. Our iPhone units are 3% and 5% lower for Jun-Q and Sep-Q to now 31M and 39M, while Dec-Q is 3% higher at 73M due to shift of iPhone 12 timing by a month.

Risks include ongoing investment in Amazon's infrastructure (both on the AWS and Retail sides of the business), entries into new retail categories where Amazon is less experienced, competition from traditional brick and mortar players, and challenges expanding into newer international markets (such as India). Investment Thesis We remain confident on AMZN's ability to drive penetration of additional retail product categories and key emerging geographies, maintain its lead in cloud computing and execute against additional opportunities such as online advertising (across both endemic and non-endemic advertiser categories), which we believe offer the company compelling growth and profit characteristics.

We believe Prime continued to be key driver in driving revenue for the company. Amazon added more than 4 million Prime members in one week over the holiday season, above 3M that join over the same period last year. We believe Amazon adds at least 5M Prime members/quarter. Amazon doesn't disclose ■ Higher conversion rate. total count, but CIRP's latest estimate points to 90 million members in U.S. alone. Amazon also leads other retailers in terms of conversion rate. According to Hitwise, Amazon enjoyed nearly 7% conversion rate during the holiday season, more than double its closest competitor, and conversion for most retailers were 1-3%. As a result, Hitwise data showed that Amazon accounted for 39% of total visits but over 69% of total transactions. Price (USD) FY 12/31/2016 FY 12/31/2017 FY 12/31/2018 Actual Old New Old New Rev.

Needham & Company, LLC January 30, 2018  Expect continued growth momentum in advertising business. The company’s Other revenue, which is comprised primarily of advertising and credit card revenue grew 58% y/y to $1.1B in 3Q17. We believe the strong growth was driven mainly by its advertising business. For 4Q17, we estimate Other revenue to grow 60% y/y to $1.7B. We estimate Other revenue should reach $6.9B in 2018, representing 50% y/y growth and 3% of total revenue. We believe our estimate could prove conservative as three of world’s largest ad agencies recently indicated to significantly increase spending with Amazon in 2018 (WPP +40-50% y/y, Omnicom +100% y/y, and Publicis +50% y/y). While still a relatively small percentage of total revenue, we believe Advertising revenue could meaningfully lift its N. America segment operating income given its high margin profile.  Profitability upside. We estimate 4Q17 GAAP operating income of $1.55B. at the high end of guidance and above consensus of $1.50B. We estimate non- GAAP operating income of $2.85B, also above consensus of $2.75B. We believe Cloud contributed to most of the upside, although the rapidly increasing advertising revenue could modestly lift the overall margin as well.

The offsets and the expected resilience lead us to maintain our Dec-22 price target of $210. Sources for: Style Exposure –J.P.

Samik Chatterjee, CFA North America Equity Research (1-212) 622 0798 07 April 2022 Risks to Rating and Price Target Industry Downside Risks Deceleration or contraction in the handset and smartphone market could be faster than expected.Economic conditions or shifting consumer demand could cause greater-than-expected deceleration or contraction in the handset and smartphone markets. This would negatively impact Apple’s prospects for growth, and the shares may fail to achieve our price target as a result. Increase in competitive pressures in international markets. Apple is increasingly participating in international markets, such as China and India, where local players, which are better situated, could leverage their position, and pull on levers such as pricing to make the market more competitive. In addition, tariffs enacted by local governments may further hurt Apple’s ability to compete effectively in international markets. Company-Specific Downside Risks Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could be fruitless. Apple has historically invested in new business strategies and acquisitions. As such, success on these investments has low visibility at this time and could lead to greater-than- expected liabilities and expense. Additionally, new investments could have a negative impact on current operations by distracting management. Key man risk around departure of chief executive officer. While risks related to departure of management executives appear considerably lower relative to the past, we believe the execution on strategic priorities under CEO Tim Cook’s leadership still present modest risk to the share price, although we see a strong group of executives to support business performance without disruptions.

Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) and U.K. small-and mid-cap equity research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts’ coverage universe.

(2) Emerging competition; pricing pressure; (3) component pricing volatility and gross margin impacts; (4) Supply chain disruptions; (5) Legal disputes; and (6) Execution missteps.

Stepping back, we think AMZN Tickers AMZN shares can start to work as Retail OI margins improve in calendar 2023 and AWS stabilizes, and at 10.4x 2024 EBITDA we think the risk/reward is favorable here.

If we gross up B2C using a 15% take rate, India would be generating around $19B in GMV (ex-B2B) for the year ended March 2022, and closer to $22B in overall GMV across all businesses.

The average consumer in India spends around $100 annual on purchases, this contrasts with closer to $3,000 in the US and UK and $1,500 for Germany, France and Japan.

B2C is the best proxy for Amazon’s consumer facing business and is growing 32% through March-2022, similar to what we observe in Flipkart’s tax filings (albeit the latter being larger base after consolidating Myntra/Jabong a few years ago). JioMart is likely taking some share from the two larger players owing to its foothold in higher frequency grocery and with an extensive retail brick-and-mortar footprint (Reliance), but fair to say the overall industry was growing in the 30%-35% range through March-2022 and has decelerated a bit since. AMZN’s B2B seems to be rebounding after a few years of regulatory blowback. Recall following the Feb-2019 regulatory changes, Amazon likely deconsolidated or restructured its B2B business in India (B2B is where Amazon would sell products on a wholesale basis into third party sellers, who would subsequently sell these items through Amazon’s website. The company had to wind down ownership in two prominent sellers Cloudtail and Appario, and eliminate exclusives and extensive discounting). AWS India is growing at the fastest growth cadence we’ve observed since 2019, up 65% y/y through March-2022, the biggest positive in this country-update. 15 November 2022 3 Barclays | Amazon.com, Inc.

The country should maintain its growth tailwinds as e-commerce penetration remains low (~8%), and overall retail growth remains high, expected to be 26% in calendar year 2022 (via eMarketer). 15 November 2022 4 Barclays | Amazon.com, Inc. For FY22 (ended 3/22), India grew to 4.4% of Amazon’s International Retail revenue up from 3.5% in FY21. This figure had been north of 5% historically prior to the change in the wholesale business model. India OI has remained around -$1B from FY18-FY22, despite revenue growing 77% in the same period. This implies a roughly 20pt margin improvement, from -33% in FY18 to -14% in FY22. The important take is that India losses appear to be stable, and the recent downtick in international retail operating loss is likely as much a function of reduced margins in the bigger mature markets like UK, DE and JPN, and less so from India turning meaningfully lower. We assume that the mature international markets are facing a lot of the same inflationary pressures as North America retail, especially across DE and UK, two of the profit centers for Amazon International historically.

Overall growth rates should continue to moderate into calendar 2023, reflecting some incremental macro pressure on the consumer but broadly strong trends following the pandemic hyper-growth period. The B2C segment of AMZN’s India business posted 32% y/y ex-FX growth, similar to what we observed from Flipkart over the same period. The Prime offering has helped Amazon build a wide audience in India with 85% of customers and 50% of sellers coming from tier-2 and tier-3 towns. Amazon has stated its goal is to drive $20B of cumulative GMV by 2025 through small sellers in India exporting to buyers across its global marketplace, a nice differentiator vs. some domestic-only competition. The company has recently built out its offering to include logistics both in country and globally, similar to the approach in many of the large Amazon retail geos. AMZN India’s B2B segment rebounded in the recent year ended March ’22 following several years of declines due to the regulatory changes noted above. 15 November 2022 5 Barclays | Amazon.com, Inc.

We would estimate the growth rate may have come down a bit in subsequent months consistent with the economic and pricing pressure Amazon described on its 3Q22 conference call.

Following a weaker April, China May smartphone shipments declined 16% sequentially, 18% below the 3-year average growth of +2% for the month (2017-2019, to exclude the Covid-19 impact in 2020). Monthly units for total handset were down 32% Y/Y, following a 32% Y/Y decline in April and continued the downdraft trend we saw in much of 2020. We recently did a round of channel checks with industry participants in China and highlighted the weak May Day holiday sales with iPhone holding in better on component supply than the Chinese vendors (see our channel checks note IT Hardware: China Smartphone Checks, 6/1/2021). 5G penetration down: 5G penetration sharply declined 520bps in May to 72.6%, a reversal from the steady 5G rise over the last 12 months, where the penetration was only 46% a year ago. Our channel partners have indicated 5G saturation in our recent checks, and this seems to be playing out. 5G phones have represented ~73% of new models introduced YTD in 2021, compared to an average of ~53% for the full year 2020. At 26% of new models introduced YTD, 4G shipments increased by 5% sequentially, but down nearly 65% Y/Y. AAPL Implications 700bps Gain in May Market Share for iPhone: We estimate 3.5M iPhone shipments in the month of May, up 1M vs. April’s seasonally strong 2.5M level. This was up 41% sequentially, vs. normal May seasonal growth level of +55% M/M for 2017-2019. We estimate that iPhone units were up 38% Y/Y in May, a positive reversal vs. a 24% Y/Y decline in April. We also estimate that iPhone market share rose to 16% in the month, 700 bps above the April level of 9%, still a decline from the 20% level seen in Q420, however, an improvement above the 11% level in Q121 and 12% average for 2020. From our conversations with Chinese channel partners, we believe Apple is better positioned to deal with the component shortage issues than the Chinese. Our recent analysis on Taiwan Suppliers also indicated better June-Q for AAPL (AAPL Supplier Tracker - May Sub- Seasonal But Q2 Looks Good, 6/14/2021). The iPhone 12 cycle has been strong. We expect the strong IP12 cycle to benefit the June Q. We have seen this trend before with AAPL, and believe the next two cycles may prove challenging with units potentially down Y/Y in FY22 and FY23. China has been a little different than the global pattern where one strong year is followed by two weak years (see our latest note Smartphone: Q1 Review and Raising 2021 Unit Growth Rate, 5/5/2021). In China, iPhone units have never rebounded from the iPhone 6/6 Plus highs, and in 2020 were 50% below the peak level of 2015. We do not make changes to our estimates for AAPL, and maintain our Equal Weight rating.

Should Get A Bit Easier For AMZN From Here Stock Rating OVERWEIGHT Unchanged The Key Takeaway: We are upbeat on AMZN heading into 1Q results and would add to Industry View POSITIVE positions. There seem to be two buy-side camps forming around the story: those who Unchanged believe that some of 2021’s heavy cost inflation rolls off in 2022 and could see retail Price Target USD 4400.00 margin upside, and those who think the external factors like fuel price and wage Unchanged increases are simply too elevated to manage and that we are in for another disappointing year. As GMV starts to accelerate on a 1-yr basis later in 2Q, we think AMZN shares could Price (18-Apr-2022) USD 3055.70 move higher. At 13x 2023 EBITDA, despite being a consensus long, AMZN remains our Potential Upside/Downside +44.0% preferred name in 2022. Tickers AMZN Cleaning Up 2Q Revenue Estimate: We are bringing our 2Q22 revenue estimate to Market Cap (USD mn) 1553946 reflect the normal Q/Q seasonality for Retail (previously we were simply too high using Shares Outstanding (mn) 508.54 the 2-yr stack, as is consensus). Checks point to overall in-line revenue in 1Q and stable Free Float (%) 90.03 trends heading into 2Q. We haven’t yet heard of any erosion in GMV from the Ukraine- 52 Wk Avg Daily Volume (mn) 3.4 Russia situation, but would expect some to materialize eventually. AMZN tends to gain Dividend Yield (%) N/A market share of e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail when gas prices are elevated Return on Equity TTM (%) 28.81 and the consumer is weakening (as was the case 2008-09) because the value prop of Current BVPS (USD) 271.60 free shipping with Prime increases and consumers are increasingly low-price focused. Source: Bloomberg We expect GMV growth to pick up starting late 2Q and into 2H22, which bodes well for investor enthusiasm. Price Performance Exchange-Nasdaq 52 Week range USD 3773.08-2671.45 Can Margins Go Up in 2022? We think yes. AMZN has doubled fulfilment capacity (+42% CAGR) over the past two years and finally caught up with demand in 4Q21, nearly double the cadence of 2004-2019 (22% CAGR). As the strain on capacity eases into 1H22, we think the overall network will become more efficient, with fewer Covid costs, transportation inefficiencies, extra wage incentives, etc. Despite the wide range of al opinions, we feel more confident in our view that fuel inflation is manageable and only n ter around 5% of last mile fulfilment costs (see: Fuel Cost Inflation ""Manageable"" For AMZN) n I - after seeing the recent FBA increase. Stepping back, AMZN added over $30B+ of Source: IDC; Link to Barclays Live for interactive charting ted incremental high-margin Retail revenue in 2021 (Ads, 3P), yet Retail OI went down $3B ric Y/Y; this shows how much extra cost flowed through and may reverse.

Focus On Tone: The commentary from management is likely the most important thing that could play out on this coming call, and if we were to get continuation of “the sun rising” or related optimism, along with solid 1Q22 results, like last quarter we think shares can trade up. A lot of retail headwinds should abate as we move through the quarters in 2022, both on the revenue acceleration and the margin headwinds easing. We expect this AMZN-specific positive to offset the macro pressure that many in low gross margin e-commerce are likely to see in 2022. AWS Step Down: The 4-5 point tougher comps each of the next two quarters may create some noise around AWS growth rates, but we think fundamentals remain robust, evidenced by the healthy backlog and strong overall cloud market trends. The $1B in server D+A should help boost segment margins similar to 2020. We do worry that the system wide increase in quit-rate (and related cost increase) among tech companies may offset some of the AWS and Retail margin improvements.

Gillis Technology Analyst / Director 646.346.7052 cell: 917.921.8616 BGC Financial L.P. Technology Research Apple Inc. HOLD (AAPL, $123.73, $115 PT) APPLE REVIEW: PREPARE FOR SLOWING GROWTH. PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Haiku: Growth may be harder, for Apple to find over, the next fiscal year. Shares of Apple are down over 7% since the 2015 high of $133.00 reached on February 23, 2015 despite the company supporting its share price vie the repurchase of billions of dollars in stock. This includes $4 billion to repurchase 31.2 million shares in open market transactions in the June quarter, and $90 billion in total share repurchases since the start of the capital return program. While the market is starting to express concerns over Apple’s dependency on the iPhone, and growth in the China market, we mention two other items. 1) Services. Apple makes wonderful hardware and has nicely integrated it with a software operating system. Its other software products and services layer can be considered merely adequate, in our opinion. Does anyone really love using iTunes? Do you truly consider the App store a polished product with curated suggestions that can’t be improved? Have you compared Siri to Google Now? Source: finance.yahoo.com Music may have millions of customers take the free trial, but given the resources that Apple has – isn’t it a bit disappointing to have a product that is similar to others already on the market? Given the excitement over a potential TV bundle, should we expect a break out product given the recent launches? Why can’t Apple build up an advertising revenue stream? And finally, and what point does owning the platform increase the regulatory risk to the company as it uses pricing power and the App store to its own advantage? 2) Growth. We are modeling growth on a year-over-year basis to slow starting in the December quarter of 2016. We are not factoring in revenue from new products that are not announced such as TV, but we are factoring in an iPhone and iPad refresh. While we respect that 73% of the installed base has not upgraded to a 6/6+, and this is going to be driver, the yearly comparison becomes increasingly difficult starting in the December quarter. We do not see that Apple has much room left to increase the ASP of the iPhone, increasing its dependence on growth by driving more units through the channel. Finally, the capital return program has completed $126 billion of the $200 billion plan, and share repurchase activity is slowing as the company spends its domestic cash. The Company reported June quarter revenue of $49.6B. Revenue grew 33% YoY. International sales accounted for 59% of total revenue in the June quarter. Apple returned over $13B to its shareholders in the quarter. iPhone: The company sold 48M (+35% YoY) units in the quarter. iPad: The Company sold 11M (-18% YoY) Macintosh: Apple sold 5M (+9% YoY) Macs during the quarter. Geographical Breakdown: The Company derived 20B (+15% YoY, 41% of total Company Data revenue) from Americas., 10B from Europe (+19% YoY, 21% of total revenue), 13B Price ($) 123.73 from Greater China (+112% YoY, 27% of revenue), 3B (+9% YoY, 6% of total 52-Week Range ($) 93.28–134.54 revenue) and 3B from Asia Pacific (+26% YoY, 6% of total revenue) Mkt Cap ($ B) 754.80 Company guidance for the 2015 fourth quarter is $49B-$51B in revenue, gross margin of 38.5-39.5%, tax rate to be 26.3%, and operating expense of $5.85-$5.95B. Price Target ($) 115 Diluted Shares Out (M) 5773 Balance Sheet: AAPL has $203B in cash ($35.14/ share) and $47B long-term debt as of June 27, 2015. The company generated $15B in cash from operations.

Gillis Technology Analyst / Director 646.346.7052 cell: 917.921.8616 BGC Financial L.P. Risks Economic conditions: Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment, tighter credit, negative financial news and decline in income/asset values. This could adversely affect the performance and operations of the company. Competition: There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile communication devices, personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPL’s operating results could be affected badly in case it is not able to compete in such adverse market conditions. Inventory and Other Asset Risk: Product obsolescence is rapid in global personal computers and mobile market can lead to additional incurrence of inventory and asset related charges which could have a material impact on the company’s finances. Key Components: AAPL procures its key components including microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs from single or limited sources. This exposes the company to significant pricing and supply risks. Dependence on Third Parties Outside the US: AAPL relies on third-party manufacturers for not just most of its products but also for its transportation and logistics management. This reduces the company’s direct control over production and distribution and also leads to uncertainty. For additional risks, see the AAPL 10-K filing with the SEC.

HOLD (AMZN, $735.59, $750 PT) AMAZON EARNINGS PREVIEW: “YOUR PROFIT IS MY OPPORTUNITY” PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Haiku: The margin profile, for Amazon services, may compress in time. Amazon shares may continue a pattern of volatility on earnings results, as investors expect the company to report its most profitable June quarter in company history, although we still expect net income margins to be a mere 1.7%. Shares have traded anywhere from 6% to 14% on earnings, with the stock trading up 4 of the last eight quarters. Valuation: We mention that if we take our 2017 revenue estimate of $158 billion, and generously apply a 10% margin, followed by a 25% tax rate (also generous), and divide by the 487 million shares we estimate, this is $24.33 in EPS. Using a stock price of $735/share, that EPS gives a 30x multiple for a company that is growing revenue 16% YoY . The point of this exercise is to show that even if the company was able to obtain a 10% overall margin profile, one could view that Source: Nasdaq.com the valuation is already reflected at current share price levels. Amazon Web Service: Regarding AWS, our estimates are revenue of $2.7B with margin of 28%, revenue growth of 50% YoY and 9% of total revenue. We see risks to growth slowing and profitability being reduced via a combination of competition, price cuts and overall service commoditization. If one were to assign the value of Walmart to Amazon’s retail operations, approximately $228B, that would leave $119B in value for Amazon’s remaining businesses, which are primarily AWS. While we respect the growth and margin profile of AWS, it is subject to commoditization risk and a valuation of over $100 billion at its current level seems more than reasonable. CEO Jeff Bezos is reported to have used the line “Your profit is my opportunity”, and we mention that AWS competition may seek to flip this around on Mr. Bezos by using price as a lever to win business. We estimate revenue for the June quarter to be $29.2B, which is growth of 26% YoY and 0.2% sequentially. This compares to the consensus estimate of 29.6B. Our earnings per share estimate of $1.05 compares to $0.19 in the prior year and $1.07 in the prior quarter. Consensus is $1.11. North America: We expect revenue from the North America segment to be at $17.0B in the quarter for 58% of total, +24% YoY growth and segment operating income of $869M. We expect Media to grow in North America at +24% YoY for 19% of North American revenue and EGM (electronics and other general merchandise) revenue to grow at 23% YoY, accounting for 80% of North American revenue. International: We expect revenue from International segment to be $9.4B in the quarter with a growth of 24% YoY. We expect Media revenue to grow 21% YoY to provide 27% of total, and EGM to grow at 25% YoY providing 72% of International revenue. Media & EGM: We expect worldwide Media revenue to grow 23% YoY to $6B for 20% of total Company Data revenue. EGM revenue estimated at $20B, +24% YoY growth. This segment is the growth engine Price ($) 735.59 for the company and expected to account for 70% of total revenue. 52-Week Range ($) 451.00-757.34 Guidance-Q216: GAAP operating income in Q216 is a range from $375 million to $975 million. Mkt Cap ($B) 347.07 Revenue guidance is net sales between $28.0B and $30.5B (+21% to +32% YoY Growth). Price Target ($) 750 Balance Sheet and Estimates. AMZN has $16B in cash ($32.97/share) and long-term debt of Shares Outstanding (M) 481 $8B as of March 31, 2016. Cash flow from operations was a negative $2B during the quarter.

Risks Competition: Amazon faces competition from various industries like retail, e-commerce services, digital and web services. These competitors have longer histories, greater resources and brand recognition and more customers, and are capable of adopting aggressive pricing, securing better terms from vendors and employing more resources for technology, fulfillment and marketing. Expansion: The company is witnessing significant expansion in its global operations which has increased the complexity of the business. This expansion also leads to strain on management, growth, financial, operational and other resources and also subjects the company to additional legal, financial and business risks. Fulfillment Centers: It is very important for the company to predict customer demand and optimize and operate its fulfillment centers successfully, otherwise it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity, increased costs and impairment charges. This could harm the business. Seasonality: The seasonal nature of the business puts a strain on the operations of the company.

Foreign Exchange Risk: The company has significant foreign exchange risk associated with its international websites, which affects operating results. Further expansion in international operations increases exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. For additional risks, see the AMZN 10-K filing with the SEC.
