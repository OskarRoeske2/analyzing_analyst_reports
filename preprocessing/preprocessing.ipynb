      "capable of adopting aggressive pricing, securing better terms from vendors and employing more resources for \n",
      "technology, fulfillment and marketing. \n",
      "Expansion: The company is witnessing significant expansion in its global operations which has increased the complexity \n",
      "of the business. This expansion also leads to strain on management, growth, financial, operational and other resources \n",
      "and also subjects the company to additional legal, financial and business risks. \n",

      "fulfillment centers successfully, otherwise it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity, \n",
      "increased costs and impairment charges. This could harm the business. \n",
      "Seasonality: The seasonal nature of the business puts a strain on the operations of the company. Net sales in the \n",
      "fourth quarter is disproportionate which leads to inventory, gross profits, net shipping costs and accounts payable being \n",
      "adversely affected. \n",
      "Foreign Exchange Risk: The company has significant foreign exchange risk associated with its international websites, \n",

      "Sentence 2: We Think the Street – Buy- and Sell-side are September 30, 2020 Looking at SOTP Wrong (Us Included).\n",
      "Sentence 3: We are Reframing Why AMZN is the Best Mega-cap on a Multi-year Basis.\n",
      "Sentence 4: BOTTOM LINE:\n",
      "Sentence 5: We and almost every other investor we have spoken to over the years, has been MICHAEL LEVINE framing the AMZN SOTP valuation wrong.\n",
      "Sentence 6: Amazon advertising is only ~5% of revenues, but is far greater 212-514-4682 contributor to overall non-AWS EBIT margins than the street recognizes.\n",
      "Sentence 7: Said differently, If advertising was viewed as a stand-along business unit (we will explain why it shouldn’t be), it would represent well north of 300% of 2020E non-AWS EBIT.\n",
      "Sentence 8: Amazon (AMZN) Based on our view that there is massive upside by 2024E, we increase our PT to a Street high of $4,500 based on an average of our 2024 SOTP and 30x our 2024 EBIT “power” of $91bn vs. our in-print RATING: BUY estimates of $71.5bn and the street at $69bn- both of these are modeled back at 10%, Overall, we think (Previous: BUY) investors are materially underestimating the earnings power of the business.\n",
      "Sentence 9: We are going to be good bulls (not all our colleagues always are) and not factor all of the goodness in our estimates.\n",
      "Sentence 10: We wanted Target Price: $4,500 to frame a highly likely outcome, as well as dynamics of the AMZN business that we this not totally (Previous: $3,925) appreciated.\n",
      "Sentence 11: As a long time buy-sider, I think one of the most important values the sell-side can bring is reframing an underappreciated dynamic.\n",
      "Sentence 12: We don’t think we are going to disappoint.\n",
      "Sentence 13: Price (9/30/20): $3,148.73 We would highlight that this is not a short-term call.\n",
      "Sentence 14: We do think Street estimates for fulfillment in particular are modeled too low in H121 based on the company’s message that they are embarking on another fulfillment center investment cycle – made loud and clear in our view on the 2Q20 call.\n",
      "Sentence 15: Also, we all know eCommerce has seen a massive acceleration from the pandemic, but can imagine guiding could be challenging.\n",
      "Sentence 16: Long term, we would bet that over a 4-year period a Long AMZN / Short the market MARKET DATA position will be handsomely rewarded.\n",
      "Sentence 17: 52\n",
      "Sentence 18: Wk Hi - Low $3,344 - 1,626 Market Cap.\n",
      "Sentence 19: (MM) $1.52tn There are a few observations we wanted to highlight: Avg. Daily Vol (000) 2.5 \n",
      "Sentence 20: Everybody who is using a SOTP model for AMZN is doing so incorrectly (ourselves too).\n",
      "Sentence 21: We also are not huge fan of SOTP models because the Buy-side or Sell-side makes inaccurate EPS 2020E Prior 2021E\n",
      "Sentence 22: Prior conclusions, but in AMZN’s case think is necessary.\n",
      "Sentence 23: Why we are not a fan: 1Q 5.09 5.09 9.18 6.76 \n",
      "Sentence 24: These SOTP analyses are often done as means to justify that a company is worth more than it is currently trading at, but let us be clear.\n",
      "Sentence 25: Analysts may lie – the market 2Q 10.49 2.26 13.02 10.75 doesn’t lie - and the associated price a stock currently trades at is what it is.\n",
      "Sentence 26: It can 3Q 7.96 2.93 13.24 10.71 turn out to be true, taking the case of Icahn’s successful push to separate PYPL from EBAY.\n",
      "Sentence 27: We would argue there are a lot more reasons that untethered from EBAY, 4Q 9.6 4.82 17.33 12.45 PYPL has been able to transform into a different business than it would if still owned by EBAY.\n",
      "Sentence 28: But back to our initial point, analysts may lie – stocks don’t lie.\n",
      "Sentence 29: Massive FY 33.1 15.10 40.67 40.67 kudos to whomever bet alongside Mr. Icahn, but this has been a grand slam home run, with PYPL alone at a 230bn mkt cap.\n",
      "Sentence 30:  We do not remotely subscribe to the thesis that AWS profits – highly profitable and P/E 163x 60.8x quantifiable – are being used to “subsidize” retail losses.\n",
      "Sentence 31: Sales 2020E Prior 2021E\n",
      "Sentence 32: Prior  SOTP debates aside, we would all concur that more disclosure is better than less disclosure.\n",
      "Sentence 33: 1Q 75.5 75.5 94.4 90.9\n",
      "Sentence 34: This typically leads to multiple expansion given investors greater understanding of the different moving pieces of complex businesses.\n",
      "Sentence 35: Examples we would cite are BABA (cloud and offline 2Q 88.9 80.9 99.6 95.3 have been huge drags on a highly profitable core business), NFLX (domestic is highly 3Q 92.8 87.8 108.9 103.7 profitable vs international), and GOOG most recently took a cue from some of these other mega-caps.\n",
      "Sentence 36: Ironically, AMZN over the last few years has gone from the mega-cap disclosing 4Q 115.8 111.1 135.8 128.9 the least to the one disclosing the most.\n",
      "Sentence 37: FY 355.3 355.3 438.8 418.8 \n",
      "Sentence 38: Now let’s chitty chat AMZN.\n",
      "Sentence 39: We think the street often tries to ascribe different multiples to AWS (they certainly should), advertising, subscription, FBA, GMV, 1p revs, 3p revs etc.\n",
      "Sentence 40: You name it, BALANCE SHEET DATA (6/30/20) somebody has done it.\n",
      "Sentence 41: The only reported FACTS we have about OI is AWS, Domestic and International so all the other assumptions are being made by the Street.\n",
      "Sentence 42: Cash ($) $71.4bn We have historically modeled for our SOTP: 1) Domestic and 2) International GMV (we gross Debt ($) $75bn up the 3rd party GMV and admittedly are making an assumption on the take rate, as it likely has Debt/Equity 0.98x only continued to uptick given FBA growth), 3) AWS, 4) Advertising, and then have applied a “holding company discount”.\n",
      "Sentence 43: Book Value/Share $123 Source: Pivotal Research Group and Company We believe you could nitpick our approach to international GMV.\n",
      "Sentence 44: That said, we believe:\n",
      "Sentence 45: Documents 1) The company remains in aggressive investment mode – particularly in India – and suspect this market alone is a large % of the international losses Important Disclosures Are Located In The Appendix 2) Based on our channel work, we are of the view that most of the Western European markets are doing MSD % OI margins 3) Unlike China, which was a guaranteed unwinnable fight for AMZN relative to Chinese natives like JD, and BABA, there was a zero-probability chance the Chinese government would allow ecommerce to be dominated by a foreign player.\n",
      "Sentence 46: 4) By comparison, we think the Indian government is way more foreign business friendly, and valuing the company on retail OI (god knows how many assumptions you need to make to come up w a clean retail OI number) would attribute no value to international revenues.\n",
      "Sentence 47:  We would advocate the investors should essentially look at the business in two primary buckets:\n",
      "Sentence 48: AWS and Everything Else \n",
      "Sentence 49: So why do we think so?\n",
      "Sentence 50: AMZN is probably the company that penned the term “Flywheel” or certainly made it pervasive in the investment and operating communities.\n",
      "Sentence 51: What do we mean?\n",
      "Sentence 52: Let’s start to dissect by reporting line.\n",
      "Sentence 53:  Retail -\n",
      "Sentence 54: The 1p and 3p businesses, while with different margin structures – 3p is much higher and reported only as the net take, are intimately intertwined.\n",
      "Sentence 55: They benefit from the same end-customer base.\n",
      "Sentence 56: With FBA’s continued expansion and penetration as a % of the 3P business, they often share the same warehouse space, as well as the same logistics/delivery providers.\n",
      "Sentence 57: They share the same payment processing and benefit from the same marketing.\n",
      "Sentence 58: We have long put zero stock in trying to look at one vs. the other.\n",
      "Sentence 59: FBA increasing as % of the mix is good for retail margins and AMZN’s take rate, but to our SOTP comment, we are not going to try and put a different multiple on one vs. the other.\n",
      "Sentence 60:  Subscription – Prime – Sweet Sweet AMZN Prime.\n",
      "Sentence 61: While we get that investors love subscription businesses because they are sticky, recurring, and have much greater degrees of predictability, AMZN Prime is all about the flywheel.\n",
      "Sentence 62: There may be a small base of Audible users or more on the come with its recent Luna Cloud gaming service announcement, but end of the day the subscription business at 19.2bn in 2019 is all about Prime.\n",
      "Sentence 63: Back to our Flywheel comment, the Prime business exists because of the robust selection, and value proposition it represents to end consumers.\n",
      "Sentence 64: And to further sweeten the deal, AMZN over the last 5-7 years has only further increased the value of a prime subscription by including an increasingly robust offering of streaming video, streaming audio and most recently, 1-day shipping.\n",
      "Sentence 65: On the other side of the “network effect”, the larger the Prime subscriber base, the more enfranchised sellers are in participating in AMZN’s FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) program.\n",
      "Sentence 66: Having the “Prime Enabled” logo next to your item, is a key driver to a shopper’s propensity to click.\n",
      "Sentence 67: So back to our comments about Retail, Prime and Retail are intimately intertwined.\n",
      "Sentence 68: Within that context, we think ascribing a value to Subscription in SOTP separately also makes no sense \n",
      "Sentence 69: Advertising – As we have framed in our earlier notes about AMZN’s ad business, 1) We think they are the only online player really benefiting from trade budgets today, 2) We believe there was an evolution internally in which AMZN found the right advertising business for AMZN.\n",
      "Sentence 70:  We estimate at least 85-90% of the AMZN business today is sponsored listings.\n",
      "Sentence 71: In this scenario, an advertiser pays for higher placement within the product sort order, the user stays on AMZN, and AMZN keeps the transaction and transaction data.\n",
      "Sentence 72: To use CPG as an example (we think by far the largest advertiser vertical on AMZN), we think P&G, Unilever, Energizer - companies that don’t have a real DTC strategy -view advertising on AMZN to be not so different than paying for favorable shelf placement at WMT, TGT, KR, etc.\n",
      "Sentence 73: The reality is, this is a) where their customers are, b) has better quantifiable results than the offline analog, so have been happy participants.\n",
      "Sentence 74:  We think that AMZN could become more aggressive with AMZN Fire/potentially giving the TV device away to further drive their video inventory, but think that this hasn’t happened yet (but who knows – prime day is around the bend), but a development worth closely watching.\n",
      "Sentence 75:  Similar to Retail and Prime, we think investors have potentially thought through the Ad business as being a separate business unit, but we think that it sits under the broader retail umbrella to a greater degree than investors recognize.\n",
      "Sentence 76: The ad business doesn’t exist without retail.\n",
      "Sentence 77: So why does this all matter?\n",
      "Sentence 78: Let’s do a little fun math.\n",
      "Sentence 79: 1) FY 2015 North America margin was 4.3%, international was (0.3%) 2) The FY 2015 Other revenue line in totality was $1.7bn (with advertising likely $1.2-1.3bn), 3) Street estimated GAAP EBIT is ~$69bn for 2024 \n",
      "Sentence 80: In our view, 2016 was the year advertising had the real break out - with Other revenues growing 74% y/y and advertising growing, we estimate, ~90% y/y. \n",
      "Sentence 81: For context, our estimate of advertising was $13.8bn in 2019, growing 41% y/y to ~19.4bn in 2020.\n",
      "Sentence 82: Now this is where it gets interesting – based on our channel work, and some common sense, we estimate that advertising EBIT margins (if it were a stand- alone) are north of 80%, and believe that could even be CONSERVATIVE.\n",
      "Sentence 83:  Running this math based on 2019 actuals, Non-AWS EBIT was $5.3bn, and Advertising if looked in isolation would be ~$11bn – implying that the rest of the business is losing money??!?!?!?!?!\n",
      "Sentence 84: We actually think of this as a huge positive not a negative.\n",
      "Sentence 85: As we stated under bullet 4, we think that there is AWS and Everything Else so we look at advertising as another part of the Flywheel.\n",
      "Sentence 86:  Valuation is often more of an art-form than pure science, but end of the day what matters is what is the underlying earnings potential of the business.\n",
      "Sentence 87: In our view, we think the key exercise for valuing AMZN, is to do is the following:  Take AWS Revenues and EBIT estimates for 2024 (newly published today) – we are at ~$100bn in revenues and $34.5bn in OI  Assume the “stand-alone” advertising business does $52bn and an estimated margin of 75% (let’s assume they do more around CTV/Fire TV so the margin goes down from predominantly sponsored products, that is $39bn!\n",
      "Sentence 88: So combined, between these two lines, we are already at $73.5bn in EBIT \n",
      "Sentence 89: If we assume that the non-ad components of the north American retail biz are able to get back to a 4% EBIT margin as they were in 2015 (North America was 4.3%), we would get on our estimates of retail revenues of 19.5bn  All in, this is $93bn of EBIT “Earnings Power” vs the street at $69bn – 14% EBIT margins vs the street at ~10% \n",
      "Sentence 90: Assuming we are correct, by 2024 investors won’t need to do these financial acrobatics, because the underlying report EBIT of the busines will show up flowing through the income statement.\n",
      "Sentence 91:  Let’s entertain the negative side and see where we could be wrong.\n",
      "Sentence 92: Do you mean to say AMZN is back to its old days of selling things at a loss?\n",
      "Sentence 93: And don’t they always find a way to keep spending?\n",
      "Sentence 94: Well yes and no.\n",
      "Sentence 95: We think this comparison to 2015 margins is a decent proxy to think through earnings power, and are expect international EBIT will be positive by then as well.\n",
      "Sentence 96: We do see a few big step function potential costs that are worth framing, and want to discuss where our logic could be wrong.\n",
      "Sentence 97:  There has been a huge amount of incremental investment into the business with fulfillment having slowed in 19/18 in terms of order of magnitude y/y dollar growth pretty substantially – we think there is a massive step up this year \n",
      "Sentence 98: Content costs – a straight up gross margin headwind have increased substantially and potentially could again \n",
      "Sentence 99: We actually think a more logical owner of things like NFL rights at the next round of negotiations is more likely to be AMZN, AAPL or GOOG relative to the current rights holders as we suspect we have hit a negative inflection point with linear viewing/cable subscribers.\n",
      "Sentence 100: We also think that the potential for one of these tech companies, who each have MASSIVE international audiences to have a big impact on the league’s international presence and brand would likely only further drive this – this would be a huge step up in content costs \n",
      "Sentence 101: One day shipping evolves into same day shipping – as we have been writing about since initiating on AMZN last year, we have viewed one day shipping as a step along the road on the way to inevitable same day shipping – a clear incremental driver of incremental cost headwinds.\n",
      "Sentence 102: The grocery category is clearly one of the last uncaptured categories of huge TAM- particularly in the US.\n",
      "Sentence 103: We think that the elements of fresh product, different fulfillment center needs (in part because of perishable), are subscale at this point.\n",
      "Sentence 104: But would highlight that 1) we think Bezos’ world view is that he wants AMZN to own as large a percent of the consumers wallet as possible – if they dominate in grocery, they will have largely achieved that, 2) groceries are arguably to last category within which AMZN is not dominant, so see fewer negative new category introduction headwinds and 3) we are assuming AMZN can ultimately get to a ~3-4% EBIT margin in grocery at scale.\n",
      "Sentence 105:  Logistics?\n",
      "Sentence 106: – we have been of the view for several years, that AMZN has ambitions to compete with FDX/UPS in the top US cities/where they have the most density.\n",
      "Sentence 107: We think investors have been paying for some of these investments “along the way”, and think that AMZN has pulled back mid-Covid from their intentions to compete with the third-party carriers, but think this is a function of necessity given the incredible high level of demand for all eCommerce companies.\n",
      "Sentence 108: We would be shocked if AMZN is not in market well in advance of 2024 – pricing below their peers.\n",
      "Sentence 109: Overall, we think this competitive push would be a headwind to EBIT, but would be favorably viewed as a new leg of the AMZN story.\n",
      "Sentence 110: The ad business is more mature than we appreciate.\n",
      "Sentence 111: We think that the ad biz grows correlated with GMV and while we have estimated GMV growth of 13% in 2024, and ad growth at 20%, potentially we are overestimating the headroom in the business.\n",
      "Sentence 112: In summary, we think that most of these potential large pockets of investment (ex-fulfillment build-out) would likely be seen as incremental drivers of revenue growth, so to the extent EBIT numbers are too high, we would suspect the revenue numbers are likely too low.\n",
      "Sentence 113:  AMZN long-term skeptics will respond to an analysis such as this that they always manage to spend away the upside, but if grocery is in fact the last “frontier” category, we think they will ultimately run out of large incremental “big ticket” investment opportunities and the underlying earnings power of the business will flow through.\n",
      "Sentence 114: WHERE WE COULD BE WRONG: 1) AWS continues to slow faster than we expect, 2) 3rd party fees at 26.7% for 2018 (we model their exit run rate for Q4 at 27.3%) see material pressure.\n",
      "Sentence 115: AMZN began reducing some fees over the last 2 months - we are nervous that they could actually be way too high, but don’t know how to handicap magnitude, 3) offline retail is able to strike back harder than we appreciate – we are surprised WMT already had its wheels in motion in terms of a response 4) we are underestimating the size of the investment cycle.\n",
      "Sentence 116: Incremental investment for one-day is impacting shipping costs – if they really want to get this right, it could be a material investment in fulfillment too.\n",
      "Sentence 117: RISKS: 1) Over saturation of AMZN within eCommerce, 2) macro-economic deceleration causes greater than expected declines in commerce, 3) AWS slows materially, and 4) anti-trust action.\n",
      "Sentence 118: Appendix: Important Disclosures Analyst Certification I, Michael Levine, hereby certify that the views expressed in this research report accurately reflect my personal views about the subject company and their securities.\n",
