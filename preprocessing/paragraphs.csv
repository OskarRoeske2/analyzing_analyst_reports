Overall, we estimate Q2 GMV to be $79.7B, increasing 30% y/y.

Revenue from iPhone unit sales grew at an even slower pace at 10% YoY, as customers opted for older models at lower prices. Average selling price declined $35 sequentially and $76 from the December quarter. ASPs of $561 are still materially above the expected industry average of $314 in 2014 according to IDC. While Apple is currently enjoying success selling its old model phones into emerging markets, one has to question the long term viability as competition becomes more aggressive in the mid and entry markets, offering consumers current model phones at similar or lower price points, and with a willingness to capture less gross margin. The mix shift to the older model Apple phones resulted in gross margins of 39.4%, above the company guidance of 37-38%, and 250 basis points above the prior year June quarter. We expect the favorable gross margin trends to reverse starting in the current quarter as the next generation iPhone should have a lower margin profile particularly if the phone has a sapphire screen.', 'iPad. The company saw its second consecutive quarter of decline in iPad units sold on a YoY basis. Unit sales at 13.3 million were approximately half of the December quarter unit sales. While investors have largely glossed over the decline in iPad revenue, we mention it is a distinct possibility that Apple may experience declines in iPhone unit sales after the next upgrade cycle, if consumers lengthen the life span for smartphones as core features such as LTE, fingerprint scanning, and larger screens have the potential to satiate the typical customer. Our estimates for the coming upgrade cycle include some larger numbers such as 59.5 million phones in the December quarter, a number that may be hard to eclipse in the December 2015 quarterly results.', 'Channel inventory. We estimate that iPhone channel inventory was kept near record levels at 15.25 million units, a small decline of 150k units from the March quarter. We also mention that while the company disclosed the change in channel inventory, it stopped providing the absolute number. For comparison, the company reduced channel inventory by 600K units in the prior year June quarter to 11 million units. The growth of channel inventory at 39% YoY meaningfully outpaces the unit sales volume of 10% YoY. Using 13 weeks in the quarter, and based on the 35.203 million units sold in the quarter (a pace of 2.7 million units per week), we note that 15.25 million units in the channel represents approximately 5.5 weeks on inventory.

With a market capitalization of $282 billion, our take is that the AWS business is priced in to stock. It is possible that risks to the margin of the AWS business may appear over time if services become commoditized.

We expect Prime Day to continue driving hundreds of thousands of new members as in previous years. CIRP further highlights that Amazon Prime members on average spend $1300 annually vs. $700 by non-member customers. We believe Amazon finds Prime members more readily renew and are easier to retain.

Looking at Apple’s share performance chart over the last two years, we mention that the other time that Apple has traded above the $100 mark was in September 2012. This raises the question, is the company poised to break out to new life time highs, or could shares be negatively impacted by overheated expectations and a slowing market for iPads?', 'While we remain concerned on the iPhone’s shrinking market share, which was just 11.7% worldwide in the June quarter according to IDC (Android was 84.7%), we are positive on the burgeoning service layer that the company is growing. This includes Apple Pay, iBeacons, and improvements to iAds in iOS8 that allows for retargeting consumers. While we still see iAd as a faltering business, the potential when connected with iBeacons and Apple Pay is impressive. We would like to see the company build a robust subscription streaming music (Beats) and video offering to complement its other products.', 'iPhone : We expect the company reverses the rather steep recent decline in average selling price given the product refresh and the addition of the premium priced iPhone 6+ to the product mix. We estimate 38.5M units sold at an ASP of $600 representing 56.7% of revenue. Unit volumes are growth of 13.9% YoY and 9.4% sequentially. While the iPhone is an impressive revenue and profit driver for the company, unit volume growth remains materially below the broader market which posted growth of 25.3% in the June quarter according to IDC. Our HOLD rating is driven in part by concern that the upgrade cycle for premium smartphones may elongate as the current iPhone provides the core needs for most users (fast connection speeds, biometric identification, larger screens). Faster and thinner may prove to be a less compelling reason to upgrade going forward. In our view, we are already seeing an elongation in the iPad refresh cycle. We expect the upgrade cycle for phones could also be stretched out by carrier reluctance to continue to subsidize handsets. We are currently modeling 59.5 million iPhones in the December quarter with an ASP of $655. This represents unit growth of 17% above the prior record for the company. Apple remains particularly vulnerable to posting record smashing results but having the outcome viewed as a disappointment due to overheated expectations.', 'iWatch.

Market Cap (m)', 'Apple’s guidance for the December quarter indicates growth in revenue and EPS, even at the low end of the range. That growth might be low single-digits, but it’s growth nonetheless for a stock that is discounting a fear of revenue and EPS declines. CEO Tim Cook also indicated that iPhone units would grow, which should be welcome news to investors after recent soft commentary from US wireless operators about upgrade rates.', 'While there are plenty of adjustments within our financial model, we continue to expect Apple to generate $10 in EPS in Fiscal 2016, reflecting 8% EPS growth, thanks to the continued aggressive share repurchase. This may be a slowdown from the 43% growth in Fiscal 2015, but we believe it should be enough to deserve a 16.0x P/E multiple and $160 price target for Apple, given the strong free cash flow conversion.', 'Over the past week, the commentary from US operators about declining phone upgrade rates was starting to concern us, but apparently China continues to chug along unabated, with mainland units growing 120% during the quarter. As we learn more about phone upgrade programs, we agree with management’s assessment that the benefit might actually be larger in future years than what they are seeing now. We also think there is an opportunity for Apple to expand its own upgrade program internationally, which could further accelerate replacement rates.', 'We maintained our estimate of 80 million iPhone units sold in the December quarter, recognizing that the US might not be as strong as we first thought. We took down our March estimate to 62.5 million units from 66 million in recognition of the potential impact of launching the iPhone into 50 markets earlier than we expected. Our new estimate reflects 2.2% unit growth in the March quarter and 5% growth for the year. We maintain our estimate of 4% ASP erosion in Fiscal 2016 as it seems implausible that Apple can continue the 5 consecutive quarters of annual iPhone ASP growth. The net impact is for slight growth in revenue for iPhones in 2016.', 'iPads continue to disappoint, declining y/y for the seventh consecutive quarter. However, the ASP outlook is improved based on the current quarter’s results and the launch of the iPad Pro. As a result, our estimate for a decline in iPad revenue was cut in half to -5% from -10% in Fiscal 2016.', 'There are several factors that have led us to increase our services revenue by $1.7 billion for Fiscal 2016. The proliferation of Apple products globally from new and used purchases is leveraging the launch of Apple Music and obvious traction in Apple Pay, which got an added boost from a new deal with American Express for international use. Our new expectation of 10% growth is in-line with the growth rate Apple delivered in Fiscal Q4 and all of Fiscal 2015, yet the dynamics for accelerating growth are clearly present.', 'While Apple does not report Apple Watch revenue or units, we estimate it sold 3.5 million in the quarter, generating $1.5 billion in revenue. We cut our Fiscal 2016 Apple Watch unit estimate by 15 million, to 35 million, resulting in a $6.3 billion negative impact to our Fiscal 2016 estimate. Those cuts were offset partially by higher revenue estimates for AppleTV and iPod refresh.', 'There is no change to our overall operating margins as a slight increase in our gross margin estimate was offset by slight increases in R&D and SG&A. Higher other income and a 30 basis point reduction in our estimated tax rate helped offset some of the operating reductions detailed above.', 'Apple bought back $13.3 billion of stock during the quarter versus our estimate of $12.5 billion. The purchases were also completed at an effective price of $109 versus our $130 estimate at the start of the quarter, resulting in 26 million more shares purchased than we estimated.

While the market is starting to express concerns over Apple’s dependency on the iPhone, and growth in the China market, we mention two other items.', '1) Services. Apple makes wonderful hardware and has nicely integrated it with a software operating system. Its other software products and services layer can be considered merely adequate, in our opinion. Does anyone really love using iTunes? Do you truly consider the App store a polished product with curated suggestions that can’t be improved? Have you compared Siri to Google Now? Music may have millions of customers take the free trial, but given the resources that Apple has – isn’t it a bit disappointing to have a product that is similar to others already on the market? Given the excitement over a potential TV bundle, should we expect a break out product given the recent launches? Why can’t Apple build up an advertising revenue stream? And finally, and what point does owning the platform increase the regulatory risk to the company as it uses pricing power and the App store to its own advantage? 2) Growth. We are modeling growth on a year-over-year basis to slow starting in the December quarter of 2016. We are not factoring in revenue from new products that are not announced such as TV, but we are factoring in an iPhone and iPad refresh. While we respect that 73% of the installed base has not upgraded to a 6/6+, and this is going to be driver, the yearly comparison becomes increasingly difficult starting in the December quarter. We do not see that Apple has much room left to increase the ASP of the iPhone, increasing its dependence on growth by driving more units through the channel. Finally, the capital return program has completed $126 billion of the $200 billion plan, and share repurchase activity is slowing as the company spends its domestic cash.', 'The Company reported June quarter revenue of $49.6B.

Shares have traded anywhere from 6% to 14% on earnings, with the stock trading up 4 of the last eight quarters.', 'We mention that if we take our 2017 revenue estimate of $158 billion, and generously apply a 10% margin, followed by a 25% tax rate (also generous), and divide by the 487 million shares we estimate, this is $24.33 in EPS. Using a stock price of $735/share, that EPS gives a 30x multiple for a company that is growing revenue 16% YoY . The point of this exercise is to show that even if the company was able to obtain a 10% overall margin profile, one could view that the valuation is already reflected at current share price levels.', 'Regarding AWS, our estimates are revenue of $2.7B with margin of 28%, revenue growth of 50% YoY and 9% of total revenue. We see risks to growth slowing and profitability being reduced via a combination of competition, price cuts and overall service commoditization. If one were to assign the value of Walmart to Amazon’s retail operations, approximately $228B, that would leave $119B in value for Amazon’s remaining businesses, which are primarily AWS. While we respect the growth and margin profile of AWS, it is subject to commoditization risk and a valuation of over $100 billion at its current level seems more than reasonable.
