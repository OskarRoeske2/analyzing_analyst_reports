0,1,20201001_Pivotal_Research_Group_AMZN_AMZN-_We_Think_the_Street_Buy_and_Sell_side_are_Lo.pdf,2020-10-01,Pivotal Research Group,AMZN,Amazon.com Inc.,Consumer Discretionary,"['BOTTOM LINE: We and almost every other investor we have spoken to over the years, has been framing the AMZN SOTP valuation wrong. Amazon advertising is only ~5% of revenues, but is far greater contributor to overall non-AWS EBIT margins than the street recognizes. Said differently, If advertising was viewed as a stand-along business unit (we will explain why it shouldn’t be), it would represent well north of 300% of 2020E non-AWS EBIT.', 'Based on our view that there is massive upside by 2024E, we increase our PT to a Street high of $4,500 based on an average of our 2024 SOTP and 30x our 2024 EBIT “power” of $91bn vs. our in-print estimates of $71.5bn and the street at $69bn- both of these are modeled back at 10%, Overall, we think (Previous: BUY) investors are materially underestimating the earnings power of the business. We are going to be good bulls (not all our colleagues always are) and not factor all of the goodness in our estimates. We wanted to frame a highly likely outcome, as well as dynamics of the AMZN business that we this not totally (Previous: $3,925) appreciated. As a long time buy-sider, I think one of the most important values the sell-side can bring is reframing an underappreciated dynamic. We don’t think we are going to disappoint.', 'We would highlight that this is not a short-term call. We do think Street estimates for fulfillment in particular are modeled too low in H121 based on the company’s message that they are embarking on another fulfillment center investment cycle – made loud and clear in our view on the 2Q20 call. Also, we all know eCommerce has seen a massive acceleration from the pandemic, but can imagine guiding could be challenging. Long term, we would bet that over a 4-year period a Long AMZN / Short the market position will be handsomely rewarded.', 'There are a few observations we wanted to highlight:', 'Everybody who is using a SOTP model for AMZN is doing so incorrectly (ourselves too). We also are not huge fan of SOTP models because the Buy-side or Sell-side makes inaccurate conclusions, but in AMZN’s case think is necessary. Why we are not a fan: These SOTP analyses are often done as means to justify that a company is worth more than it is currently trading at, but let us be clear. Analysts may lie – the market doesn’t lie - and the associated price a stock currently trades at is what it is. It can turn out to be true, taking the case of Icahn’s successful push to separate PYPL from EBAY. We would argue there are a lot more reasons that untethered from EBAY, PYPL has been able to transform into a different business than it would if still owned by EBAY. But back to our initial point, analysts may lie – stocks don’t lie. Massive kudos to whomever bet alongside Mr. Icahn, but this has been a grand slam home run, with PYPL alone at a 230bn mkt cap. We do not remotely subscribe to the thesis that AWS profits – highly profitable and quantifiable – are being used to “subsidize” retail losses.', 'SOTP debates aside, we would all concur that more disclosure is better than less disclosure. This typically leads to multiple expansion given investors greater understanding of the different moving pieces of complex businesses. Examples we would cite are BABA (cloud and offline have been huge drags on a highly profitable core business), NFLX (domestic is highly profitable vs international), and GOOG most recently took a cue from some of these other mega-caps. Ironically, AMZN over the last few years has gone from the mega-cap disclosing the least to the one disclosing the most.', 'Now let’s chitty chat AMZN. We think the street often tries to ascribe different multiples to AWS (they certainly should), advertising, subscription, FBA, GMV, 1p revs, 3p revs etc. You name it, somebody has done it. The only reported FACTS we have about OI is AWS, Domestic and International so all the other assumptions are being made by the Street.', 'We have historically modeled for our SOTP: 1) Domestic and 2) International GMV (we gross up the 3 party GMV and admittedly are making an assumption on the take rate, as it likely has only continued to uptick given FBA growth), 3) AWS, 4) Advertising, and then have applied a “holding company discount”.', 'We believe you could nitpick our approach to international GMV. That said, we believe: 1) The company remains in aggressive investment mode – particularly in India – and suspect this market alone is a large % of the international losses', '2) Based on our channel work, we are of the view that most of the Western European markets are doing MSD % OI margins 3) Unlike China, which was a guaranteed unwinnable fight for AMZN relative to Chinese natives like JD, and BABA, there was a zero-probability chance the Chinese government would allow ecommerce to be dominated by a foreign player. 4) By comparison, we think the Indian government is way more foreign business friendly, and valuing the company on retail OI (god knows how many assumptions you need to make to come up w a clean retail OI number) would attribute no value to international revenues.', 'We would advocate the investors should essentially look at the business in two primary buckets: AWS and Everything Else So why do we think so? AMZN is probably the company that penned the term “Flywheel” or certainly made it pervasive in the investment and operating communities. What do we mean? Let’s start to dissect by reporting line. Retail - The 1p and 3p businesses, while with different margin structures – 3p is much higher and reported only as the net take, are intimately intertwined. They benefit from the same end-customer base. With FBA’s continued expansion and penetration as a % of the 3P business, they often share the same warehouse space, as well as the same logistics/delivery providers. They share the same payment processing and benefit from the same marketing. We have long put zero stock in trying to look at one vs. the other. FBA increasing as % of the mix is good for retail margins and AMZN’s take rate, but to our SOTP comment, we are not going to try and put a different multiple on one vs. the other. Subscription – Prime – Sweet Sweet AMZN Prime. While we get that investors love subscription businesses because they are sticky, recurring, and have much greater degrees of predictability, AMZN Prime is all about the flywheel. There may be a small base of Audible users or more on the come with its recent Luna Cloud gaming service announcement, but end of the day the subscription business at 19.2bn in 2019 is all about Prime. Back to our Flywheel comment, the Prime business exists because of the robust selection, and value proposition it represents to end consumers. And to further sweeten the deal, AMZN over the last 5-7 years has only further increased the value of a prime subscription by including an increasingly robust offering of streaming video, streaming audio and most recently, 1-day shipping. On the other side of the “network effect”, the larger the Prime subscriber base, the more enfranchised sellers are in participating in AMZN’s FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) program. Having the “Prime Enabled” logo next to your item, is a key driver to a shopper’s propensity to click. So back to our comments about Retail, Prime and Retail are intimately intertwined. Within that context, we think ascribing a value to Subscription in SOTP separately also makes no sense Advertising – As we have framed in our earlier notes about AMZN’s ad business, 1) We think they are the only online player really benefiting from trade budgets today, 2) We believe there was an evolution internally in which AMZN found the right advertising business for AMZN. We estimate at least 85-90% of the AMZN business today is sponsored listings. In this scenario, an advertiser pays for higher placement within the product sort order, the user stays on AMZN, and AMZN keeps the transaction and transaction data. To use CPG as an example (we think by far the largest advertiser vertical on AMZN), we think P&G, Unilever, Energizer - companies that don’t have a real DTC strategy -view advertising on AMZN to be not so different than paying for favorable shelf placement at WMT, TGT, KR, etc. The reality is, this is a) where their customers are, b) has better quantifiable results than the offline analog, so have been happy participants. We think that AMZN could become more aggressive with AMZN Fire/potentially giving the TV device away to further drive their video inventory, but think that this hasn’t happened yet (but who knows – prime day is around the bend), but a development worth closely watching. Similar to Retail and Prime, we think investors have potentially thought through the Ad business as being a separate business unit, but we think that it sits under the broader retail umbrella to a greater degree than investors recognize. The ad business doesn’t exist without retail.', 'So why does this all matter? Let’s do a little fun math. 1) FY 2015 North America margin was 4.3%, international was (0.3%) 2) The FY 2015 Other revenue line in totality was $1.7bn (with advertising likely $1.2-1.3bn), 3) Street estimated GAAP EBIT is ~$69bn for 2024 In our view, 2016 was the year advertising had the real break out - with Other revenues growing 74% y/y and advertising growing, we estimate, ~90% y/y. For context, our estimate of advertising was $13.8bn in 2019, growing 41% y/y to ~19.4bn in 2020. Now this is where it gets interesting – based on our channel work, and some common sense, we estimate that advertising EBIT margins (if it were a stand- alone) are north of 80%, and believe that could even be CONSERVATIVE. Running this math based on 2019 actuals, Non-AWS EBIT was $5.3bn, and', 'Advertising if looked in isolation would be ~$11bn – implying that the rest of the business is losing money??!?!?!?!?! We actually think of this as a huge positive not a negative. As we stated under bullet 4, we think that there is AWS and Everything Else so we look at advertising as another part of the Flywheel. Valuation is often more of an art-form than pure science, but end of the day what matters is what is the underlying earnings potential of the business. In our view, we think the key exercise for valuing AMZN, is to do is the following: Take AWS Revenues and EBIT estimates for 2024 (newly published today) – we are at ~$100bn in revenues and $34.5bn in OI Assume the “stand-alone” advertising business does $52bn and an estimated margin of 75% (let’s assume they do more around CTV/Fire TV so the margin goes down from predominantly sponsored products, that is $39bn! So combined, between these two lines, we are already at $73.5bn in EBIT If we assume that the non-ad components of the north American retail biz are able to get back to a 4% EBIT margin as they were in 2015 (North America was 4.3%), we would get on our estimates of retail revenues of 19.5bn All in, this is $93bn of EBIT “Earnings Power” vs the street at $69bn – 14% EBIT margins vs the street at ~10% Assuming we are correct, by 2024 investors won’t need to do these financial acrobatics, because the underlying report EBIT of the busines will show up flowing through the income statement.', 'Let’s entertain the negative side and see where we could be wrong. Do you mean to say AMZN is back to its old days of selling things at a loss? And don’t they always find a way to keep spending? Well yes and no. We think this comparison to 2015 margins is a decent proxy to think through earnings power, and are expect international EBIT will be positive by then as well. We do see a few big step function potential costs that are worth framing, and want to discuss where our logic could be wrong. There has been a huge amount of incremental investment into the business with fulfillment having slowed in 19/18 in terms of order of magnitude y/y dollar growth pretty substantially – we think there is a massive step up this year Content costs – a straight up gross margin headwind have increased substantially and potentially could again We actually think a more logical owner of things like NFL rights at the next round of negotiations is more likely to be AMZN, AAPL or GOOG relative to the current rights holders as we suspect we have hit a negative inflection point with linear viewing/cable subscribers. We also think that the potential for one of these tech companies, who each have MASSIVE international audiences to have a big impact on the league’s international presence and brand would likely only further drive this – this would be a huge step up in content costs One day shipping evolves into same day shipping – as we have been writing about since initiating on AMZN last year, we have viewed one day shipping as a step along the road on the way to inevitable same day shipping – a clear incremental driver of incremental cost headwinds. The grocery category is clearly one of the last uncaptured categories of huge TAM- particularly in the US. We think that the elements of fresh product, different fulfillment center needs (in part because of perishable), are subscale at this point. But would highlight that 1) we think Bezos’ world view is that he wants AMZN to own as large a percent of the consumers wallet as possible – if they dominate in grocery, they will have largely achieved that, 2) groceries are arguably to last category within which AMZN is not dominant, so see fewer negative new category introduction headwinds and 3) we are assuming AMZN can ultimately get to a ~3-4% EBIT margin in grocery at scale. Logistics? – we have been of the view for several years, that AMZN has ambitions to compete with FDX/UPS in the top US cities/where they have the most density. We think investors have been paying for some of these investments “along the way”, and think that AMZN has pulled back mid-Covid from their intentions to compete with the third-party carriers, but think this is a function of necessity given the incredible high level of demand for all eCommerce companies. We would be shocked if AMZN is not in market well in advance of 2024 – pricing below their peers. Overall, we think this competitive push would be a headwind to EBIT, but would be favorably viewed as a new leg of the AMZN story. The ad business is more mature than we appreciate. We think that the ad biz grows correlated with GMV and while we have estimated GMV growth of 13% in 2024, and ad growth at 20%, potentially we are overestimating the headroom in the business.', 'In summary, we think that most of these potential large pockets of investment (ex-fulfillment build-out) would likely be seen as incremental drivers of revenue growth, so to the extent EBIT numbers are too high, we would suspect the revenue numbers are likely too low. AMZN long-term skeptics will respond to an analysis such as this that they always manage to spend away the upside, but if grocery is in fact the last “frontier” category, we think they will', 'WHERE WE COULD BE WRONG: 1) AWS continues to slow faster than we expect, 2) 3 party fees at 26.7% for 2018 (we model their exit run rate for Q4 at 27.3%) see material pressure. AMZN began reducing some fees over the last 2 months - we are nervous that they could actually be way too high, but don’t know how to handicap magnitude, 3) offline retail is able to strike back harder than we appreciate – we are surprised WMT already had its wheels in motion in terms of a response 4) we are underestimating the size of the investment cycle. Incremental investment for one-day is impacting shipping costs – if they really want to get this right, it could be a material investment in fulfillment too.', 'RISKS: 1) Over saturation of AMZN within eCommerce, 2) macro-economic deceleration causes greater than expected declines in commerce, 3) AWS slows materially, and 4) anti-trust action.']","4,500",BUY

This framework holds that the modern analyst should measure prices in relation to gold for tangible assets and measure the market value of intangibles in relation to bitcoin to derive real prices and real estimates of economic activity and values.', 'Under our Bitcoin Gold Dow Theory analysis framework, there are three ways overvalued stock prices can return to fair value. 1) Share prices can fall 2) Share prices can remain the same while the companies increase their underlying value (value and price converge in the future) 3) The value of money falls (this could result in an increase in nominal share prices but a decline in the real purchasing power of the shares).', 'Since the time of our previous report, the price of money (as measure by gold and BTC) has declined and Amazon has increased its underlying value. Since our Sept 4, 2018 Sell recommendation, AMZN’s share price has declined 4.98% in nominal prices and declined 27.99% relative to BTC and declined 19.83% relative to gold.', 'Since the time of our initial July 24, 2017 Sell recommendation, AMZN’s share price has risen 86.46%, while BTC has risen 241.88% and Gold has risen 12.76%. Thus, in real prices as measured by BTC, AMZN’s share price has declined by 45.46% since our initial Sell recommendation while our USD price recommendation has been incorrect. Using GLD against AMZN’s tangible book value and BTC against the difference between AMZN’s market value and book value, AMZN’s share price has fallen 39.9% close to our original estimate of a 37% overvaluation.', 'At the time of our initial report (July 24, 2017), Amazon was valued at $1025.67 while BTC traded at $2779 or a ratio of .369. We had a price target of .04 BTC, $640, or .11 gold oz which implied a BTC price of $16,000, a gold price of $5800, or a decline in Amazon’s share price in USD. We point this out given that our initial BTC target was surpassed in December 2017. Based on today’s level of monetary insanity we have a BTC target of $20,568 and a gold price target of $6,652. At today’s BTC price of $9,500.71 the ratio of Amazon’s share price to BTC is .201 and while Amazon’s share price to gold ratio is roughly 1.42.', 'Fintrust Brokerage Services is raising our Sell rating to Hold , and we are raising our nominal price target price from $1,111 current USD to $1,611 on the basis of our dividend discount model and current interest rates. Our target prices relative to BTC is .078 and our gold relative target is .24 gold ounces in our real purchasing power price estimates. This represents 15.7% nominal downside from today’s price of $1,911.', 'As repeatedly stated in our reports, our estimates are naturally wide given we are in the midst of the largest money debasement in a “Western” country, since John Law in 1720 or the German hyperinflation of 1914-1923. Our valuation calculations under various scenarios range from a low of $1170 to a high $2550 per share in current USD. The wide range of estimates is the natural outgrowth the company’s high growth rates and historically low interest rates. Discounted cash flow models for high growth companies in a negative to near zero interest rate environment return nearly infinite prices for the value of an equity that invests cash today and promises cash tomorrow because cash today has nearly no value, while cash later, if it materializes, has potentially large value.', 'Using Valueline, we calculate that Amazon has realized a 10-year historical growth rate in equity of 28%. In addition to our own analysis, we used Valueline’s 2020 earnings estimate of $35.60 and projected cashflows forward for 20 years and then discount those earnings back at 6% and added this sum to Valueline’s estimated 2019 book value estimate ($131.55) to derive a fair value estimate of $2,011. At the current $1,911 per share price, we estimate that the market is discounting Amazon’s like a 20-year monopoly that will sustain a 16% growth rate.', 'While we understand the market’s pricing for AMZN, we continue to note that one of history’s other great trading, logistics and information monopolies, the Dutch East India company, realized returns of 18% for 200 years, after being granted a 21-year monopoly, but its earnings and dividends were irregular in amount and form. In addition, we note that the company’s stock price reached a record low dividend yield of 3.5% and record stock price high of just over $1100 per share, during the period that coincided with the peak insanity of John Law’s monetary system in 1720. Using Valueline’s 2020, $70.25 per share cashflow estimate for each Amazon.com share and dividing by 3.5% we derive a $2007 price. Importantly for price targets, Amazon.com retains its earnings, whereas the Dutch East India Company distributed its earnings (source: globalfinancialdata.com), as a result, the share price, book value, and our estimates of fair value would be expected to continue to increase over time.', 'Source: FinTrust estimates', 'Source: FinTrust estimates']","1,611",HOLD

Apple’s flagship 5G iPhone 12 line-up launched in 2020 sold 100mn units two months earlier than the iPhone 11. Volumes were close to its iPhone 6 super-cycle during the 4G transition in 2015. Customers see 5G as a key reason for upgrading their iPhones after years of holding back replacements. Apple’s new iPhone 13 line-up is expected to be launched in September 2021, featuring up to 20% more efficiency and larger batteries to complement the power-hungry 5G phone. In anticipation of strong demand, Apple has ordered more than 100mn A15 chips from TSMC for the launch, 25% more than the 75mn chips for its 2020 iPhones. We expect the iPhone super-cycle to continue, with FY21e and FY22e sales potentially topping 2015’s record of 231mn units sold. This would be powered by upgrades from an estimated 48% of the iPhone users still using iPhone X and older. iPhone sales are Apple’s main cash cow, at 50% of sales in FY20.', '2. Margins to remain elevated. Strong growth in Apple’s services is expected to lift gross margins, together with higher ASPs of 5G devices in the product segment. Service margins of 66% are more than double product margins. Service revenue has also been expanding at a faster CAGR of 17% vs flat growth for iPhone. Growth is spearheaded by Apple’s ever-growing installed base, which topped 1.65bn in January 2021. Apple expects service growth to moderate after a bumper 3Q21 - when YoY growth was 33% from the COVID-19 rebound - to more sustainable double digits. Apple’s 5G products also allow it to raise weighted ASPs by more than 20% from a year ago, boosting product margins. We expect gross margins to track above 40% in FY21e and FY22e, higher than their 5-year historical average of 38%.', '3. Gaining market share through supply-chain dominance. As competitors grapple with chip shortages, Apple’s share of global smartphone sales breached 5-year highs, hitting 21% in 4Q21. In the high-end market, Samsung was hit by its Texas semiconductor fabrication plant’s month-long power shut-down and Vietnam factory suspensions due to COVID-19. Samsung’s new Galaxy Note’s launch in 2H21 may be delayed as a result. Apple managed to mitigate shortages in 3QFY21, with the revenue impact coming in lower than its US$3-4bn guidance.

Apple last year lowered its fee to 15% for smaller developers making less than US$1mn per year from their apps.

(AAPL) recently released its 2QFY16 results on 26 Apr-16. Results were not well received, with AAPL share price taking a tumble by more than 6% on the next market day. iPhone units sales were slightly above consensus expectations but revenue and EPS came in below consensus estimates. This marked the first time iPhone sales have fallen. Poor results along with poor profit guidance for the quarter ahead, which is far below consensus estimates, led to the drop in share price. AAPL has experienced a 10.5% decline in share price over a 1 year period.', 'Fall in revenue and earnings. AAPL reported quarter revenue of US$50.6 bn, missing consensus estimate by US$1.37 bn and EPS of US1.90, missing by US$0.10. Gross margin was 39.4% vs 40.8% yoy.', 'Services were the saving grace. AAPL reported US$6 bn in revenue for Services, an increase of 20% yoy. It cited growth in its App store, where revenue grew 35% yoy and Apple Music increased its paying subscriber base from 11 mn to 13 mn over the year. Apple Pay also increased its transactions volume by 5x.', 'Other Products revenue increased. Apple Watch sales helped to pull up the Other Products category by 30% yoy.', 'Hardware sales continue weakening. iPhone unit sales were down 16% yoy, iPad and Mac unit sales were also down by 19% and 12% yoy, respectively.', 'Initiating coverage with ""Buy"" rating AAPL has had impressive 840% growth rate over the past 10 years, with iPhone as its main growth driver. Despite recent weakness, AAPL is still generating enormous profits and cash. AAPL generated more than US$50 bn in revenue and more than US$10 bn in net income during a difficult quarter. Additionally, its expansion in Services segment could provide support to its future growth. Services has been increasing at an incredible rate, averaging about 20% growth over 5 years, and as AAPL expands its services, users would become more entrenched into its ecosystem.', 'We are Positive on the Company’s long term prospects, supported by its robust established user base and strong balance sheet. Nonetheless, much would still hinges on the Company’s ability to innovate and contribution from its new products.', 'We have a DCF valuation of US$119.37 for AAPL .', 'iPhone sales are the main revenue source for AAPL and accounts for 65% of AAPL’s total revenue. As such, AAPL is known primarily as a hardware company, selling iPhones. The Company has taken steps to diversify its revenue streams. While these steps do show promise, but at this point in time, the impact on total revenue is negligible compared to the revenue from the iPhone.', 'iPhone had a phenomenal year in FY2015, which saw accelerated upgrade rate leading to close to 40% yoy sales growth. Unit sales have increased at an impressive CAGR of 17% yoy over the past 4 years.', 'However, with the poor showing in its latest quarter results, coupled with near term macro headwinds and market saturation, it is likely that iPhone sales for the remaining of 2016 could be flattish, and this year could be the first year that AAPL will report a decline in unit sales.', 'That said, AAPL mentioned several mitigating factors that could underpin iPhone Sales: Upgrades. The first half of the upgrade cycle for iPhone 6s has seen a slightly higher rate than the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago. It cited a Kantar survey showing a 95% iPhone loyalty rate. Furthermore, according to Kantar, the iPhone 6 and 6 plus accounted only for 24% of all iPhones being used in US and China (US and China iPhone users account for 65% of its total user base). Coupled with iPhones 6s sales, that represents a sizable portion of current iPhone users that have yet to upgrade to the 6 or 6s, which AAPL could tap on when the next iteration is introduced. This was also mentioned previously by Tim Cook, with 60% of current iPhone users have yet to upgrade.', 'Switchers. AAPL mentioned that there were more switchers from Android or other platforms to iOS in the 1HFY16 compared to any other six-month period ever.', 'First timer. AAPL mentioned that India could be the next growth driver and market for iPhones, citing iPhone sales in India were up 56% yoy. While global smartphone market seems to have reached saturation point in developed nations, India’s LTE network is still rolling out, representing a large untapped market. First timers are crucial to the Company’s long term growth. Each new user is a potential loyal AAPL user. Once the user becomes entrenched into its “Eco-system”, the user could start engaging in its Services and purchasing other AAPL products.', 'iPhone SE, released on 31 March was not included in 2QFY16’s results. AAPL cites that demand for iPhone SE has exceeded its expected supply, leading also to the depressed 3QFY16 profit guidance. Should sales for the iPhone SE take off, it would be indicative of pent up demand for cheaper iPhones and an opportunity for AAPL to create further headway into developing markets.', 'Should AAPL follow its previous release schedules and release the iPhone 7 around September (end FY16), it could also entice the large pool of older iPhone users to upgrade as the iPhone 5 and 5s would be 2 product cycles old by then. However, the new iPhone 7 could only start contributing to its bottom line in FY17.', 'Given these factors, we believe that while iPhones will face headwinds in the increasingly saturated developed nations’ smartphone market, the fears of “peak iPhone” are', 'overblown and believe that there is potential for iPhone sales to grow in the future, albeit at a slower rate.', 'AAPL’s tablet offering; the iPad, used to account for about 18% of AAPL’s total revenue. However, the rapid growth of iPhones and falling iPad sales has led to iPad now making up only 10% of AAPL’s total revenue.', 'Tablets have longer replacement cycles compared to smartphones as consumers are less compelled to upgrade their tablets compared to smartphones. In 2QFY16, AAPL reported iPad sales were down 19% yoy with unit sales of 10.25 mn. iPad sales were slightly better than consensus estimates which were on average about 9.95 mn. Of note however, the new 9.7 inch iPad Pro was only released at the end of Q2 2016 and sales figures would not have captured the full extent of demand. AAPL expects the next quarter to be the best iPad quarter in two years based on their estimates. For now, we expect the iPad to continue accounting for a smaller component of AAPL’s revenue over time.', 'Macs are AAPL’s laptops offering, they account for 11% of AAPL’s revenue. Mac unit sales have been on the uptrend over the past 3 years as the Macbook has gained popularity and more mainstream acceptance. However, Macbook sales fell 9% yoy in 2QFY16, which was worse than consensus estimates. However, a silver lining is that AAPL is gaining traction in China, where 80% of the Chinese Mac buyers were purchasing for the first time. Management has given guidance that it expects Mac sales to increase in 3QFY16 on the back of an updated Macbook, which was thinner and lighter with better specs. As one of AAPL core offerings, we expect Mac sales to maintain its share of revenue as it gains traction as a viable alternative to PCs. We believe that Mac sales will increase as compared to the iPad, despite both having similarly long replacement cycles compared to iPhone due to Mac having greater functionality.', 'Apple Watch led to a 30% yoy growth in Other Product revenue, since it is a relatively new product offering, the Watch has generated new avenues of revenue for AAPL. Whether the take up rate can continue or the Watch becoming like the iPad in terms of replacement rate remains to be seen.', 'Revenue from Services rose 20% yoy to US$6 bn in 2QFY16. “Apple as a service” is a concept that AAPL has taken large steps towards and is increasingly becoming the bright spot in the current environment of stalling hardware sales. Services create the “Eco- system” which allows AAPL to further entrench its user base, creating more reasons for its “stickability”. AAPL has been showing that it is increasingly able to monetize that active user base to generate more revenue from its services. In the 1QFY16, AAPL revealed that it had 1 bn active installed base, devices that were actively engaged in Services within that quarter, leading to Installed Base Related Purchases of US$8.9 bn. This figure grew by 27% yoy to US$9.9 bn in the March quarter.', 'App Store. Revenue grew by 35% yoy, generating 90% more global revenue than Google Play.', 'Apple Music. Music grew from 10 mn to 13 mn paying subscribers since introducing a download and streaming model, leading AAPL to be optimistic that Apple Music revenue will start growing again moving forward.', 'Apple Pay. Being very new, Apple Pay is not expected to make significant contribution to AAPL’s FY16 revenue. However, adoption rate is increasing exponentially, with transactions volume growing by 500% yoy. AAPL has launched over 2.5 mn locations that accept Apple Pay, with plans to expand further. While usage rates remain low, as the idea of NFC (Near Field Communication) payment is still new and not widely adopted yet, there is still much room for growth and eventually monetization. However, with credit card companies like Visa, as well as other phone companies like Samsung, are also heading into the space, the idea of NFC payments might not take that long to be legitimized. As such, we view this as an avenue with great potential in the future.', 'Overall, we see great potential in “Apple as a service”. It remains the one category of revenue that AAPL has been able to achieve consecutive double-digit growth, on average about 20%, over the past 5 years. Services provide recurring revenue stream for AAPL that could grow independent of the unit sales, making it especially helpful in the current environment of slowing hardware sales. We expect Services revenue to continue to grow and become a greater part of AAPL’s revenue as upgrade cycles for iPhones stretch to 2-3 years.', 'Of note though, is China’s recent ban of AAPL iBooks and iTunes Movies, which could be a potentially worrying trend. Considering that if Services are to be the future of AAPL and China’s important role in this strategy, then it would be a huge detriment to AAPL’s future growth if the ban expands to the rest of AAPL’s services. For now however, with just the iBooks and iTunes Movies ban, while worrying, it is not a large dent in AAPL’s services growth and the thesis of Service growth should still hold.', 'AAPL main revenue source by region comes from Americas, which makes up 40% of the total revenue. While Americas’ contribution to AAPL’s revenue has been increasing on an absolute value, it has not been growing at a very fast pace. Americas’ revenue grew 4% in 2014 when total revenue grew 7%, and grew at 17% yoy in 2015 when total revenue grew at 28%. It is likely that Americas’ revenue will continue to grow at a slower pace as compared to the total revenue.', 'On the other hand, Greater China, which currently makes up 25% of its total revenue, has been rising at an incredibly fast pace. In 2014, Greater China only made up 17.4%, this represents an 84% yoy increase. In the 2QFY16, China had a qoq change of -32% from 1QFY16, and a yoy change of -26%. China was the main reason for AAPL’s explosive growth in the previous year, growing by 84% yoy in FY15. In comparison, 2QFY16’s results appears dismal, coming in at US$12.5 bn vs previous year’s US$16.8 bn. When seen against the backdrop of such a breakout year previously, it is not surprising that investors have reacted negatively to AAPL’s performance this quarter in China. However, we feel that this is less of a slowdown and more of a normalization of AAPL’s sales in China. AAPL’s YTD revenue from China stands at roughly US$30.8 bn, already almost as much as FY14, where revenue from China was US$31.8 bn. As LTE network continues to expand in China and adoption increases, we expect China’s demand for iPhones to continue to grow. However, whether China adopts the same replacement rate that Americas has had over the past years remains to be seen. Regardless, China should continue to be a growing source of revenue for AAPL.', 'As mentioned earlier, India is also a developing market which could provide avenues of future growth for AAPL, sales having grown 56% yoy. As LTE networks continue to rollout, smartphones become more useable as compared to 2.5G or 3G networks, leading to increase demand. APAC ex Japan accounted only for US$15 bn, being home to more developing nations, but as those nations continue to develop, AAPL should be able to take advantage of improvements in infrastructure to expand there.', 'AAPL has amassed a large amount of cash, with US$232.9 bn in cash and marketable securities as of 31 Mar 2016, up almost US$20 bn yoy. However, 90% of this cash hoard is outside the USA. This is significant due to USA tax laws, which would cause AAPL to have to pay upwards of about US$60 bn if it was to remit back to the USA. AAPL has thus taken advantage of the current low interest rate environment to take on more debt. AAPL issued another US$15.5 bn in USD notes in the latest quarter, bringing its debt level to about US$72 bn. This puts its current net cash position at about US$160 bn, which is equivalent to about US$30 per share. Most of the borrowings has been put to fund the Capital return program, mainly dividends and share buybacks.', '5. Attractive Capital Return Program Dividends and buyback increased . AAPL announced a further increase to its capital return program on 26 April 2016, increasing it to US$250 bn from US$200 bn in April 2015. The dividend was increased to US$0.57 per share for shareholders on close of business 9 May- 16, up c.10% from US$0.52. Since AAPL started paying a dividend in 2012, it has increased the dividend each year consecutively, from US$0.38 per share to US$0.52, with a CAGR of about 8%p.a. This represents a payout ratio of about 24%, which is relatively low, indicating that there is still substantial room for future dividend growth. Share repurchase authorization was also increased from US$140 bn to US$175 bn.', 'Valuation Methodology: Discounted Free Cash Flow Model DCF model was used to derive a valuation of AAPL’s intrinsic value.', 'We have made the following assumptions for the model: Headwinds in iPhone sales leading to decline and slow growth over the next two years, after which iPhone sales should start growing at a slower rate iPad sales may pick up in the next FY but repeat the cycle of slow replacement, leading to flat revenue Increase in Mac take up as Macbooks gain traction and more mainstream acceptance as PC and laptop replacements Service Revenue will increase as AAPL expands their ecosystem and continues to increase the monetization of their user base', 'We initiate coverage for AAPL with a “ Buy ” rating with a target price of US$119.37 , derived from our DCF estimates.', 'Poor response to iPhone 7. While AAPL’s customer base is very loyal, if iPhone 7 has a lacklustre showing and fails to excite that base, it could lead to even lower take up and a longer replacement cycle. Weaker consumer sentiment amidst slowdown in the global economy could also negatively impact the take up of iPhones.', 'Slowdown in Services. Services have been growing at an incredible rate and been the one bright spot in the 2QFY16. AAPL transitioning into more of a Services company rather than a Hardware company also forms the basis for our estimates of future growth. If Services revenue slows down or if consumers fail to become entrenched into AAPL’s ecosystem, it would adversely affect AAPL and our valuations.', 'It is difficult to find a one to one comparison to AAPL in the US market, as while its peers do have some overlap with AAPL, there is also large differences between them. As such, we have chosen to show Google and Microsoft as peer comparisons. Google is relevant for the Android comparison and Microsoft is relevant for the Windows phone, PC and its recent move into a Service company as well.', 'AAPL remains the largest of the three companies by market cap. Based on PER, it is also the more undervalued stock amongst the three, trading at about 10x PER while the other two trade at more than 30x PER.', 'AAPL, at US$92.79, is also trading near its 52 week low of US$91.85. Based on the Historical PER chart below, it is also trading at near 8 year low valuations. At US$92.79, AAPL is trading at 10.32x PER as compared to its 5-year historical average of 13.7x PER.', 'AAPL gave poor guidance for 3QFY16, citing continued macro headwinds sending AAPL shares tumbling down. We expect AAPL’s share price to remain depressed in the short term, while the market reacts bearishly to AAPL prospects and fears on iPhone’s saturation.', 'However, AAPL’s balance sheet remains strong with net cash at almost US$160 bn, which works out to almost US$30 net cash per share. At current prices, that indicates a net price US$60 per share, indicating a c.7x FY16e PER.', 'Additionally, its brand equity and loyal consumer base allows AAPL to continue to generate large profits and cash flow even in difficult seasons. Its growing Services revenue is promising as it shows AAPL is making headway in their transition to a Services company.', 'Therefore, we believe that the current knee jerk reaction in the market to AAPL is overblown, leading to AAPL being undervalued. As such, we initiate a “ Buy ” rating on AAPL with a Target Price of US$119.37 , indicating about a 28% upside to the share (excluding dividends).']",,

While the miss on operating income is Internet & Digital Media disappointing, we believe this creates a buying opportunity. We believe the company's underlying fundamentals remained intact with continued strong demand for Prime, FBA, and AWS. Both 1P and 3P revenue, as well as total paid units accelerated during the quarter, driven by continued momentum in Prime membership as retail subscription revenue accelerated. We believe FBA program continued to gain traction both domestically and internationally. AWS continued to grow over 40% y/y.

International revenue was $11.5B, up 22% y/y ex-FX, in-line with consensus. AWS continued to ramp with revenue growing 42% y/y to $4.1B in Q2, also in-line with consensus. Overall, we estimate Q2 GMV to be $79.7B, increasing 30% y/y. GAAP operating income was $628M in 2Q17, below consensus of $1.1B, primarily driven by step-up in investments in fulfillment, video content, and AWS infrastructure, as well as increased sales force related to AWS and Advertising.', 'In terms of revenue mix, retail subscription revenue totaled $2.2B, up 53% y/y ex-FX, indicating continued growth momentum in Prime membership. According to latest estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), U.S. Prime members reached 85M in 2Q17 and 28% of U.S. Prime members are monthly subscribers. We estimate global Prime members to be over 100M, taking into account monthly subscribers and lower international pricing.', 'In Q2, third-party (3P) retail revenue continued to outpace growth of first-party Stock Price Performance (1P) revenue, up 40% y/y ex-FX, compared to 18% y/y ex-FX for 1P.

The company reported iPhone unit sales of 39.3 million, growth of 21.8% on a revenue basis and 16.2% on a unit basis. We mention the unit growth remains materially below the IDC industry growth rate of 25.3%. Given that Apple is generating the majority of its revenue and profits from sales of the iPhone, we mention a few statistics taken from IDC data:', '1) The total growth of the mobile phone market (feature and smart phones) was 4.8% in 2013 (1.82 billion units).', '2) Smartphones have passed over 50% of mobile phone shipments, representing 55.1% of total in 2013.', '3) The smartphone market itself is slowing, from 46.6% in 2012, to 38.5% in 2013, the to 25% rate in the June quarter of 2014.', '4) Android took 84.7% market share in the June quarter, with iOS at 11.7% and we do not expect the iPhone 6 to materially change this dynamic.', '5) Apple was able to increase its ASP to $605 in the September quarter. This compares to 58.6% of the Android shipments in the June quarter costing less than $200 off contract. Apple commands a price more than double the average selling price of the broader market.', 'We mention these points to highlight that Apple’s current dependence on iPhone hardware sales may be a looming headwind. The market dynamics for smartphone growth is slowing and may converge to the 5% growth rates of the overall mobile phone market. For us to turn more positive on Apple shares we prefer to see a stronger recurring revenue stream with a monthly component coming from streaming music and movie, payments and advertising. We understand the company is positioning for these markets, and it remains to be seen if Apple can build up a robust service layer before the smartphone product cycle elongates.', 'Apple reported September quarter revenue of $42.1B. Revenue grew 12.4% YoY. Revenue for the FY 2014 was 182 B (+7% YoY) International sales accounted for 61.4% of total revenue in the September quarter and 64.3% for the full year. Apple returned over $19B to its shareholders in the September quarter.', 'iPhone: The company sold 39.2M (+12% YoY) units in the September quarter. Macintosh: Apple sold 5.5M (+25% YoY) Macs during the quarter. iPad: Unit sales and revenue declined for the third consecutive quarter. iPad revenue was the 5 worst level of the 18 quarters the product has been in existence, with the only quarters being lower the initial four quarters at launch.

We expect iPhone unit sales to drop to 42.5 million in the March quarter, reflecting typical seasonal declines and implying a 19% decline from the prior year.

Cook also noted the lack of subsidies by wireless operators in developed markets. That is not a new trend. On CNBC, Cook suggested that trade-ins offered by Apple can act as an effective subsidy, but operators have been offering trade-in promotions for years, albeit at lower levels in the past two years.

That’s given YoY capital markets strength (up 1/4th), deposit growth (equal to the 8 -largest bank), and matching revenues and expenses despite a 1/4th decline in NIM. Given a lack of reserve builds, it also reflects our theme that credit has improved as reflected by $25tn of fixed income assets (see our note from last week), meaning that 2Q20 marked a low point for EPS. Indeed, we increased ests. due to better than expected credit (see below). Otherwise, the earnings call implied a flattening out of NII from this point and enough reserves to handle a severe stress test scenario. The big industry questions are the extent that problems are delayed vs. resolved. For example, credit is mixed (NPAs up 18% QoQ but JPM doesn’t expect meaningful NCO increases until 2H21), loan growth will likely stay subdued (down 2% QoQ given paydowns), and the extent that capital markets are a pull forward (guided flattish investment banking in 4Q20).', 'Increasing estimates. We are increasing 2020 EPS from $6.00 to $7.15 largely reflecting 3Q20 results, but also higher 4Q20 EPS due to materially lower NCOs than previously modeled as well as continued momentum in investment banking and mortgage production. We also increased our 2021 EPS from $7.75 to $8.35 largely due to lower est. net charge-offs, which aren’t expected to materially increase until 2H21, partially offset by lower NII.', '3Q20 exceeds. JPM reported 3Q20 GAAP EPS of $2.92 (vs. consensus of $2.23) and est. operating (run-rate) EPS of $2.82 excl. (a) loan loss reserve release ($0.8bn pretax or 19c after-tax/sh), (b) above trend securities gains ($0.2bn or 5c), and (c) MSR-hedge noise ($0.1bn or 3c), partially offset by (d) litigation charge ($0.5bn or 17c). Results reflect flattish operating leverage YoY (est. core revenue and expenses both -1%). JPM’s CIB revenue were up 21% YoY (vs. est. up 11% in our model) led by trading and investment banking. Wholesale Payments were a touch better than expected. Other wholesale areas did better than expected, incl. Commercial Banking (flat YoY rev. vs. est. -5% in our model) and Asset Mgmt (+5% YoY vs. -3%). JPM Consumer outperformed low expectations (rev. -9% YoY vs. est. -14%). Core expenses were a touch lower than expected after adj. for one-timers and after taking account revenue-driven activities (IB, trading, mortgage). Credit provisions were materially lower than expected ($0.6bn actual vs. $2bn in our model) due to lower NCOs and reserve releases (portfolio related) instead of an expected modest reserve build.

Company-specific downside risks include higher-than-projected credit losses (especially in credit cards and home equity but also other consumer areas and commercial lending), market and interest-rate risks (which can affect JPMorgan's businesses and portfolios in a variety of ways, especially MSRs and investment securities), and operational risks (primarily associated with regulatory compliance across the firm's domestic consumer and global wholesale businesses)."", ""JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has excelled at both offense and defense over the past decade in which it has been gaining market share in all major business lines while optimizing its businesses, showing consistent earnings relative to other global banks and creating a fortress balance sheet (as defined by its CEO).

These include:', '1) Revenue decline of 15% YoY in the June quarter and our expectation of a decline of 8% in the September quarter, even at the upper end of company guidance. 2) We estimate FY2016 revenue declines 8% and FY2017 revenue declines 1%, and our bias remains to the downside. We see that it is more likely that the market for smartphones decelerates than accelerates. 3) September quarter guidance likely includes the benefit of building up channel inventory, which was decreased in the June quarter by 4 million units. 4) Channel inventory build may negatively impact December quarter results. 5) iPhone revenue declined for the second consecutive quarter, and we estimate that iPhone revenue to decline for the next 5 quarters on a year over year basis. 6) Average selling price for the iPhone dropped 10% YoY and 7% sequentially, driven by customer interest in lower priced iPhone SE, resulting in the lowest gross margins in 7 quarters. 7) Operating margin of 23.9% was the lowest in 7 years. 8) Greater China revenue declined 33% YoY and 29% sequentially, and even with adjustments for currency, we note the market declined in a quarter where the low cost iPhone SE was released. 9) Only two areas of the company produced revenue growth, iPad and Services. Services revenue, while touted by management, is only 14% of total. iPad revenue grew although units sold declined driven by higher ASPs. 10) Domestic cash is down to 7% of total, at $17 billion, a 29% sequential decline, limiting flexibility as the company returned $13 billion in the quarter, with a dividend commitment of $3.2 billion per quarter. Debt is $72 billion. 11) Shares keep making lower lows, and lower highs looking back to 2015, and remains precipitously subject to the consumer whim regarding the iPhone. 12) We give ourselves up to 9 months for the thesis to evolve and price target to be reached, after which we expect the iPhone 10 anniversary model to reset demand in the fall of 2017.', 'As we mentioned in our downgrade, with expectations for the June quarter low, and consensus at the midpoint of guidance, it was possible that shares rally. However, when we ask ourselves “Do we see Apple gaining or losing its next $100 billion of Company Data value”, the answer remains losing. The reason we picked $100 billion is to accommodate a rally such as today, and we still see that the dynamics of the next iPhone cycle is positioned to disappoint the market.

A return of mobility could dent the at- home strength PEP has seen - both in Food and Beverage - albeit that\'s more conceptual at this point, and PEP has invested heavily into sustaining brand momentum into 2022. Nevertheless, a year of +7% pricing (on top of a year with +5% pricing) with historically di\ue003cult volume comps creates a bit of a balancing act - momentum (yes), but tough comps too - so it\'s hard to say if the volume call is conservative.

For COGS, this would imply commodities in Q1/2/3/421 were a negative -1.7/-2.8/-5.2/-7.1% impact, i.e. an exit rate of over 7%, and our sense is this is building into 2022 with a HSD potential impact to COGS just from commodities. Taking PEP's 7% pricing target (+$5.5bn), and assuming commodities a ~9% hit to COGS (-$3.4bn), that'd imply an additional $2bn of wiggle room from the pricing. Wages/labor in\ue001ation is at least +MSD (note: roughly half of SG&A is labor). If we assume all of SG&A is +5%, that'd be ~+$1.5bn. Basically, that bridge leaves you about +MSD% op pro\ue000t growth to drop to the bottom-line.

Revenue from iPhone unit sales grew at an even slower pace at 10% YoY, as customers opted for older models at lower prices. Average selling price declined $35 sequentially and $76 from the December quarter. ASPs of $561 are still materially above the expected industry average of $314 in 2014 according to IDC. While Apple is currently enjoying success selling its old model phones into emerging markets, one has to question the long term viability as competition becomes more aggressive in the mid and entry markets, offering consumers current model phones at similar or lower price points, and with a willingness to capture less gross margin. The mix shift to the older model Apple phones resulted in gross margins of 39.4%, above the company guidance of 37-38%, and 250 basis points above the prior year June quarter. We expect the favorable gross margin trends to reverse starting in the current quarter as the next generation iPhone should have a lower margin profile particularly if the phone has a sapphire screen.', 'iPad. The company saw its second consecutive quarter of decline in iPad units sold on a YoY basis. Unit sales at 13.3 million were approximately half of the December quarter unit sales. While investors have largely glossed over the decline in iPad revenue, we mention it is a distinct possibility that Apple may experience declines in iPhone unit sales after the next upgrade cycle, if consumers lengthen the life span for smartphones as core features such as LTE, fingerprint scanning, and larger screens have the potential to satiate the typical customer. Our estimates for the coming upgrade cycle include some larger numbers such as 59.5 million phones in the December quarter, a number that may be hard to eclipse in the December 2015 quarterly results.', 'Channel inventory. We estimate that iPhone channel inventory was kept near record levels at 15.25 million units, a small decline of 150k units from the March quarter. We also mention that while the company disclosed the change in channel inventory, it stopped providing the absolute number. For comparison, the company reduced channel inventory by 600K units in the prior year June quarter to 11 million units. The growth of channel inventory at 39% YoY meaningfully outpaces the unit sales volume of 10% YoY. Using 13 weeks in the quarter, and based on the 35.203 million units sold in the quarter (a pace of 2.7 million units per week), we note that 15.25 million units in the channel represents approximately 5.5 weeks on inventory.

Yet, JPM indicated that its large reserve builds in 1Q20 ($7bn) could get repeated ahead given its worse economic forecasts. We lower our est. for 2020 ($6.30 to $4.60) but keep our 2021 est. ($7.35) and price target ($115) the same. We suspect that JPM’s economic assumptions will be more conservative than most.', 'Crisis impacts. Results in 1Q20 did not reflect too much of the downturn as credit losses declined QoQ and the net interest margin was about flat. Looking ahead, JPM now has worse economic forecasts for 2Q20 GDP (-40% vs. -25%) and unemployment (-20% vs. -10%), which means that 2Q20 may be a kitchen sink quarter like 1Q20. Items to watch include mortgage forbearance (4% so far), decline in purchase volume for restaurant and T&E (down 50%+), and com’l revolver utilization (record 44%). Period-end assets increased QoQ ($2.7tn to $3.1tn), w/large increases in CIB (+33%), the com’l bank (+12%), and for March (up $100bn). Also, debt underwriting and trading were at all-time records in 1Q20.', 'Balance sheet resiliency. We continue to view this as an income statement recession and not a balance sheet one for banks. Despite charges of $9bn, JPM still had decent capital (CET1 ratio of 11.5% vs. 10.5% min.), cash (access to $1tn), and flattish book value. Reported EPS of $0.78 would equal $2.89 ex-reserve builds and almost $2bn of charges for bridge loans and derivatives. Trading was strong (up 1/3 YoY), boding well for GS, trust banks, and other capital market players in 1Q20. Also, spreads have tightened since quarter-end. The main issue was a 43% QoQ increase in NPAs (some CECL-related) and reserve builds of $6.8bn (cards and CECL a big component) as JPM seeks to get ahead of upcoming credit losses.', 'Income statement mixed. Est. core efficiency improved to 55% vs. 56% (QoQ and YoY) with slightly faster revenue than expense growth both QoQ (6% vs. 3%) and YoY (4% vs. 3%) and it lowered 2020 expenses guidance ($67bn to $65bn now). This mitigates the new NII guidance ($55.5bn vs. $57bn). However, there are now new fee headwinds (asset management, NIR in trading, credit card purchasing volume down, lower card outstandings, more). The bottom line is that we expect 1H20 to reflect a kitchen sink period that, should it prove too conservative, will provide more earnings flexibility on the backend. This is vintage JPM and Jamie Dimon – prepare for a difficult period with a degree of conservatism and have extra reserves if the outlook pans out better than expected.', ""Price Target: $115 from NC We arrive at a price target of $115 based on the simple average of six valuation techniques (PE, price-to- book, discount dividend model, PEG ratio analysis and sum of the parts for both PE and PB).

Company-specific downside risks include higher-than-projected credit losses (especially in credit cards and home equity but also other consumer areas and commercial lending), market and interest-rate risks (which can affect JPMorgan's businesses and portfolios in a variety of ways, especially MSRs and investment securities), and operational risks (primarily associated with regulatory compliance across the firm's domestic consumer and global wholesale businesses)."", ""JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has excelled at both offense and defense over the past decade in which it has been gaining market share in all major business lines while optimizing its businesses, showing consistent earnings relative to other global banks and creating a fortress balance sheet (as defined by its CEO).

Despite the risk with a transition from optimization to growth, the result should be the greatest value creation in a decade.

It is possible that risks to the margin of the AWS business may appear over time if services become commoditized.

Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for PEP Downside risks: (1) PEP is global and the world faces many risks that could slow its category growth (COVID-related for ex) and thus, company revenue/earnings; (2) PBNA margins remaining stagnant would a\ue002ect our EPS estimates that embed improvement.

We expect the company to post a revenue growth of 21.4% YoY, its slowest revenue growth in the last 12 quarters. We expect revenue growth in 2013 decelerates to 22.2% from 26.3% in 2012, and mildly declines again in 2014. While we are fan of stocks that produce growth and have a reasonable valuation (GARP), and we can also understand the valuations paid for hyper growth companies that are nascent and chasing large markets, we see that Amazon is exhibiting slowing growth – at a spectacular price valuation, a combination we coyly call GASP. Amazon has the 17 largest valuation of the S&P500 index at $176 billion, which we mention as we see the upside is becoming more limited. The company has the largest P/E ratio at 1,415x earnings for companies in the US with a market capitalization above 25 billion. The second company is Adobe at factor lower with a P/E of 100.4x. However, Amazon is ranked 18 in revenue growth using the same criteria of US listed companies with capitalization of $25 billion or more. We see that the price investors are paying is expensive for the current level of revenue growth given the uncertainty around the degree of leverage that the company may be able to achieve. That said, we also understand the view that Amazon is going to be the next Wal-Mart, the 8 largest company on a US listed exchange, and a company that is valued at a market cap 37% above Amazon. However it may take years for Amazon to grow into this valuation fully.', 'We estimate revenue for the December quarter to be $25.8B, which is growth of 21.4% YoY.

Looking ahead, while profitability could experience some choppiness from quarter to quarter given Internet & Digital Media the timing of investments, we expect consistent revenue growth across Amazon's key business to continue to power its dominant position in both e-commerce and AWS.

Given the net revenue recognition of 3P transaction, we expect the strong growth to contribute significantly to operating income growth.', 'Subscription Services increased 56% y/y, rising to $3.1B on strength of Prime Memberships. The company recently highlighted that it had +100M Prime members. Stock Price Performance We estimate Amazon has over +125M Prime Members with ~100M in the U.S. The impact of Prime is evidenced by the rapid growth in Subscription Services. Notably, Prime members typically spend 2x, shop more frequently, and stay engaged on the platform longer than non-Prime members. Amazon announced a price increase to $119 from $99, effective May 11th, which should serve as a revenue growth catalyst in 2H18. Notably, the company now recognizes Prime subscriptions equally over 12 months, which boosts revenue in the earlier quarters, instead of recognizing a larger portion of the deferred revenue in Q4.', 'Our price target of $1,900 is based on the sum-of-the-parts analysis, which evaluates North America and International segments using an EV/Revenue multiple, and AWS segment using an EV/EBITDA multiple.

Looking at Apple’s share performance chart over the last two years, we mention that the other time that Apple has traded above the $100 mark was in September 2012. This raises the question, is the company poised to break out to new life time highs, or could shares be negatively impacted by overheated expectations and a slowing market for iPads?', 'While we remain concerned on the iPhone’s shrinking market share, which was just 11.7% worldwide in the June quarter according to IDC (Android was 84.7%), we are positive on the burgeoning service layer that the company is growing. This includes Apple Pay, iBeacons, and improvements to iAds in iOS8 that allows for retargeting consumers. While we still see iAd as a faltering business, the potential when connected with iBeacons and Apple Pay is impressive. We would like to see the company build a robust subscription streaming music (Beats) and video offering to complement its other products.', 'iPhone : We expect the company reverses the rather steep recent decline in average selling price given the product refresh and the addition of the premium priced iPhone 6+ to the product mix. We estimate 38.5M units sold at an ASP of $600 representing 56.7% of revenue. Unit volumes are growth of 13.9% YoY and 9.4% sequentially. While the iPhone is an impressive revenue and profit driver for the company, unit volume growth remains materially below the broader market which posted growth of 25.3% in the June quarter according to IDC. Our HOLD rating is driven in part by concern that the upgrade cycle for premium smartphones may elongate as the current iPhone provides the core needs for most users (fast connection speeds, biometric identification, larger screens). Faster and thinner may prove to be a less compelling reason to upgrade going forward. In our view, we are already seeing an elongation in the iPad refresh cycle. We expect the upgrade cycle for phones could also be stretched out by carrier reluctance to continue to subsidize handsets. We are currently modeling 59.5 million iPhones in the December quarter with an ASP of $655. This represents unit growth of 17% above the prior record for the company. Apple remains particularly vulnerable to posting record smashing results but having the outcome viewed as a disappointment due to overheated expectations.', 'iWatch. We are adding in the Watch to our FY2015 estimates, with 18 million units at an ASP of $500. Given the watch is not available for sale, we expect this estimate could have a wide variance.', 'Our estimate of revenue for September quarter at $40.8B is growth of 8.8% YoY and 8.9% sequentially. Our revenue estimate is above the consensus revenue of $39.8B. Our EPS estimate of $1.37 compares to $1.18 in the prior year and $1.28 in the prior Company Data quarter, and is above consensus earnings estimates of $1.30.', 'iPad: We estimate 12.1M units sold at an ASP of $440 for 13.1% of total revenue. Unit volumes are decline of 14.1% YoY and decline of 8.9% sequentially. iPod: We are modeling 2.7M units at an ASP of $160. Macintosh: We expect 4.7M units sold in the quarter at as ASP of $1300 for 15% of revenue.

We'd put a 40% probability on either of these two risks playing out in 2017 (recall that both played out in 4Q16 and it didn't seem to matter for shares, which are up almost 4.5% from the day after the print (vs S&P up 2%))."", 'Longer-term risks include the highly competitive ecommerce landscape, increasing shipping costs from same and next-day delivery, which could be a drag on margins, security breaches or frequent downtime in the AWS business which could slow down public cloud adoption, or execution missteps that could slow growth of the retail business.', 'DISCLAIMER:', 'This publication has been produced by Barclays Research Department in the Investment Bank of Barclays Bank PLC and/or one or more of its affiliates (collectively and each individually, ""Barclays"").', 'It has been prepared for institutional investors and not for retail investors.

Market Cap (m)', 'Apple’s guidance for the December quarter indicates growth in revenue and EPS, even at the low end of the range. That growth might be low single-digits, but it’s growth nonetheless for a stock that is discounting a fear of revenue and EPS declines. CEO Tim Cook also indicated that iPhone units would grow, which should be welcome news to investors after recent soft commentary from US wireless operators about upgrade rates.', 'While there are plenty of adjustments within our financial model, we continue to expect Apple to generate $10 in EPS in Fiscal 2016, reflecting 8% EPS growth, thanks to the continued aggressive share repurchase. This may be a slowdown from the 43% growth in Fiscal 2015, but we believe it should be enough to deserve a 16.0x P/E multiple and $160 price target for Apple, given the strong free cash flow conversion.', 'Over the past week, the commentary from US operators about declining phone upgrade rates was starting to concern us, but apparently China continues to chug along unabated, with mainland units growing 120% during the quarter. As we learn more about phone upgrade programs, we agree with management’s assessment that the benefit might actually be larger in future years than what they are seeing now. We also think there is an opportunity for Apple to expand its own upgrade program internationally, which could further accelerate replacement rates.', 'We maintained our estimate of 80 million iPhone units sold in the December quarter, recognizing that the US might not be as strong as we first thought. We took down our March estimate to 62.5 million units from 66 million in recognition of the potential impact of launching the iPhone into 50 markets earlier than we expected. Our new estimate reflects 2.2% unit growth in the March quarter and 5% growth for the year. We maintain our estimate of 4% ASP erosion in Fiscal 2016 as it seems implausible that Apple can continue the 5 consecutive quarters of annual iPhone ASP growth. The net impact is for slight growth in revenue for iPhones in 2016.', 'iPads continue to disappoint, declining y/y for the seventh consecutive quarter. However, the ASP outlook is improved based on the current quarter’s results and the launch of the iPad Pro. As a result, our estimate for a decline in iPad revenue was cut in half to -5% from -10% in Fiscal 2016.', 'There are several factors that have led us to increase our services revenue by $1.7 billion for Fiscal 2016. The proliferation of Apple products globally from new and used purchases is leveraging the launch of Apple Music and obvious traction in Apple Pay, which got an added boost from a new deal with American Express for international use. Our new expectation of 10% growth is in-line with the growth rate Apple delivered in Fiscal Q4 and all of Fiscal 2015, yet the dynamics for accelerating growth are clearly present.', 'While Apple does not report Apple Watch revenue or units, we estimate it sold 3.5 million in the quarter, generating $1.5 billion in revenue. We cut our Fiscal 2016 Apple Watch unit estimate by 15 million, to 35 million, resulting in a $6.3 billion negative impact to our Fiscal 2016 estimate. Those cuts were offset partially by higher revenue estimates for AppleTV and iPod refresh.', 'There is no change to our overall operating margins as a slight increase in our gross margin estimate was offset by slight increases in R&D and SG&A. Higher other income and a 30 basis point reduction in our estimated tax rate helped offset some of the operating reductions detailed above.', 'Apple bought back $13.3 billion of stock during the quarter versus our estimate of $12.5 billion. The purchases were also completed at an effective price of $109 versus our $130 estimate at the start of the quarter, resulting in 26 million more shares purchased than we estimated. This helped to offset a $1 billion reduction in our Net Income estimate based on the adjustments above.', 'Where are we versus consensus?', 'Our $3.30 FQ1 EPS estimate is at the high end of management’s implied guidance range and $0.08 above consensus going into last night’s report. Our $10 Fiscal 2016 EPS estimate is $0.20 above consensus. Our revenue estimates are $1 billion higher than consensus for FQ1 and $2.7 billion for the year.', 'Apple is converting 30% of its revenue into free cash flow, generating $70 billion of free cash flow annually. This implies an 11% FCF yield relative to its $650 billion market cap. That is simply too high of a yield given its market position, expectation of growth and high margins, regardless of the much lower level of revenue growth and EPS expectations for 2016 detailed above.', 'Even with no growth in EPS, we believe Apple’s valuation is too low based on cash generation. Apple bought back over 5% of its stock over the past year and will buy in another 6% this year if the stock remains at these levels. .

Meanwhile, potential upside to volumes (away-from-home recovery) and price/mix (given in\ue000ation at bottlers) seem plausible Marc Torrente, CFA, CPA through the year. Basically, KO is a '\ue000ex to beat' story, not a 'stretch to meet'... and we like the setup for 2022.

We go through the key bridge math below, but the general idea here is that top-line momentum is accelerating into 2022 and despite some in\ue000ation on commodities (+MSD impact to COGS), there's still a lot of \ue000ex namely on SG&A, i.e. KO seems in a position to maintain high levels of investment while still comfortably delivering the EPS outlook. Our $69 target (was $67) is on an unchanged 26.5x CY23e EPS, +40% vs SPX (historical +25% with \ue000ex to earnings)."", 'We model 2022e organic sales +7.7%, with price/mix +4.5% and REVENUE - bridge. concentrate volumes +3.2%. Our sense is KO views comps more normal now after several years of volatility, i.e. rate of top-line growth should be fairly even through the year, with potentially some modest tailwind in Q1 from slightly easier underlying comps (albeit 1 less day in Q1 o\ue001set by 1 more day in Q4 is a consideration). In our Price/mix perspective. global bottler deep-dive, we argued that bottler read-throughs implied pricing of ~5% looked reasonable so while Q421 price/mix was +10% (more about comps), we still think +4-5% is a reasonable starting point (KO noting 2022 sales should be balanced between price/mix and volume, albeit we skew more price/mix in our model).', 'The net of this is that we model GM down GROSS MARGIN - bridge - see Chart 1. -35bps y/y (was +50bps) as we now fold in BodyArmor (-80bps impact at the mid- point). Our thinking on the bridge, which we lay out in detail in Chart 1, is as follows: price/mix +175bps, channel mix (recovery of away-from-home) +95bps, commodities -200bps, FX -70bps, BodyArmor -80bps, with our model implying ~+50bps from all other (productivity and volume leverage being positives for the story in 2022 - could be higher in our view). This gets us to our 59.8% gross margin vs 60.1% in 2021. A comment on KO disclosures for the Q4 impact from BA (-70bps to GM) BodyArmor gross margins. implies that GMs were negative on our math (included one-time items); however, at 70-90bps impact to 2022, this implies BA GMs at roughly 35% for 2022 (note: BA is seen de minimis to 2022 EPS).', ""The idea here is that KO re-based its investment levels in 2021, essentially OPEX - bridge. going into 2022 with a cleaner foundation. Some context: Q4 ad spend was up nearly 50%, putting the FY21 ad spend at just over $4.0bn, i.e. up nearly 50% y/y and down only modestly from 2019 levels. Selling and distribution expenses grew +LSD in Q4, by our math ending the year at ~$2.6bn, -2% vs 2020. This implies that other expenses were up about 35% in Q4 with the FY up ~23%. Big picture: KO's 2021 momentum allowed it to return to more normal spending levels. For 2022, we model SG&A +$900mn, embedding ad spend +9% (+$380mn y/y to 10.7% vs 10.6% in 2021) with other expenses ex-stock comp +6% (+$440mn)."", 'Chart 1 - We model gross margin 59.8%, down 30bps y/y, with price and channel mix positives, o\ue000set by commodities, FX, BodyArmor.

58,59,20200616_Wells_Fargo_AMZN_AMZN-_Channel_Shift_is_Happening-_Raise_Ests-_PT_to_-3-.pdf,2020-06-16,Wells Fargo,AMZN,Amazon.com Inc.,Consumer Discretionary,"['Our review of omnichannel retailer commentary and EBAY’s upward 2Q guidance revision last week indicate to us continued strength, if not acceleration, in digital commerce from March into April and May, despite brick-and-mortar retailers beginning to reopen across much of the country. While it is too early to tell whether e-commerce penetration will permanently “ratchet” higher, strong digital demand appears likely to persist over at least the near to mid-term. While digital demand appears to have ramped aggressively, we also note omnichannel retailers have rapidly launched or expanded local fulfillment capabilities leveraging store footprints, and have so far seen an enthusiastic consumer response (e.g., TGT’s same-day services +278% YoY in its F1Q20). What does this mean for our (mostly) pure-play e-com coverage? Our view is somewhat mixed, but positive on balance: we view accelerating growth and persistence of digital demand as strong positives that likely outweigh enhanced fulfillment capabilities among omnichannel players.', 'AMZN: Raise Estimates, Raise PT to $3,000. While we note ramping local fulfillment capabilities and exceptionally strong e- commerce data pts from omnichannel retail competitors, we nonetheless expect that AMZN is likely to benefit from exceptionally strong e-commerce demand in 2Q, likely extending into 2H20. Though we view omnichannel retailers’ recent progress on BOPIS/curbside as very much worth monitoring, we believe that AMZN’s continued build-out of last-mile fulfillment capacity and a gradual return to more hectic work and school schedules among consumers will likely shift momentum back toward rapid delivery (AMZN’s 1-day Prime and Prime Now) from competitors’ store-based fulfillment options. Based on our increased forecasts and improving comparative valuations, we have raised our price target to $3,000 (23x 2021E EV/EBITDA) from $2,725 prior and maintain our Overweight rating on AMZN shares.', 'Estimate Changes. We have raised our e-commerce paid unit growth forecasts for the remainder of 2020 and 2021, and have also modeled higher 3P unit mix vs. our prior forecasts. For 2Q, we now forecast 35.5% unit growth (revised upward from +27% prior, and accelerating vs. 32% unit growth reported in 1Q20) and 54%/46% 3P/1P unit mix, consistent with 2Q19. Unit growth and 3P mix are also revised upward for 2H and, modestly, for 2021. For 2020, we now forecast revenue of $349B, GAAP Op Income of $11.4B and GAAP EPS of $15.59, vs. prior forecasts of $343B / $11.1B / $15.11. For 2021, we now forecast revenue of $415B, GAAP Op Income of $24B and GAAP EPS of $35.57 vs. our prior forecasts of $401B / $23B / $34.51.', ""Price Target: $3000 from $2725 Our valuation is based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis. Our $3,000 price target represents 23x 2021E EV/EBITDA. Risks include ongoing investment in Amazon's infrastructure (both on the AWS and Retail sides of the business), entries into new retail categories where Amazon is less experienced, competition from traditional brick and mortar players, and challenges expanding into newer international markets (such as India)."", ""We remain confident on AMZN's ability to drive penetration of additional retail product categories and key emerging geographies, maintain its lead in cloud computing and execute against additional opportunities such as online advertising (across both endemic and non-endemic advertiser categories), which we believe offer the company compelling growth and profit characteristics."", 'Amazon.com, Inc. offers services to consumers, sellers, and developers through its retail websites. It also manufactures and sells the Kindle e-reader. The Company offers programs that enable sellers to sell their products on its websites and their own branded websites. Amazon.com serves developers through Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides access to technology infrastructure that developers can use to enable any type of business. In addition, the Company generates revenue through co-branded credit card agreements and other marketing and promotional services, such as online advertising.

The super app is expected to launch in December 2020/January 2021 and will combine Tata’s consumer product offerings onto one platform (Tata’s consumer businesses include watch and jewelry brand Titan, fashion retail chain Trent, consumer durables and electronics retailer Infiniti Retail, and various key food and beverage brands). News sources indicate that the super app may be launched as a joint venture that would leverage Tata’s e- commerce business and Flipkart. Note that WMT made another $1.2 billion investment in Flipkart in July, roughly two years after purchasing an almost 80% stake in 2018 for $16 billion. It’s clear that some initial operational and regulatory challenges have not deterred the company’s interest in this massive market. We view the news as mixed for now. While a path to value creation in Flipkart looks to be evolving positively given the potential for a future IPO, and we applaud management’s willingness to think outside the box (TikTok is another example here), doubling down on this complicated market is not without risk. Further assessment is difficult without more details. We continue to rate WMT Equal Weight.', 'Price Target: $130 from NC Our $130 price target reflects 25x our NTM earnings estimate. We see numerous upside and downside risks to our Equal Weight rating/target. 1.) Continued progress in digital could earn greater credibility with investors and a higher valuation. 2.) International divestitures would be positive for returns and the stock. 3.) Traffic and comps could slow as in-store initiatives mature, putting pressure on the stock. 4.) Margins could fall by more than expected if digital losses grow, competition intensifies, and costs rise.', ""WMT has made strong progress in its repositioning against high initial skepticism, and the pace of change should be applauded. The company has essentially turned itself into Amazon's biggest on-line retail competitor while returning its stores to positive traffic growth. We have been impressed with the effort, but simply cannot get behind the stock after its recent run given that structural issues still loom large. E- commerce risk is shifting to food/consumables, hard discount poses a threat, traditional competitors are beginning to fight harder, and the cost of doing business in retail continues to rise. We also find it difficult to ignore the fact that WMT still operates 700 million sq. ft. of selling space (3x its closest peer) at a time when retail is under siege, and is the country's largest grocery store during the most challenging period in the industry's history. As we assess the company's progress against our concerns and the stock's improved valuation, the risk/reward appears balanced at current levels."", 'Walmart, Inc. is the world\'s largest retailer, operating stores in various formats around the world and providing a broad assortment of merchandise and services at every day low prices (""EDLP"").

We expect the company to modestly beat on both revenue and profitability, driven by a strong holiday season, continued strength in AWS, as well as rapidly growing advertising revenue. We reiterate our BUY rating and increase our Expect modest upside on 4Q17 revenue. PT to $1,600 based on sum-of-the-parts analysis on FY18 estimates. Internet & Digital Media We expect 4Q17 revenue to come in at the high end of guidance and ahead of Street expectations due to a strong holiday season both on macro and micro level. We estimate total revenue of $59.9B vs. guidance of $56-60.5B and consensus of $59.7B. Our estimate consists of $37.5B N.

E-commerce continued to grow faster than broader retail, which, according to Adobe, increased 14.6% y/y, also ahead of prior forecast of 13.8%. NetElixir, a search marketing agency who analyzed e-commerce traffic data, estimated 13% y/y increase in holiday e-commerce sales, above its 10% initial Strong Prime growth. projection.', ""We believe Prime continued to be key driver in driving revenue for the company. Amazon added more than 4 million Prime members in one week over the holiday season, above 3M that join over the same period last year. We believe Amazon adds at least 5M Prime members/quarter. Amazon doesn't disclose Higher conversion rate. total count, but CIRP's latest estimate points to 90 million members in U.S. alone."", 'Amazon also leads other retailers in terms of conversion rate.

The top line performed well with a US comp that was about expected. EBIT margin expanded Anthony Bonadio, CFA in the quarter, with a surprisingly strong US gross margin o\ue001setting higher-than- expected omicron costs. 2022 guidance of EPS growth of 5-6% was relatively good, but the cadence (down low-double digits in Q1/up high teens in Q4) is likely to leave residual questions. Overall, we came away positive from the update, but would note that broader macro risk remains. The company does look well positioned to see trade down, management seemed to express comfort with its ability to manage in\ue002ation given its price gaps, and alternative pro\ue000t streams like advertising are growing.

EPS of $1.53 beat the consensus expectation of $1.50 and our $1.48. Q4 Highlights: Top-line beat as both demand and in\ue002ation remained strong, but was driven largely by the Sam's Club banner. US comp growth of 5.6% was in line with consensus, a touch ahead of guidance, and was paced by transaction growth of 3.1% and ticket growth of 2.4%. Costs remained a challenge (supply chain and wages), but were o\ue001set with price management, mix, and lower COVID costs. All-in, the US business EBIT margin deleveraged 27bps on GM expansion and opex deleverage. International sales grew by 6.4% excluding the impact of recent divestitures, driven by strength in Mexico, China, and Flipkart.

The company has essentially turned itself into Amazon's biggest online retail competitor while returning its stores to positive tra\ue003c growth. Overall, we have been impressed with the e\ue001ort. Though the company lost share during COVID, we expect momentum to reaccelerate given normalizing consumer behavior, tailwinds from monthly CTC payments, and easier comparisons relative to other retail peers. While concerns around investment and the magnitude of medium-term growth remain, WMT looks like a good name to own in consumer at the moment. We rate WMT shares Overweight. Target Price Valuation for WMT: $165.00 from NC Our $165 price target re\ue002ects 25x our 2022 earnings estimate. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for WMT Risks include: 1) Tra\ue003c/comps could slow as in-store initiatives mature. Some COVID-related behavior could stick, causing consumers to prefer local grocers. 2) Food cost in\ue002ation could pressure margins if pass-through becomes di\ue003cult. 3) Higher digital mix could permanently dilute the company's margin pro\ue000le if e\ue001orts to curb losses through improved ful\ue000llment, automation, technology, etc. are unsuccessful. 4) Ongoing cost pressure (e.g., labor, freight) could o\ue001set top-line gains. 5) The company operates in an intensely competitive environment.""]",165.00,Overweight

In calendar 2Q20 (Figure 1), WMT lost 3.1% of its market share when we include AMZN in the dataset and lost', '2.2% of its market share when we exclude AMZN.', 'This was a meaningful reversal from calendar 1Q20 (Figure 2) when WMT had considerable share gains of 4.4%, and', '4.7% including and excluding AMZN, or 107 bps and 117 bps including and excluding AMZN respectively. We believe the', 'convenience factor of going to a local grocer instead of a potentially further away more crowded big box may have', 'contributed to this share loss in 2Q. Additionally as this is $ market share, the 2Q share loss could also be very much', 'explained by WMT’s EDLP strategy – as competitors ceased all promotions and benefited from higher throughput, while', 'WMT obviously retained its EDLP go-to-market strategy. We do, however, acknowledge the gap to TGT is surprising – and', 'will look for more color on this when both companies report next week.', 'As you can see in the consolidated calendar 1H20 Figure 3 below, WMT’s share levels increased 1.2% excluding AMZN', 'and increased 0.6% including AMZN. Looking at changes in bps share, excluding AMZN, WMT increased its aggregate', 'share in these categories by 32 bps in 1H20, but gains were a more muted 15bp when we include AMZN. Excluding', 'AMZN, we acknowledge share gains were more muted than TGT, DG and Publix, and also acknowledge the bricks and', 'mortar Walmart lost share (made up for by e-commerce), but in this omni-channel world, we care about total share –', 'especially for Walmart given its dominance in pick-up and on-line. We would also highlight the fact that the Kroger', 'banner lost more share than Walmart – although in the bricks and mortar world – this was made up for by the other', 'banners. Excluding AMZN, ACI gained less share than WMT and KR – at only 13bp, although as a % change in total share,', 'ACI outpaced WMT. Based on our analysis – at ACI, many banners lost share including: Jewel-Osco, ACME, and Shaws.', 'While the 2Q20 share loss for WMT could worry some, we see it as transitory and point to 1Q20 (and overall 1H20) share', 'gains as proof that WMT’s long term strategy of “being there for the customer” will win in the end.', 'With respect to the scanner data, as you can see in Figure 4 below , Nielsen store scanner data does show $', 'sales growth in the conventional “Food” channel (conventional grocers) outpacing the “Other” Multi-Outlet Stores (i.e.', 'Mass, Club, Dollar etc.). The y/y dollar sales growth gap between these channels is ~12pts since the outbreak of COVID-', '19. However, we believe two nuances in interpreting the data help explain some of the gap. First, we believe', 'that conventional grocers have pulled promotions more significantly and/or taken more pricing during the pandemic,', 'while WMT has been investing in price despite inflation – so higher prices by conventionals is a factor, in our view.', 'Second, price increases at conventional combined with higher utilization (i.e. the assets were previously very', 'underutilized), by definition will lead to higher dollar growth at the conventions. Third , the Nielsen data does not capture', 'e-commerce delivery data for retailers such as Walmart – and e-commerce is a significant growth driver for WMT, rising', 'To be clear, we acknowledge the validity of some industry data-points, as there are logical reasons why WMT sales may', 'be lagging other grocers and some of WMT’s vendors have discussed share loss. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that', 'there are a lot of poorly managed, low productivity, grocery retailers that likely benefited significantly', 'more from COVID-related demand. Simply by virtue of carrying highly demanded goods in a potentially less', 'frequented (and perhaps closer geographically in some cases) format, these grocers may have increased sales at a very', 'fiscal stimulus). None of this is sustainable, however, in our view.', 'To conclude: the evidence on market share reflects losses for WMT in 2Q, but what we are sure of is that WMT’s', 'competitors did not improve as merchants/operators so markedly overnight . Nor will the consumers’ current', 'disregard for price and/or the potential fear of contagion in big box stores last very long (if that is, in fact, what we are', 'witnessing). As noted above, Figure 3 shows the “Other” Multi-Outlet Stores (i.e. Mass, Club, Dollar etc.) growth lagging', 'during COVID, but look at the consistent share gains in the “Other” channel pre-COVID dating back to 2016. We think', 'such multi-year gains in the mass channel (i.e. WMT) speak to the enduring strength of WMT’s model. Conversely,', 'inferior retailers will lose any near-term share gains quickly, while retailers (such as WMT) that provide value and', 'convenience (with a superior omni-channel platform) while positively engaging customers/communities will benefit from', 'stickier sales growth. That customer stickiness is the post-COVID prize, in our view.', 'We are forecasting 2Q U.S. comps of 5% vs. consensus of 5.7%, industry data points seem to range from', '4.5%-8%. Recall that WMT said it had a “solid” start to May driven by fiscal stimulus. General merchandise categories', 'were likely boosted by government payments, while grocery clearly remained elevated industry-wide given the shift to', 'FAFH to FAH, as reads from KR and ACI suggest high teens May/June industry growth. Notably, we look forward to more', 'Key Topic #2 - Margin Considerations: Investments and COVID-19 related costs will continue to limit flow-through in', 'the near-term. We expect margins to once again be pressured in 2Q given a) “hero pay” in the U.S., b) continued', 'inflation (a move which will be “remembered” by customers, in our view), as well as e) weakness in International. As a', 'reminder, most of Walmart’s International markets lag by 1 month from a reporting perspective so April, May, and June', 'results will be factored into 2Q results vs. May, June, and July for the U.S. and Canada. April was an especially difficult', 'month for International markets, which, for example, saw COVID related store closures in South Africa, and severe', 'government limitations on what was allowed to be sold in India. As stated earlier, we wouldn’t rule out a more aggressive', 'With respect to COVID related costs in more detail, management noted that it would be reasonable to assume 2Q costs', 'similar to 1Q’s ~$900M in incremental costs ($670M in the U.S.). While WMT noted that its second round of associate', 'bonuses of ~$370M would impact 2Q, in late July, the company then announced another $428M in bonuses that will be', 'paid out on Aug. 20 . It is unclear if these bonus payments will be expensed on the P&L in 2Q or 3Q, although we', 'believe our modeled y/y SG&A increase of $1.2B in 2Q has enough cushion to absorb the third payment.', 'The sustainability of high labor costs will be a topic of focus on the call, but investors will also focus on the', 'degree to which WMT has improved efficiencies/operations. As we explain in more detail below, recent news that', 'WMT is eliminating “hundreds” of jobs (in store planning, logistics, and duplicative merchandising) reflects the ongoing', 'sales leverage should drive better e-commerce profitability. We note, although WMT did eliminate jobs at corporate, the', 'company has also hired ~400k employees at the store level during the pandemic to meet higher demand.', 'Overall, we are forecasting a 46 bps drop in Walmart Inc. operating margins in 2Q, including a 30 bps', 'decline in the U.S. Consensus is at down 30 bps.', 'Key Topic #3 - Recent Restructuring Actions/Leadership Changes: As alluded to above, recently made some', 'changes at the corporate level to eliminate redundant or less productive positions. Some investors have read these', 'moves as a cost cutting exercise in the face of slowing sales growth. We believe the moves reflect the continued', 'more agile, efficient, and nimble organization. We do not believe that the restructuring has anything to do with', 'recent sales trends or, more specifically, the grocery share loss narrative described above. Many of the job cuts are', 'operations, which was already discussed/announced, but hadn’t yet been acted on in terms of consolidating', 'roles/functions – largely because COVID meant “all hands on deck” for the better part of the last 4 months.', 'With respect to leadership, we believe the recent departure of Sean Slovenski, former SVP of Health and', 'Wellness at Walmart U.S. is also an extension of U.S. CEO John Furner putting his imprint on the business,', 'specifically the health and wellness opportunity. Mr. Slovenski’s departure has been cited by some as a sign of', 'turmoil at WMT in the midst of slowing sales/share loss. However, we suspect the change may be a function of Mr.', 'Key Topic #4 – Recent E-commerce Developments: Two important topics are top of mind regarding Walmart’s e-', 'commerce business and will likely garner attention on the 2Q call: 1) news about the “Walmart+” rollout, and 2) news', 'With respect to “Walmart+”: press reports have surfaced that Walmart planned to launch the “Walmart+” program in', 'July – a program which would enable unlimited same day delivery of grocery and other goods from Supercenters along', 'We believe the program has been in the budget for some time now and see this as the natural progression of the', 'Walmart Delivery Unlimited program which WMT began testing in November of last year. Delivery Unlimited was being', 'tested in ~1,600 stores covering ~50% of the population. According to press reports, while COVID pushed back the initial', 'launch timeframe of March/April into July, the press has speculated the launch has been delayed again, fueling', 'speculation about soft U.S. sales trends causing the delay. We believe any delay is more a function of the need to', 'continue to navigate the ongoing COVID crisis, and not related to top line trends. More importantly,', 'traction with the subscription model could go a long way in extending the moat around Walmart’s business', 'given WMT’s positioning in grocery and unique assets. We are hopeful more details will emerge on the 2Q call, but', 'also suspect a delay – if there even is one – could be tied to Instacart – even though it is apparently only in test mode.', 'With respect to Instacart: On August 11th, CNBC reported (and quoted an “Instacart spokesperson”) that Walmart', 'would launch a pilot with Instacart in 4 markets across California and Oklahoma. On one hand , since 2015, WMT has', 'proven its culture is always open to change – but before any final decision is made, WMT follows a disciplined and', 'deliberate testing strategy. This could be just a test. On the other hand , we were surprised. While we are not privy to', 'any details regarding the test (data sharing, fee structure, for example), we have for some time applauded WMT for', 'building out its own end-to-end solution vs. most other grocers’ reliance on Instacart. Our position is that retailers who', 'have the scale to build out their own end-to-end e-commerce solution should do so given the benefits from data assets,', 'inventory visibility, customer/vendor relationships, and eventual cost optimization. As such, it is unclear to us what to', 'We are forecasting 2Q21 EPS of $1.16 vs. consensus of $1.25. WMT has pivoted its focus on making the necessary', 'investments to serve its customers and workers during the pandemic.

SG&A stayed in check, and EPS beat handily (first take). 2022 seems a wrap with a doable Q4 (guide implies investment), Joe Lachky, CFA with the PEP story now firmly on 2023, in our view. Here, the shape of results will be different — pricing to counteract commodity/FX/other inflation will remain, but much less so vs 2022; PEP will need to slow the rate of SG&A increases relative to recent years, Marc Torrente, CFA, CPA unless it over-delivers on organic sales again; and, the company will be lapping the benefit of an extra week in N. America in Q4. Scope of beats may narrow with multiple expansion tougher. That said, PEP has its hands firmly on the wheel of its own destiny here. Evan Greenblatt FY22e/FY23e EPS is +$0.08/$0.07 to $6.75/$7.23, on higher sales (Q3 Raise estimates. over-delivery, raising Q4), with margins in both years generally unchanged.', 'We go up $2 to $174, flowing higher EPS on unchanged 24x CY23e EPS Raise target. (past 3/5/10/20yr NTM P/E avg 23.9/22.7/20.1/19.6x). We stay Equal Weight — PEP is demonstrating its qualities and will likely prove an outlier this EPS season. Upside seems to depend on multiple expansion, however, more difficult in this market.', 'This should wrap into 2023, and we Confirmation on incremental pricing in Q422. expect pricing to remain the key driver of organic sales growth (even if lesser vs 2022). We model 2023 organic sales +6% y/y with pricing +5% and volume +1%.', 'Commodity inflation was a -42% headwind to op profit Inflation likely to carry into FY23. in Q3, or a 14.5% impact to COGS. Based on our commodity model, we see +11.8%/+4.8% to COGS in FY22/FY23 — i.e., inflation slowing in FY23, but not reversing. PEP hedges 6-9 months ahead, so most of the FY23 commodity bucket is unhedged.', 'We updated our GM bridge (see herein) and This will temper gross margin expansion. continue to model FY23 gross margin expansion +25bps. Drivers: price/mix +220bps, volume leverage +10bps, FX -20bps, productivity +60bps, commodities -220bps, other -30bps. Recall: our model assumes pricing offsets commodities in $, but not on margin.', 'We think PEP will need to manage SG&A SG&A increases will need to slow into 2023. a bit tighter to hit our +7% EPS growth in 2023 (~+9.5% ex FX). Perspective: we model SG&A +1.9% in FY23, which is below the +7.5% CAGR since 2018 (see note). Key FY23 assumptions: distribution costs +5% (even with DSD labor inflation currently running +MSD-HSD, so that may prove aggressive), ad spend/R&D/share-based comp +2.8% (all flat as % of sales), with ""other SG&A"" -2.5% (all much slower vs recent trends). Should FY23 SG&A grow +7.5%, PEP would need another +2pts of top-line growth vs our model to keep earnings unchanged (i.e., over deliver on organic sales algorithm - not out of the question, but something to monitor).', 'Due to timing of its fiscal year-end, PEP will benefit from 53rd week headwind in FY23. an extra week in North America in Q422. Recall this is expected to mitigate the FY22 earnings dilution from the Tropicana divestiture. The calendar shifts back to 52 weeks in FY23. Unmitigated, this is a 1-2pt headwind to FY23 EPS growth. This dynamic in N. America last happened in Q416 (extra week benefit) and Q417 (headwind from one less week).', 'Exhibit 3 - Commodities were a -42pt headwind to op. profit in Exhibit 4 - ... which translates to a 12.9% impact to COGS Q322...', 'Exhibit 5 - The headwind from commodities worsened in Q3 in 6 of 7 segments', ""Investment Thesis PEP results have been resilient amidst COVID; and with a consistent algorithm and valuation in line with historicals, we expect the stock to track the group. We carry a positive lean and recognize the case that could drive earnings catalysts. We simply need time to assess if these scenarios become reality, namely PBNA, and view EPS expectations as reasonable for now, hence the Equal Weight rating. Target Price Valuation for PEP: $174.00 from $172.00 Our $174 price target is based on a 24x P/E multiple to our CY23 EPS estimate. This is a +50% premium to SPX vs. historically +25%, reflecting PEP's defensive qualities in the current macro backdrop, but below other large-cap peers with better visibility on earnings. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for PEP Downside risks include (1) PEP is global and the world faces many risks that could slow its category growth (COVID-related for ex) and thus, company revenue/earnings; (2) PBNA margins remaining stagnant would affect our EPS estimates that embed improvement. Upside risks include: (1) PBNA margins accelerating could drive upside to earnings, and (2) a faster global recovery, which would drive PEP's foodservice business.""]",0.07,Equal

Leveraging key learnings through the crisis, CEO James Quincey outlined a new set of 5 strategic priorities (replacing the ones introduced at CAGNY in February), three of which we highlight below:', 'With the next three years presenting a very different reality than what would have been', 'anticipated just a few months ago, KO is accelerating existing efforts to optimize its portfolio…I t’s been nearly 3 years since Mr. Quincey first discussed the concept of eliminating “zombies” with the Street – shutting down sub-scale, underperforming', 'brands/SKUs soaking up critical resources that could be better allocated towards brands with building momentum.

In this regard, it would seem KO isn’t going to let the current crisis go to waste and is redoubling efforts to streamline the', 'portfolio. Recall, KO and other CPGs have tactically narrowed assortment through the peak of the lockdown periods in order to ease pressure on supply chains and minimize out of stocks for key SKUs. We’d think the background work enabling these moves similarly', 'yielded the realization of just how fat the tail had become, with the recent decision to discontinue Odwalla being case in point.', '…whilst introducing greater discipline into innovation and marketing such that the company can support its growth ambitions more efficiently… To improve the odds of', 'success for “explorer” and “challenger” brands, KO is raising the bar on its innovation pipeline, shifting focus to bigger, more targeted bets in new growth avenues (eg. AHA sparkling which has achieved double-digit value share in the U.S. in its first 18 weeks on the', 'market). Additionally, while the conversation on marketing in recent months has been more in the way of near-term tactical cuts or delays in spend to offset volume deleverage, Mr. Quincey discussed longer-term opportunities to improve marketing effectiveness and', 'efficiency that we believe could drive more lasting benefits to the P&L.

That said, with the crisis breeding opportunity to collaborate more closely with struggling food-service/restaurant operators and accelerating e-commerce adoption in the industry, KO also discussed efforts to', 'capitalize on changing channel dynamics. To this point, we heard several examples of new partnerships in the on-premise channel to support a recovery in its customer base (eg. a new “Open Like Never Before” campaign behind re-openings in Europe, a rapid response', 'resource for food-service outlets in the U.S., touchless FreeStyle machines).

Period-end securities rose by $24b this qtr and mgmt signaled additional purchases were possible. However, a material increase in the securities book still seems unlikely with rates at current levels as JPM views the long term return as being too low.', 'That said, JPM has a ton of dry powder to add securities over time if rates rise and/or they change their view on rates. On today\'s call, we asked how much this could be if rates rise to a level that mgmt felt comfortable would generate a good long term return. JPM noted it could ""easily"" deploy $200b of cash into securities.', 'This $200b compares to nearly $600b of excess deposit growth since 4Q19 (ie before COVID and related central bank actions). We define excess deposit growth as the change in deposits (of $840b vs. a combined $244b increase in loans + securities). Recall that mgmt has previously acknowledged that some of the deposit growth over this period is noncore/less sticky as system liquidity is reduced over time/rates rise.', '$200b of liquidity deployment can add nearly 20% to EPS with rates at 3%', 'Deutsche Bank does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports.

RMBS spreads remain around current levels (of 50bps) and JPM deploys the full $200b. These are a lot of ifs, but this helps illustrate the potential earnings upside from deploying excess liquidity. As noted in the prior section, the earnings leverage outlined just above from deploying excess liquidity is in addition to the rate leverage disclosed in JPM's 10Q. Recall that as of 6/30, a 100bp rise in rates would boost JPM's (2022) net income by 15%."", 'Other tidbits from the call Mgmt noted expenses would increase in 2022 vs. 2021, even though capital markets related revenue (and related comp) would likely be lower. This is higher than the flattish costs assumed in consensus for 2022 prior to today, but also not a huge surprise given expense pressure at JPM and across the banking industry. On the call, JPM noted the likely higher costs in 2022 reflected continued inflationary pressures and investment spend. We previously assumed flat costs and now assume a 1-2% rise.', ""Mgmt acknowledged that FY22 net II guidance implied a $300m-plus increase in 4Q21 vs. 3Q. However, JPM cautioned not to run rate the implied $13.5b given seasonal boosts from markets/trading and one time benefits from PPP. Looking out to 1Q, there's also day count adjustments to make. This caused some market concern that consensus FY22 net II expectations (of $55.1b) may be too high. However, we'd point out that mgmt was also upbeat about card growth in 2022 and as discussed above has already started to deploy some liquidity into securities."", 'Accounting for all this, our 1Q22 net II estimate is $13.1b and our FY22 estimate is $55.8b.', 'Card fees: In the Consumer Bank, card fees were $651m in 3Q vs. $1.2b in 2Q. Mgmt noted on the call that the sequential decline was primarily due to higher marketing/acquisition costs and due to a $180m adjustment to rewards liabilities. The adjustment is considered a one time event while marketing costs are expected to continue and be slightly higher in 4Q.', 'On loan growth, mgmt noted it has seen some recovery across lending products including the following: For card, mgmt noted faster spend down of excess deposits for customers who are generally inclined to revolve and believe card outstandings should grow in 2022.', 'In home lending, mgmt expects portfolio additions to outpace prepayments in 4Q (similar to 3Q trends).', 'For C&I, mgmt noted that utilization rates had a little bit of an uptick among smaller corporates.', 'In CRE, mgmt noted robust origination pipelines and have removed any pandemic-related pullbacks in credit and expect to see a little bit of net loan growth going forward.', ""Mgmt also noted expected loan growth in markets but noted it's"", 'FICC trading: In the earnings materials, it was noted that the current qtr included an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio. Mgmt noted that while FICC declined 20% yoy (on a reported basis), ex the adjustment, FICC declined 15%.

Yet, the jury may remain out given the risks, Christopher Spahr and we publish this note ahead of our meeting with the CIO tomorrow to give investors a chance to give us their concerns, too. Based on JPM's investor day, our takeaways are that spending at JPM is a microcosm of greater spending generally, potentially aiding Robert Rutschow tech players such as PATH, MSFT, CRM, CFLT (covered by Wells Fargo's software analyst Michael Turrin, who has previously published on these companies)."", ""JPM's tech moves may enhance its Seeking leadership in the innovation economy: Hayden Girard, CFA non-replicable global financial leadership long term, but leave investors wanting more evidence of success in the short term. Outstanding questions are whether its push to be the leading financial firm in the innovation economy is worth sacrificing est. 15-20% EPS annually with discretionary spend, and the degree to which JPM can effectively manage its record tech spend."", ""JPM's investor day reinforced that JPM wants to become the first and best (1) All in. global Digital Bank 2.0, which we define as transcending traditional banking by providing previously unavailable products, services, insights, and engagement.

Managerially, it is tough to monitor paybacks from tech investments. Operating risk gets amplified by the level of JPM's “technical debt”, complexity, and franchise breadth. Execution risk increases since JPM is pursuing so many initiatives at the same time."", 'JPM seems excited about its pursuit to become the first dominant 2.0 Digital Bank. Yet, this also carries risks. The picture below sums up our thoughts—diving off a cliff into the water reflects that there is no turning back from a generational change in core banking systems. This is necessitated by the goal to provide Big Tech-type, front-end customer experiences and services.', ""For most of the last decade, JPM's ability to change its Digital Banking 1.0 has been good for JPM. banking services from analog to digital—or relatively more to bots from bankers—has aided JPM's improvement in both market share and efficiency. Tech at JPM has worked well—over the past seven years, JPM has shown strong, tech-enabled positive operating leverage, and relative stock price outperformance vs. the SPX and BKX (up 2.8x vs. 2.3x and 2.0x)."", ""JPM's new phase of its corporate life cycle is that it seeks to build a better Digital Banking 2.0 is now. mousetrap by providing new functionality in digital form that was previously unavailable, whereby the experience transcends traditional banking functions.

Our firm's software analyst gives a framework in his Software analyst gives framework for analysis previously published work—moats, automation, and data (“MAD about software”)—for discussing software firms which can apply to JPM, as follows:"", ""1. JPM has made it clear that it can spend whatever it takes, and believes it has the scale Moats. as the No.1 bank to do so. JPM's tech spending in 2022 alone equals the total expenses of the eighth largest bank and ranks among the top few of all industries. JPM's goal and potential is to provide superior, homegrown differentiated products, platforms, and experiences, with seamless multichannel delivery, transitioning from “share of wallet” to “share of life” experiences. One clear example of expansion far beyond traditional banking is its acquisition of restaurant guide Zagat."", ""2. . To meet JPM's customer targets, another key goal is to modernize its infrastructure Automation and further its scalability with more bots relative to bankers.

JPM also seeks to unlock the power of its data, which includes 500 petabytes of data Data. (for context, the Library of Congress has under 25 petabytes of data).

An overriding objective is for cybersecurity everywhere and all the time.', ': The key question is whether the pace of accelerating, record tech Risks with the new transformation investments is faster than its ability to effectively manage, similar to the past. Several risks abound as follows:', 'A key question is whether JPM is pursuing . It is Management risk: too much at the same time pursuing the expansion of 14 tech-related deals and strategic investments over the past two years, launching a consumer bank outside the US for the first time (the UK and Brazil are only a start), transitioning the core banking system to the Cloud, and even acting as a first mover to the Metaverse.', 'The decision of if and when to cut losses (as it did with FINN) or invest more (as with US consumer digital banking) can be a tough one. Indeed, in the opening remarks at JPM’s May 2022 investor day, CEO Jamie Dimon said that tech success can be “hard to measure at times”—which means it is even harder for those of us on the outside to have visibility toward progress.', 'The strategic question is whether this is an effective grand plan that pieces together historical investment and other spending, with dozens of transactions to reinforce leadership for the next decade or, as relayed to us by investors, whether this is a new type of empire building built on top of past success but only to push too much.', 'First, the transition to new systems and esp. the Cloud (half of JPM’s infrastructure Operating risk: spending) has typically come with more costs, complexity and time than initially thought. Second, acquisitions have their own items, especially expansion of digital banking in the crowded UK market. Third, the level of “technical debt” is greater than previously realized.', ""To get to Digital Banking 2.0, JPM needs to have a more modernized back office and reduce it's higher than previously known level of apps (6400) and data centers (37), which it intends and needs to do. These are necessary steps to achieve more real-time processing with greater amounts of data to better service customers. Indeed, JPM mentioned “technical debt” on its 4Q21 earnings call for the first time ever."", 'The adage “better late than never” applies since JPM has known about the strategic threat —its 2014 annual report proclaimed that “ Silicon Valley is Coming ”—and is now taking more forceful actions, given Big Tech knocking at the door and sometimes getting in.', 'What’s new is the degree that JPM is willing to sacrifice returns in order to gain Financial risk: share, given the highest increase in tech spending and total expenses in the company’s history. JPM’s record $14B of tech spending raises the question whether any bank can spend this amount of money wisely, esp. given a discretionary portion ($7B) that is more than 2x above the $2-3B level from 2008-2017.', 'This leads to certain, front-loading of expenses for less certain back end benefits. We forecast the worst three years of operating leverage in the firms modern history (2021-2023). Indeed, inflation has already increased the amount of discretionary investments post 2Q22 results.', ""Much depends on the effectiveness of overseers to ensure financial discipline, though there have been changes in the role of CFO for the firm and in three of the four business lines.

In some ways, JPM looks like others, since all large US banks have a hybrid, multiple Cloud approach (JPM uses AWS, Google, and Microsoft), with seemingly more activities on the front-end than the back-end.', 'We suspect that JPM is in the industry-trend ballpark for doubling Cloud workloads to 15% YoY. This is based on a survey by Accenture of 150 global banks. Yet, unlike some others, JPM seems unable to shoot for “zero ops” (no data systems) given its status as a systemically critical firm.', ""Embracing core banking conversion.

For example, State Street is a cautionary tale; its tech transformation this decade led to a worse pre-tax margin due to complexity, cost, difficulty, and time (per its board’s lead director). Many JPM efforts probably have no payback, though some have an ROI of 2x, and recent investor day presentations noted five or so year payback periods (consumer, non-US consumer).', 'First, digitization creates new risks, and JPM’s cyber spend seems defensive to Governance: protect against what might be the No.1 risk to banking. While JPM and other large banks seem to have greater resilience, they are more exposed given a larger attack surface. Second, JPM had used tech to improve share and efficiency over most of last decade, but the new risk is the greater willingness to accept negative operating leverage for market share. There are 4 CIOs for JPM’s 4 business lines, and then there is also the firm’s CIO who oversees tech for the entire firm. While there are synergies by business line, the ability to coordinate activities across business lines does not seem easy.', 'Investment Thesis JPMorgan Chase (rated Equal Weight) has excelled at both offense and defense over the past decade in which it has been gaining market share in all major business lines while optimizing its businesses, showing consistent earnings relative to other global banks, and creating a ""fortress balance sheet"" (as defined by its CEO). Playing defense has carried more importance over the past few years; however, greater offense is expected to play a role as JPM continues to invest long term. This issue is certain to us: front-loaded spending in the near term for less certain back-ended benefits. JPM continues to reflect our “Goliath is Winning” theme, but the cost and time frame for doing so are greater and longer than expected. Moreover, JPM is more expensive than the average bank at a time when other banks are more pure plays on our 2022 theme (“NII to the Sky”). Target Price Valuation for JPM: $118.00 from NC We arrive at a price target of $118, which implies 9.8x our 2023E EPS and 1.6x price-to-tangible book value, based on the simple average of six valuation techniques (PE, price-to-book, discount dividend model, PEG ratio analysis and sum of the parts for both P/E and P/B). The 20-year forward P/E for JPM has averaged 14x, and the median was 12x; PTB avg. 1.8x over the past decade. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for JPM Macro downside risk factors include a slowdown in global economic activity, greater-than-expected increases in unemployment and bankruptcies (in the US and abroad), and adverse changes in US and foreign laws and regulations. Company-specific downside risks include higher-than-projected credit losses (especially in credit cards and home equity but also other consumer areas and commercial lending), market and interest-rate risks (which can affect JPMorgan\'s businesses and portfolios in a variety of ways, especially MSRs and investment securities), and operational risks (primarily associated with regulatory compliance across the firm\'s domestic consumer and global wholesale businesses). Risks to the upside include higher rates with a steeper yield (helps traditional banking revenue), with no commensurate negative impact on capital markets activities (advisory, underwriting, trading) and a stronger than expected recovery (resulting in stronger-than-expected loan growth).']",118.00,Equal

JPM guides for 8% higher expenses in 2022 due to in\ue001ation/comp/T&E normalization (40%) and deliberate increases in investments (60%), implying a second year in a row of negative operating leverage. While JPM indicated that it intended to gain market share in each business, it gave few other concrete metrics around future expectations even though investments (targeted $15bn in 2022) are set to increase by 30% YoY and by 57% since 2019.', ""The degree of downside Big reduction to estimates given company-speci\ue000c moves. to our estimates is a surprise to us after reviewing our earnings model.

The decline in our PT follows our est. revision downward."", ""We don't see how the math works otherwise with the increase in expenses this year, especially since JPM gave no assurance that expenses would not continue to increase after 2022.

Net-net, we est. 2022E revenue to be up 1% while expenses are up 8% (core).

Indeed, a mid-teens ROTCE is still decent. Nonetheless, at a time when most banks should show improving pre-tax pro\ue000t margins, JPM is likely to go in the opposite direction over the next 1-2 years.

This includes $4 billion to repurchase 31.2 million shares in open market transactions in the June quarter, and $90 billion in total share repurchases since the start of the capital return program. While the market is starting to express concerns over Apple’s dependency on the iPhone, and growth in the China market, we mention two other items.', '1) Services. Apple makes wonderful hardware and has nicely integrated it with a software operating system. Its other software products and services layer can be considered merely adequate, in our opinion. Does anyone really love using iTunes? Do you truly consider the App store a polished product with curated suggestions that can’t be improved? Have you compared Siri to Google Now? Music may have millions of customers take the free trial, but given the resources that Apple has – isn’t it a bit disappointing to have a product that is similar to others already on the market? Given the excitement over a potential TV bundle, should we expect a break out product given the recent launches? Why can’t Apple build up an advertising revenue stream? And finally, and what point does owning the platform increase the regulatory risk to the company as it uses pricing power and the App store to its own advantage? 2) Growth. We are modeling growth on a year-over-year basis to slow starting in the December quarter of 2016. We are not factoring in revenue from new products that are not announced such as TV, but we are factoring in an iPhone and iPad refresh.

Shares have traded anywhere from 6% to 14% on earnings, with the stock trading up 4 of the last eight quarters.', 'We mention that if we take our 2017 revenue estimate of $158 billion, and generously apply a 10% margin, followed by a 25% tax rate (also generous), and divide by the 487 million shares we estimate, this is $24.33 in EPS. Using a stock price of $735/share, that EPS gives a 30x multiple for a company that is growing revenue 16% YoY . The point of this exercise is to show that even if the company was able to obtain a 10% overall margin profile, one could view that the valuation is already reflected at current share price levels.', 'Regarding AWS, our estimates are revenue of $2.7B with margin of 28%, revenue growth of 50% YoY and 9% of total revenue. We see risks to growth slowing and profitability being reduced via a combination of competition, price cuts and overall service commoditization. If one were to assign the value of Walmart to Amazon’s retail operations, approximately $228B, that would leave $119B in value for Amazon’s remaining businesses, which are primarily AWS. While we respect the growth and margin profile of AWS, it is subject to commoditization risk and a valuation of over $100 billion at its current level seems more than reasonable. CEO Jeff Bezos is reported to have used the line “Your profit is my opportunity”, and we mention that AWS competition may seek to flip this around on Mr. Bezos by using price as a lever to win business.', 'We estimate revenue for the June quarter to be $29.2B, which is growth of 26% YoY and 0.2% sequentially.
