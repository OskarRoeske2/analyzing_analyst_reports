After falling minus 5.3 percent shortly after the start of Xetra trading and hitting a nine-week low, they recently gained 0.6 percent to 58.70 euros.      For the first time in a first half-year, CTS Eventim's consolidated sales climbed to more than one billion euros. Adjusted earnings (Ebitda) rose to 170.8 million euros. The company became more confident for the current full year, with earnings expected to grow moderately compared to the previous year.      Sales in the second quarter were unexpectedly strong, wrote analyst Thomas Maul of DZ Bank. He added that the live entertainment segment was the main contributor to this, although it was not very profitable. Looking ahead, the expert noted that presales for Taylor Swift's ""The Eras Tour"" got off to a very successful start in July. The tour, he said, has the potential to be a ""mega-seller.""      From an investor's point of view, the current Borsen year has been lukewarm so far. The share is virtually treading water. In May and June, there were strong price gains, with the share price rising by up to 20 percent by June 9. But then the share price began to fall sharply. The trigger was a program by TV satirist Jan Bohmermann, in which he took issue with the market position and fee policy of the event marketer and ticket retailer, among other things./bek/ngu/jha/",© dpa-AFX - 2023,CTS Eventim AG & Co.

A new phase of the cloud era is beginning for the software manufacturer, analyst Oliver Frey wrote in a study presented on Tuesday. He included the software group's stock in his rating with a ""buy"" rating and a price target of 148 (current price: 128.06) euros.      The decision to move into the subscription-based, online rental software (cloud) business and the associated investments are crucial for SAP's future competitiveness, Frey believes. The measures taken are increasingly having an impact and are reflected in the updated ambitions for 2025.      Momentum is clearly on the side of the cloud, he said. Only a small double-digit number of customers still choose to buy software, while hundreds of customers had moved to the cloud in the first quarter of 2023. Cloud activities should not only be the dominant source of revenue for SAP this year, but also the main driver of double-digit percentage growth in operating profit, the expert predicts.

The management upgraded both its 2023 revenue and pre-tax profit guidance on the back of the higher margins anticipated on its client assets. In our view the bank looks well positioned to contend with any challenges ahead. FACTOperating income: CHF265m (+32% yoy, 4% above our estimates and 2% above consensus). 
• Net fee and commission income: CHF81m (-19% yoy).
• Net interest income (NII): CHF103m vs CHF15m in H1-22. 
• Net trading income: CHF81m (-4% yoy). 
Opex: CHF138m (+30% yoy and 5% above our estimates). 
Net result from JV: CHF2.3m loss (vs CHF2.9m loss in H1-22). 
Pre-tax result: CHF125m (+38% yoy, 3% above our estimates and 9% below the consensus). Pre-tax profit margin at 47% vs 45% in H1-22. This was above the management’s 2023 target (46.5%). 
Client assets reached CHF56.9bn (vs CHF52.2bn in FY-22). The number of client accounts rose by 6.4% yoy to 555k accounts. 
Net new money: CHF3bn vs CHF2.7bn in H2-22 and CHF5bn in H1-22. 
The management upgraded both its revenue and pre-tax result targets for 2023 on the back of an upgraded outlook on NII, forecasting CHF530m of revenue (vs CHF495m) and a CHF250m pre-tax result (vs CHF230m) thus leading to a 47% pre-tax profit margin.
Management 2025 targets were kept unchanged: a CHF750m revenue, a CHF350m pretax result (47.5% pretax margin) and CHF7bn net new money per year. ANALYSISSwissquote realized a good H1-23, continuing to reap the benefits of higher rates on its liquidity and investment portfolio, more than offsetting the decline observed in transaction volumes linked to fading market volatility and an uncertain economic environment. The management upgraded both its 2023 revenue and pre-tax profit guidance on the back of the higher margins anticipated on its client assets thanks to the elevated interest rate levels foreseen. All the 2025 targets were maintained. The group continues to look fit for any coming environment, with non-transaction revenue coming notably from higher interest margins and a positive impact from market volatility on fee and trading income acting as mutual hedges. 
Revenue came in above the guidance with much of the growth coming from the very high NII. This was mainly due to the continued general increase in interest rates observed across all major currencies (CHF, USD, EUR) but also from the continued rise in client cash deposits (CHF9.4bn vs CHF9.2bn at the end of 2022) coming from the combination of new money and continued customer cautiousness. Another tailwind on NII came from the fact that the group invested a larger part of these deposits in loans and investment securities, anticipating the maturities of its portfolio, thus increasing the yield generated. Part of the rationale for this came from the fact that the management expected policy rates hikes to be close to their highs in developed economies, rendering duration more attractive than in 2022. The management expects higher interest rates to continue to draw NII higher in 2023, leading to a considerable increase in the margin on assets forecasted (94bp vs 87bp guided in 2022, with higher interest margin on deposits being solely responsible for the rise in margins). 
The management was confident in its interest margin outlook which should more than compensate for the low-volatility recorded in the market over H1-23 as well as the high uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, which led to continued cautiousness in client positioning. Should volatility return in H2-23 and 2024, transaction volume will likely benefit from this shift in the market environment which could play out in favour of Swissquote’s fee income generation and the group achieving its 2025 revenue target. Cryptos are another source of potential tailwinds which could emerge in the coming environment, with interest returning to this market, as the industry experiences short but abrupt cycles and as the current “crypto winter” is about to celebrate its two-year anniversary at the end of the year. On the other hand, a shadow overhanging the group’s NII tailwind which has so far not shown its presence is a possible increase in the pass-through rate, the proportion of policy rate hikes returned to depositors as remuneration on the cash held in their accounts, which could occur as competitive pressure emerges and a fight for deposits begins among banks and other financial institutions. 
Opex growth, although quite substantial, was due largely to the rise in staff headcount (+7% yoy), higher variable remuneration (CHF9.7m vs CHF3.1m for H1-22), higher marketing expenses (+21% yoy) and investments in growth. The management indicated that the group remained committed to investing in technology as it remains a critical element in improving services for customers and attracting new business and fresh money, thus sticking to future pre-tax margin improvement instead of the current pre-tax margin maximization.
All in all, the H1 was an illustration of how Swissquote’s business model remains one of economies-of-scale, leaving the online bank and broker well positioned to contend with the potentially uncertain coming market environment. IMPACTThe results were slightly above our estimates. Given the upgraded 2023 guidance, we may review upward our forecasts.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Swissquote Group Holding Ltd,SQN,CH0010675863,Equities,Financial & Commodity Market Operators

They rose by 3.7 percent to 6.90 euros after the figures for the second quarter. Before that, they had lost more than eleven percent from their recent high four weeks ago. The 200-day line currently at 6.60 euros had held as support on Tuesday.      Investors were therefore cautious in the quarterly report of the industrial group. This was well received by Moses Ola from JPMorgan. Both from the perspective of the individual divisions and in terms of cash flow, the figures were strong. The operating profit of the steel business in Europe exceeded market expectations by almost a fifth.      Free cash flow, meanwhile, was more than twice as high as expected. It had benefited from a working capital release of almost 300 million euros, the expert said./bek/zb----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,thyssenkrupp AG,TKA,DE0007500001,Equities,Iron & Steel

The slightly more optimistic forecast for operating profit in the current fiscal year is already reflected in market expectations, she added.

Although traders praised the fact that the burdens of the wind power subsidiary Gamesa were now finally quantified, the outlook of the energy technology group was sobering. The losses in Gamesa's wind business have counteracted everything positive, wrote analyst Akash Gupta of JPMorgan.      At the end of June, the Dax-listed shares had lost 37 percent of their market capitalization in just one day, making them one of the biggest daily losers in the German benchmark index.       The reason was the problems at Gamesa, which is why the group had to withdraw its forecasts. At 13.75 euros, the shares had marked the lowest price since November 2022.

Indeed, in view of ""massive uncertainty over dilution"", the analyst considers that he is currently unable to define a price target. Previously, the broker had positioned itself as 'buy', with a target of 18 euros.  In retrospect, we can better understand the deterioration in results and FCF in the 1st half of the year, as Atos wanted to put a stop to the situation before selling Tech Foundations to D. Kretinsky"", says the broker. While the sale price of Tech Foundations (EV of E2bn) is good news, 'the entity that will remain listed will be heavily indebted, which is why Atos has finally announced a capital increase of E900m, contrary to the commitment made by management in June 2022', stresses the research firm. Invest Securities also points out that, given that 80% of this capital increase will take place at a price that is not yet fixed, the risk of massive dilution is high, and will increase as the share price falls.As a reminder, the share price fell by some 16% yesterday.

The research firm reports that management remains confident but more cautious for the second half of the year.""The new EBITDA guidance (610/650 ME vs. 570/630 ME) reflects this caution"", says Oddo BHF, which estimates that, based on the upper end of the range, H2 EBITDA would be 296 ME, i.e. stable vs. H2 2022. The lower end of the range would translate into a decline of almost 12% vs. H2 2022.  Against this backdrop, we have adjusted our 2023 EBITDA estimate by +3% to 630 ME (+5% YoY, mid-range guidance, css 595 ME), i.e. a 9.5% margin (+60bp), of which 10.7% in H1 and 8.3% in H2', says the analyst.

Last night, Bonduelle reported Q4 sales in line with expectations, at 590.7 ME (586 MEe), up 5.2% including 1.2% forex.  Organic growth came to 4%, close to our expectations of 4.2%e, implying annual growth for 2022/23 of 5%, in line with our guidance"", emphasized the analyst. Overall for the year, sales rose by 9.2% to ME 2,406.2, and Bonduelle confirmed its guidance of an operating margin before non-recurring items of close to 2.5%, despite an inflationary context and a downturn in food consumption since the third quarter.

Organic sales growth in Q2 was only 2% (consensus 3.6%). In H1, volumes were down 2.7%, while prices were up 7.3%. EBITA margin rose by 170 bp to 22.2%, supported by the wide gap between price increases and inflation in raw materials and components (+0.3% in H1 for the latter).

Despite a decline in volume, the company managed to keep revenue stable thanks to higher average selling prices, while improving its margins thanks to its hedging policy and a presence in niche markets. EBITDA, excluding one-off effects, increased by 34% and the margin increased by 5.6pp.FACT
Revenue: €840.7m (vs €831.6m in H1 22)
EBITDA: €200.5m (vs €143.8m in H1 22)
Net profit: €90.3m (vs €66.6m in H1 22)
Outlook upgraded: EBITDA now around €365m (previously €335-345m)ANALYSISCementir Holding has reported a good set of H1 results, with a significant increase in revenue and EBITDA. Despite a decrease in the volumes of cement (-5.5%), RMC (-11.3%) and aggregates (-15.3%), the company managed to achieve a 1.1% increase in revenue and a 39.5% increase in EBITDA due to its successful management of price over costs. 
The higher EBITDA was seen in all markets, allowing the company to reach a margin of 23.9%, 6.6pp higher than in the previous year thanks to strong pricing as well as the company’s careful management of energy costs, supported by a strong hedging policy. It is worth noting that EBITDA includes €7.5m of capital gains; excluding this one-off, the margin stands at 22.9%, 5.6pp higher than in the previous year. 
While energy costs have reached their peak in the last year, they have now stabilised at a level that is still higher than the average of previous years. Consequently, we anticipate that prices will follow the same trend in the coming quarter and stabilise. However, it is important to note that inflation might cause labour and financial costs to continue to rise this year.
Performance by division
In the Nordic and Baltic regions, which contributed 40% of the group’s EBITDA, sales experienced a 5.7% decrease due to declining volumes in both domestic and export markets. However, there are signs of stabilisation in the volume decline. The negative trend in these regions can be attributed to high inflation and increased interest rates, which have impacted the residential sector and investments in public works. Despite these challenges, there is a notable development with the construction of an underwater tunnel connecting Denmark to Germany, which managed to offset partially the volume decline in Denmark. As a result, Denmark saw a 4.7% increase in revenue and a significant 53.7% rise in EBITDA. On the other hand, Norway and Sweden were more severely affected, experiencing a 22% drop in revenue and a substantial 64% decline in EBITDA year on year. Nevertheless, the margin still increased by 8.3pp.
The Belgium and France segment showed a strong performance, with a 12% increase in revenue and an 18% increase in EBITDA, despite a double-digit volume decline. This was mainly due to successful price increases that offset the volume decline, and the EBITDA margin also saw a significant increase of 120bp, thanks to the efficient management of energy costs.
In North America, the US market encountered a 14% decrease in volume in Texas and California, mainly caused by competitive pressure from imports. As a result, despite implementing price increases and benefiting from a positive FX impact of 1.1%, revenue experienced a decline of 1.1%. Additionally, EBITDA also suffered, dropping by 18% due to higher operating costs, leading to a significant decrease of 320bp in the EBITDA margin.
In the Asia Pacific region, China experienced a 1.5% rise in revenue, attributed to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in Q2. The substantial increase in volumes more than compensated for the decline observed in Q1. However, EBITDA, excluding one-time effects, decreased by 18% due to lower prices. On the other hand, in Malaysia, revenue remained stable despite a significant decrease in white cement exports, as it was offset by strong demand in the local market. Notably, EBITDA in Malaysia saw a remarkable increase of 43%, primarily driven by higher selling prices and reduced freight costs, partially balanced by increased production costs. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that both the Chinese Yuan (CNY) and Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) depreciated over the same period.
The company shifted focus from cement exports (down by 50%) to the more profitable domestic market. Antiseismic investment-driven projects increased demand, leading to a 38% revenue increase. EBITDA more than doubled to €34m as higher cement prices offset production costs. Excluding one-off effects, EBITDA reached €29m, with an 18% margin. Notably, the TRY devaluated by 32.7% compared to the Euro during the period.
In Egypt, revenue decreased by 5.1% primarily due to the negative impact of FX (74%). However, EBITDA increased by 44% due to the efficient management of production costs and an increase in selling prices, resulting in a 970bp increase in the margin.IMPACTThe company has raised its FY23 guidance and now anticipates EBITDA to be around €365m. Despite a robust quarter in a challenging environment, the management has adopted a cautious approach due to uncertainties related to the devaluation of the Turkish lira and the ongoing demand slowdown in the Nordics. Accounting for these factors, the estimates have been adjusted upwards, and the recommendation to buy the stock is reiterated.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Cementir Holding N.V.,CEM,NL0013995087,Equities,Construction Materials

While the working day effect partly explains this slowdown (as well as an exceptional item in Singapore), it is above all the sign of a return to normal after a period of very high demand post COVID. The cautious message on margins, without being alarmist, could also make us tense up until the H1 23 results in mid-September"", says Invest Securities.  As our estimates already incorporate a cautious scenario, we have no reason to change them (especially as Alten has announced 3 small acquisitions), but the consensus could reduce its expectations (-5% at NBI level),"" adds the research firm. In view of this less favorable short-term momentum, Invest Securities reiterates its neutral opinion, with an adjusted target price of E142 (versus E146). Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KERING-4683/news/Kering-Oddo-BHF-raises-its-price-target-44452033/,KERING :  Oddo BHF raises its price target,"July 28, 2023 at 06:52 am EDT","Kering has published sales of 10135 ME for the 1st half of 2023, up 2%, and group EBIT of 2739 ME, representing a margin of 27% (compared with 28.4% for the 2nd half of 2022).Following this announcement, Oddo BHF confirms its Neutral recommendation on the share and raises its target price to E526 (from E498). Oddo BHF was expecting sales of E10140 (organic growth in Q2 of +3%) and EBIT of E2724 (margin of 26.9%). The company's consensus was for sales of ME 10161 and ME 2716 (margin 26.7%) respectively.  The results are therefore very close to expectations, confirming that topline growth was still well below the sector average in Q2 (in our opinion +17%), and that profitability showed a visible but continuing decline"", says Oddo BHF.  Retail sales trends by geography show a marked slowdown in Europe to +4% in Q2 after +15% in Q1, an even steeper decline in the Americas to -23% after -18% in Q1, a very good performance in Japan to +26% (Q1: +30%) helped by tourism, and finally a re-acceleration in Asia Pacific to +22% after +10% in Q1,"" stresses the analyst firm.  Outside Japan, these factors suggest a more marked slowdown for the Group in the US and Europe, and a recovery in Asia Pacific that is less visible than for the rest of the industry (two-year growth in Chinese spending in Q2 below 10%)'.The analyst believes that Gucci's Q2 growth is unchanged from Q1, and remains very weak at +1% (he was expecting +4%), while the H1 margin shows a slightly more pronounced decline to 35.3% from 36.5% in H1 2022 (he was targeting 35.8%).  The integration of more unfavorable exchange rates and greater caution on the Gucci top line for H2 2023 (Q3 at +3% vs. +7% previously, Q4 at +7% vs. +10%, i.e. FY growth at +3% vs. +6% previously) has led us to revise our annual sales forecasts very slightly downwards by -1%. The impact is more visible on EBIT (-2% 2023, -4% 2024 and -3% 2025) as we take into account the possibility of higher investments in Gucci's relaunch, leading to a normative margin in the transition period close to 35%' adds Oddo BHF.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

The share price reaction on the previous day to the profit warning seems exaggerated, as the reason was the business development of Micro-Optics, analyst Jonah Emerson wrote in a study available on Friday. However, micro-optics is not part of the semiconductor equipment maker's core business, he added. Emerson, on the other hand, still considers Suess' short- and medium-term growth prospects and margin potential attractive, not least because of its involvement in artificial intelligence.

The shares plunged 8.6 percent to 21.74 euros on Tradegate. In the pre-borsday low, the price loss even amounted to almost 12 percent.      The active ingredient researcher expects sales of only 750 to 790 million euros as a result of a hacker attack. Previously, 820 to 840 million euros had been on the cards for the current year. In terms of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda), adjusted for special effects, management expects 60 to 80 million euros. Previously, Evotec had planned to increase this result to 115 to 130 million euros in the current year.      ""That the annual targets would be cut was an open secret because of the cyberattack,"" a trader said. However, he said the extent of the cut in annual targets was ""larger than feared.""      Analyst Charles Weston of bank RBC noted that the market's expectation for Ebitda in the current year is now likely to be slashed by 42 percent, assuming the midpoint of Evotec's prospective range. In terms of sales, the corresponding reduction of the consensus estimate amounts to 8.5 percent.      The drop in the share price had recently become significantly higher: From the most recent low at the beginning of May, the share price had risen by around 55 percent and on Tuesday reached its highest level since August last year. Investors were therefore now also able to ""cash in"" and realize profits./bek/zb",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Evotec SE,EVT,DE0005664809,Equities,Biotechnology & Medical Research

The analyst has also reduced his target price from €36 to €34.  While we are leaving our sales estimates unchanged, our earnings expectations have been significantly reduced for 2023-25, to take account of management's focus on growth and the migration of the model to subscription-based services"", says Invest. The research firm points out that, while this does not call into question its positive medium/long-term opinion, the transition period could generate a certain amount of stress, especially as Visiativ remains a company with a high level of debt (95mE in liabilities for a capi of 150mE).Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

With a gain of almost five percent to around 375 euros, they overcame the resistance at 360 euros. The shares had repeatedly failed at this level in mid-June and in recent days.

From a fundamental perspective, sentiment had also improved, with the prospect of orders for the pharmaceutical and laboratory supplier rising again.

The 1st half of the year showed a good operating performance in line with the excellent health of the market for the best Parisian offices, the core of SFL's portfolio. In fact, organic rental growth rose sharply by +10.1% against a backdrop of near-perfect occupancy rates (99.6%)"", notes the analyst.Invest nevertheless points out that this performance was largely offset by the sharp rise in financial expenses (RNR/share, +1.8% to 1.16E). Over six months, NTA NAV is down -8.1%, due to a -4.1% drop in asset values, crystallizing a still too low yield of 3.4% (+35bp). As a result, further falls in asset values are highly likely (-16% by the end of 2024, according to Invest Securities estimates).  Nevertheless, its large pipeline of projects (900mE by 2026) and good debt profile should enable RNR to post a good medium-term growth profile (including +6.1% in 2023 and +10.6% in 2024)', stresses the broker.

""Investors have priced a great deal of optimism into the valuation of companies in recent trading weeks,"" wrote Borsen expert Andreas Lipkow in a market commentary. This high expectation could now hardly be met. ""Whether it's the quarterly figures from Porsche or LVMH, investors are showing rather disappointed faces everywhere,"" Lipkow said.

Nevertheless, Oddo BHF believes that LVMH is in a position to maintain average annual EBIT growth of more than 10% over 2023-2025 'The absence of any major positive surprise on the topline and the slight squeeze on the group EBIT margin over the half-year due to the effect of marketing expenditure can be considered rather disappointing', says Oddo BHF. Nevertheless, 'beyond the China effect from one quarter to the next, the luxury goods sector as a whole is now beginning to normalize its growth rate, and it is logical that the potential for positive surprises should diminish in this context', acknowledges the analyst's office.

It's a pity, as we consider the stock market reaction to Medidata's temporary slowdown to be disproportionate, given that (i) growth in this business is set to return to >+10% from Q4 23, and (ii) management has a track record that argues in its favor, as evidenced by its talk of China in Q1 23, which has been verified in Q2 23' says the analyst firm.

The 1st half of the year showed a good operating performance in line with the excellent health of the market for the best Parisian offices, the core of SFL's portfolio. In fact, organic rental growth rose sharply by +10.1% against a backdrop of near-perfect occupancy rates (99.6%)"", notes the analyst.Invest nevertheless points out that this performance was largely offset by the sharp rise in financial expenses (RNR/share, +1.8% to 1.16E). Over six months, NTA NAV is down -8.1%, due to a -4.1% drop in asset values, crystallizing a still too low yield of 3.4% (+35bp). As a result, further falls in asset values are highly likely (-16% by the end of 2024, according to Invest Securities estimates).  Nevertheless, its large pipeline of projects (900mE by 2026) and good debt profile should enable RNR to post a good medium-term growth profile (including +6.1% in 2023 and +10.6% in 2024)', stresses the broker.

In addition, the stock of Adidas competitor Nike was also downgraded.      After he had given clear preference to Zara parent Inditex twelve months ago, Adidas shares are now his favorite, analyst Warwick Okines wrote in a study available on Tuesday. Accordingly, he upgraded the stock of German sporting goods maker Adidas to ""outperform"" from ""neutral"" and raised his price target to 210 euros from 170 euros. At the same time, he lowered his investment rating for Inditex from ""outperform"" to ""neutral"" and maintained his price target of 36 euros.      The upside potential for Adidas would thus currently still be around 14 percent, after the share is currently up almost 6 percent following key figures, raised annual targets and the Exane study. For Inditex, the maintained price target would still mean an upside potential of just under 6 percent.      A year ago, he compared Adidas and Inditex, and the earnings performance of the two could not have been more different since then. While Adidas' profits were dwindling, Inditex had consistently beaten forecasts and increased profits. Now, however, the tide is turning, he wrote.      After re-evaluating social media data, app usage and internet searches, he concluded: The Adidas brand is picking up steam again. As the brand gains momentum, Okines believes the company can quickly recover profitability. ""Gross margins should strengthen earnings power in the process,"" he expects. His earnings estimate for 2024, for example, is now about 30 percent higher than the average expectation in the market.      Looking at Inditex, which includes the brands Zara, Massimo Dutti and Bershka, Okines now sees little scope for increasing forecasts. Ebit margins are back at a ten-year high, he said, and the company's borse value is near record levels.      At Adidas competitor Nike, demand is cooling off, the Exane analyst also quotes his colleagues in the US. These downgraded the shares of the U.S. sporting goods manufacturer this Tuesday from ""Neutral"" to ""Underweight"" and cut the price target by 7 U.S. dollars to 92 dollars.      With an ""outperform"" rating, analysts at Exane BNP Paribas expect the stock to outperform the sector over the next twelve months. According to them, the share should develop in line with the sector with a rating of ""Neutral"", while ""Underperform"" means that the stock should develop worse than the sector. A period of twelve months always applies./ck/bek/jha/  Publication of the original studies: 07/25/2023",© dpa-AFX - 2023,adidas AG,ADS,DE000A1EWWW0,Equities,Footwear

The signals we are sending out are encouraging, but further improvement in occupancy in H2 is not guaranteed"", stresses the analyst, who points out that the sharp rise in financial expenses has led to stable net income (E2.36/share). Refinancing conditions in the first half of the year testify to the Group's sound balance sheet (the 2023 RNR guidance has been slightly raised by +2.4% (420mE) and the dividend (3.75E) still looks sustainable for the next three years, summarizes Invest Securities. Nevertheless, 'the company could be forced to cut its dividend in 2026 or 2027 (3.33E according to our estimates).

This is likely to lower market expectations for adjusted operating profit (Ebitda) by five to seven percent, analyst Richard Vosser wrote in a research note presented on Monday. Market estimates for core earnings per share are likely to be revised downward by eight to ten percent. A weak set of second-quarter numbers and a forecast cut were expected, but the magnitude of the cut is likely to surprise the market, Vosser said. He expects Bayer shares to fall significantly on Tuesday./ajx/he      Publication of the original study: 24.07.2023 / 21:08 / BST First disclosure of the original study: 24.07.2023 / 21:08 / BST",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Bayer AG,BAYN,DE000BAY0017,Equities,Pharmaceuticals

Margins should then recover and more cash should be generated, analyst Pal Skirta wrote in a study presented on Monday. The latter would then also return to pre-crisis levels. The expert therefore upgraded the shares of the automotive supplier and tire manufacturer from ""Sell"" to ""Hold"" and raised the price target from 50.00 to 73.60 euros. The shares are currently trading at just over 74 euros.      The Capital Markets Day next winter could become a driving force for the share price, Skirta continued. This is because at this event the company will probably explain its strategy in more detail, on the one hand, and raise its medium-term targets, on the other. The medium-term future is likely to depend to a large extent on the extent to which the corporation is able to earn money with its research and development pipeline in the automotive division.      According to the analyst, Continental is at a crossroads, as its future market shares are threatened by the global upheavals in the automotive industry. This, he said, is forcing the corporation to innovate even in the long-established tire segment.      However, Skirta is cautious about 2023. The implementation of the rebuild is likely to weigh on the investment background for the time being. However, the expert does not expect a profit warning. Rather, he says, Continental is on track to meet its full-year forecasts.

Growth in the quarter was driven by light vehicles, with an increase of +4.9% in Q2 (after 1.9% in Q1). On the other hand, growth is more timid in heavy goods vehicles, with an increase of just +0.5% after +1.5% in Q1 2023' says the research firm.Oddo BHF expects sales for the Eiffage Group to rise by 10% to 10,409 ME, with EBIT up 10% to 1,050 ME and net income up 15% in H1 2023 compared with H1 2022. ' The Group should confirm its annual guidance of ' a further increase in its operating income in Works and Concessions ' and an increase in net income, thanks in particular to the integration of Getlink by the equity method from Q2 2023.

Following last night's results, the analyst believes that 'the French aircraft manufacturer's results for the first half of 2023 may appear disappointing'. He points out that the company took few orders, delivered very few aircraft, recorded a 26% drop in sales and consumed almost €2 billion in cash.""In reality, these figures reflect the ramp-up in production and are, in our view, the prelude to sales taking off. Order intake should rebound strongly in the second half of the year, taking the order backlog to 8 years' sales"", says Stifel.Against this backdrop, the broker expects EPS to rise. We estimate that by the end of the year, the order book should total more than 230 Rafales and almost 90 Falcon jets"", concludes the research firm.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Last night, Dassault Aviation published half-year earnings 9% below Oddo BHF's expectations in terms of operating income, and 2% below the VA consensus, mainly due to a shift in deliveries to the 2nd half of 2023.  This slight disappointment on H1 2023 EBIT is largely offset by the confirmation of the guidance of 35 Falcon and 15 Rafale deliveries over 2023 as a whole, with a strong concentration on H2, as well as by financial income well above our expectations"", adds the analyst.

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BASF-SE-6443227/news/Wacker-Chemie-investors-also-put-profit-warning-well-away-44366700/,Wacker Chemie investors also put profit warning well away,"July 19, 2023 at 12:23 pm EDT","FRANKFURT (dpa-AFX) - The next piece of bad news from the chemical industry was again absorbed quite well by investors on Wednesday. With Wacker Chemie, another group had to trim its targets for the full year, which pushed the shares four percent into the red at the start of trading on the stock exchange on Wednesday. However, the share price managed to turn around at the 200-day line and at times even edged upwards. Most recently, they were again moderately in the red with 0.3 percent.      Recently, other sector stocks had also hardly reacted after bad news. Profit warnings from chemical companies have recently become the rule because of sour demand, which is associated with the reduction of inventories. Borsianer therefore already wondered in the morning whether the news from Wacker will again sustainably weigh. Sebastian Satz of Barclays Bank expressed his suspicion, in view of the early price losses, that there had certainly been hope in the market that Wacker would avoid a warning.      Many analysts stressed that the extent of the target reduction was a negative surprise compared to consensus. Markus Mayer of Baader Bank, however, qualified the significance of this somewhat. He had recently held many discussions with investors - with the conclusion that expectations for Ebitda this year had already been lowered below the one billion euro mark. The ""shadow consensus"" had thus probably been below that of analysts and this should contain the share price reaction as observed on Wednesday.      ""Since we assume that the profit trend will bottom out in 2023 and that Wacker will also benefit from solar claims and subsidized electricity prices, we recommend investors to take advantage of a perhaps significant price weakness to buy,"" the Baader expert had recommended before the stock market launch.      Mayer and his JPMorgan colleague Chetan Udeshi calculated that the mean value of the new target range, which has now been put at 0.8 and 1.0 billion euros, is 19 percent below consensus estimates. The previously advised range had been up to 1.4 billion euros. Udeshi expects the consensus to fall by 15 percent. Cuts are also likely again in 2024, he said.      Barclays expert Satz called it a ""significant target reduction,"" driven primarily by weak demand for silicone products. ""The company benefited from extreme tightness and strong demand in early 2022 and now faces the opposite,"" the expert argued. Meanwhile, the polysilicon business, which is important for the semiconductor and solar industries, is doing better than feared, he said.      The fact that Wacker Chemie fared better than the sector was recently already priced into the share price: The shares have already gained more than a fifth since the June low, which is significantly more than the pan-European index for the chemical industry, which has gained a maximum of five percent in a similar period. However, the sector index remained on its stabilization course on Wednesday, moving 0.4 percent higher and again attempting to jump above its 100-day average.BASF, for example, gained a good one percent on Wednesday to a high for more than a month. Evonik, however, saw a one percent drop after its shares were downgraded to ""underweight"" by Morgan Stanley. Compared with the sector, they had also recovered more than average by up to 13 percent since the low in mid-June.Covestro also showed weakness with a discount of 1.8 percent. However, takeover fantasies have been playing a bigger role here recently: according to circles, the oil group Abu Dhabi National Oil (Adnoc) wants to increase its bid for the Dax group from the previously rumored 55 to 57 euros per share. The share price came back on Wednesday after briefly jumping the previous evening.

The diagnostics specialist reported a weak first half and revised its full-year targets significantly downward, analyst Odysseas Manesiotis wrote in a research note published on Wednesday. Earnings per share expectations for 2023 are now expected to fall by around 20 percent. According to Manesiotis, the news from Stratec suggests negative conclusions for Biomerieux in particular, and to a lesser extent for Qiagen, Diasorin and Tecan. Stratec is known for comparatively optimistic targets, he said.

Following this announcement, Oddo BHF confirms its neutral recommendation on the stock, with a target price of E498.The group's central management will be strengthened with the promotion to deputy CEO of Jean Marc Duplaix (current CFO), who will be in charge of finance and operations, and Francesca Belletini (CEO Saint Laurent), who will be in charge of brand development, says Oddo BHF.' The management of the Gucci Group's main brand (which alone accounts for almost 70% of its EBIT) is set to change with the departure of Marco Bizzarri, effective September 23. He will be replaced, for a transitional period, by Jean François Palus', stresses the analyst firm. The analyst believes that the change at the head of Gucci seems to suggest that, since the conviction has recently been acquired that Gucci could not recover as desired in its current structure, Jean François Palus will be expected to improve the brand's operations and prepare for the future. ' We may have to wait for a new appointment to see just how much things will change,' reckons Oddo BHF.  The stock is highly discounted, but Gucci's financial trajectory remains particularly uncertain at this stage: we are not convinced that the current efforts undertaken are sufficient to ensure a recovery, but the amplitude and nature of the changes to come remain difficult to anticipate at this stage.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Attestor, which was initially allied with 3F, has now joined forces with Kretinsky/Fimalac (and may be sued at a later date)', adds the analyst. Oddo BHF believes that the offer is slightly more favorable to existing shareholders, who are diluted to 0.3% of the capital compared with 0.2% in the previous offer.In addition, the debt reduction is lower, at E4.7 bn compared with E5.0 bn in the first offer, so that the company will be c. 300 ME more leveraged.While the new offer is slightly more attractive for shareholders than the first, the dilution will be massive, and the 108 million current shares will be replaced by several tens of billions of new shares after debt restructuring"", concludes the analyst.

However, it said the fashion group is very dependent on the European consumer, who is struggling with a more difficult environment and high cost of living, which is not making it any easier for Boss./gl/la      Publication of the original study: 17.07.2023 / 19:44 / BST First disclosure of the original study: 18.07.2023 / 00:15 / BST----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Hugo Boss AG,BOSS,DE000A1PHFF7,Equities,Apparel & Accessories

Therefore, analyst Chetan Udeshi downgraded the chemicals trader's stock from ""Neutral"" to ""Underweight"" and lowered the price target from 83 to 66 euros in an industry report available on Friday. This is almost five percent below the current level.      The continuing weakness in demand in the chemical sector, reflected in numerous profit warnings, together with the increasingly weaker price trends, raises the risk of an unexpectedly massive earnings normalization, also among distributors, the expert fears. He says his estimates for adjusted operating earnings (Ebitda) for Brenntag and rivals IMCD and Azelis in 2023 and 2024 are below consensus forecasts.      At Brenntag, Udeshi sees particularly high earnings risks due to its strong exposure to the basic chemicals market, where pricing pressure is stronger. He also complained the company is not seeing volume growth compared to 2019. The earnings performance in recent quarters also indicates that the quality of Brenntag's specialty chemicals business is significantly lower than that of IMCD and Azelis, the expert added. This reduces the potential for a spin-off of this business in the near future, he added.      Among the other two sector stocks, the expert prefers Azelis to IMCD due to its cheaper valuation. He therefore rates the two stocks as ""Overweight"" and ""Neutral"", respectively. The medium- to long-term growth prospects in the sector remain attractive and offer considerable scope for value-enhancing acquisitions.      According to the ""Underweight"" rating, JPMorgan expects the stock to underperform the respective sector in the coming six to twelve months. ""Overweight,"" on the other hand, means the stock should outperform during that time. ""Neutral,"" in the bank's view, suggests a trend in line with the respective sector./gl/tih/jha/      Analyzing institute JPMorgan.

Last night, Kaufman & Broad reported sales of €848.8 million for the first half, up 47.8% from €574.5 million a year earlier. This increase is in line with analysts' expectations (Oddo BHF was forecasting sales of ME 846), and can be explained by a stronger contribution from the Commercial division, with sales of ME 380.9 (ME 87.3 in H1 2022) due to the impact of the Austerlitz project, says Oddo BHF. On the other hand, the analyst points out that MOP came in slightly below expectations, at 8% versus 8.2% expected. Furthermore, Kaufman & Broad's management has adjusted its targets downwards, expecting sales to increase by 6% to 10% (i.e. around -5% compared with the previous estimate). Return on sales should remain unchanged at around 8%.Oddo BHF is therefore lowering its 2023 sales and ROE estimates by around -5%.'All in all, following this publication, our 2023e EPS have been lowered by 11%', says the broker, who nevertheless points out that 'the Austerlitz project is a major support factor.

This remains under pressure in the coming year, warned UBS analyst Adam Berlin in a study presented on Monday. The real estate platform Scout 24 he predicts in it also because of increasing competition a weaker growth. The expert therefore issued a sell recommendation and downgraded the shares from ""Neutral"" to ""Sell"".      After the price increase this year by a fifth, the papers of the sales platform are more expensive than those of the competition - despite lower growth, the industry expert also criticized. He lowered the price target from 59 to 51.40 euros (currently: 53.56).      The German housing market is suffering from rising interest rates. Many people can no longer afford the high prices for property purchases or rents. UBS expert Berlin estimates that despite the difficult environment, many brokers will not react quickly enough and call lower prices to boost their business. The tense situation could also lead to a number of insolvencies among real estate agencies, Berlin fears.      Already in the second quarter, this development is likely to have an impact on Scout24 : The expert expects a smaller increase in revenues compared to the start of the year, partly because growth from business with brokers declined.      For the full year, Berlin expects growth of only ten percent compared to the Group's forecast of 12 percent, if the acquisition of real estate data provider Sprengnetter is excluded. The pace is also expected to slow further in 2024. Looking ahead to the coming year, Berlin also considers it less likely that Scout24 will again be able to push through price increases of ten percent as in previous years.      The expert therefore lowered his expectations for earnings per share in the coming year, which is five percent below current market forecasts. However, Berlin is certain that these should also fall significantly.      Meanwhile, he also sees serious competition in the classifieds portal of the Norwegian operator Adevinta, which recently also took over the corresponding business from Ebay. In the meantime, the portal is on a par with Scout24 in terms of rentals and comes second in terms of sales, Berlin noted.      With its ""Sell"" rating, UBS assumes that the total return of the share (price gain plus dividend) over a period of twelve months is at least six percent below the market return expected by UBS./tav/tih/jha/      Publication of the original study: 07.07.2023 / 19:07 / GMT First circulation of the original study: 07.07.2023 / 19:07 / GMT",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Scout24 SE,G24,DE000A12DM80,Equities,Internet Services

Oddo BHF reports that the Group is cautious for the future, but that its positioning is a guarantee of relative security. Against this backdrop, the broker is raising its annual EBIT estimates by 1% and EPS by 2%, while remaining relatively conservative on margins. According to Oddo BHF, the stock's resilient profile should be 'a clear advantage at a time when growth in the sector is set to slow'. Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Therefore, analyst Adam Fox-Rumley downgraded the papers of the telecom group from ""Buy"" to ""Hold"". He also reduced his free cash flow and earnings (Ebitda) forecasts for the years 2023 to 2025 and cut his price target from EUR 25 to EUR 15 (current price: EUR 12.50).      The share price drivers expected for the first half of the year, such as a recovery in Ionos shares or 1&1's 5G capital markets day, have so far failed to materialize, Fox-Rumley wrote in a report available Friday. While he still sees some value in the company, he believes the road to realizing this upside potential is rocky.      The expert explained that United Internet's revaluation now depends on the market's view of its subsidiary 1&1. The mobile provider's management currently seems confident that everything is going according to plan with the 5G network rollout. In contrast, the market still seems to be in a skeptical ""show-me"" mode, with the real test of the rollout pace coming in the fourth quarter and early 2024.      HSBC always rates such stocks as ""hold"" with a price target up to 5 percent above or below the current price./edh/tih/men     Analyzing institute HSBC.

With Thales due to publish its Q1 results on July 21, Oddo BHF expects organic sales growth of 6.5% to ME 8633 (of which 9.2% in Q1 and 4.3% in Q2). The broker believes that profitability should be preserved, and models EBIT at 989 ME, i.e. a margin of 11.5% (+66 bp). For its part, Thales anticipates organic sales growth of between 4% and 7% and an EBIT margin of between 11.5% and 11.8%.'All in all, we think Thales may just tighten its targets for fiscal 2023 towards the top end of existing ranges', concludes Oddo BHF.

The Group is cautious for the future, but its positioning is a guarantee of relative security.  There will be no slowdown in the United States where, after Q1 at +19%, we can expect Q2 growth to remain well above 10%, and both Europe (Q1 at c.+24%) and Japan (Q1 +26%) should, in our opinion, continue to grow above +20% in Q2', says Oddo BHF.' In the Asia-Pacific region, the acceleration in growth in Q2 compared with Q1 (+22.5%) due to China is likely to be slightly less marked than for the rest of the sector, as Hermès held up much better than its peers in China in Q2 last year (with a strong acceleration in June)' adds the research house.The absence of any noticeable slowdown in Europe/Japan/Americas has led the analyst to raise its Q2 growth forecast (y/y cc) from 19.3% to 23.8% (the most recent Visible Alpha consensus is c.+23%, says Oddo BHF).  We remain relatively cautious on H2 growth (Q3 forecast raised from +7.7% to 9.1%, but still showing a noticeable slowdown, Q4 forecast virtually unchanged at +12.1%), hence an increase in our annual growth assumption from +15.2% to +16.6%. For 2024, Oddo BHF is still forecasting growth of around +12%, reflecting a price premium over the rest of the sector that the analyst evaluates at c. +300 bp.

The broker believes that, after a difficult 2023, a strong rebound in net income is expected in 2024 (+34%) and 2025, boosting the share's recovery.

The analyst reports that management has confirmed the targets set at the IPO a year ago, i.e. installed capacity of 55 MW by 2024 (+10 MW in 2023, then +40 MW in 2024), then 200 MW in 2026, with full impact in 2027.Meanwhile, Oddo believes that FCF will remain negative, with EBITDA expected to be negative until 2026. Management is aiming to reach the EBITDA break-even point in 2026, but the ramp-up will necessarily be long"", notes the analyst.In concrete terms, ""we have revised downwards our earnings sequence, with sales of around 2 ME (vs. 7.6 ME previously) and EBITDA of -26.4 ME (vs. -21.2 ME previously) for 2023"", concludes the broker.

Morgan initiated coverage of Getlink shares with a Buy recommendation and a two-year price target of 19 euros.In a research note, the analyst praises the diversification of the group, which holds the concession for the Channel Tunnel until 2086, into rail freight (Europorte) and energy infrastructure (ElecLink).The intermediary points out that Getlink shares have largely underperformed the market this year, and are now trading on an Enterprise Value/Ebitda 2024 ratio of 13.5x, compared with its long-term average of 18.5x.J.P. Morgan points out that, at these levels, the share price sufficiently takes into account the uncertainties surrounding the business in the short term, but underestimates the price control from which the Group benefits.Nevertheless, J.P. Morgan considers the stock to be an attractive long-term investment, particularly in view of its exposure to the green growth theme.In an ideal bull case scenario, the stock could reach 22 euros in June 2025, he concludes, corresponding to a potential appreciation of 40%.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Wacker Chemie should also benefit from this, according to an industry report published on Tuesday. Analyst Sean McLoughlin therefore upgraded the share from ""Hold"" to ""Buy"" and raised the price target from 150 to 155 euros - which is now almost 22 percent above the current valuation level.      The expert pointed out that the skyrocketing of solar energy is continuing. The International Energy Agency expects higher investment in solar energy than in oil production for the first time in 2023. For this reason, McLoughlin now expects new solar energy plants with a capacity of 344 gigawatts to be built worldwide in the current year - 44 percent more than in 2022 and 18 percent more than he had previously expected. By 2026, this figure should already rise to 500 gigawatts. As recently as 2010, global demand was only 20 gigawatts, he recalled.      A new wave of supply for polysilicon from China has removed a major supply bottleneck and caused solar module prices to drop significantly since the beginning of the year, fueling demand, McLoughlin pointed out. Discussions at this year's Intersolar industry trade show showed that the industry expects polysilicon prices to stabilize at a low level and solar module prices to continue to fall, he said.      According to the expert, there is no end in sight to the overcapacity, as the five leading solar module manufacturers alone are planning to invest USD 7.5 billion in additional production capacity in the current year. In addition, he said, there are efforts to increase domestic production in the U.S. and Europe due to concerns about energy security, which should put even more pressure on polysilicon prices and make them increasingly independent of China.      McLoughlin also justified the Wacker Chemical upgrade by citing plans in Germany to support solar industry production. Meanwhile, his favorite sector companies in Asia are China's JinkoSolar, Longi, Flat Glass and Sungrow, all of whose shares he also rates ""buy.""/gl/tih/men  Publication of the original study: 03.07.2023 / 15:32 / GMT  First disclosure of the original study: 03.07.2023 / 21:02 / GMT      HSBC rates such stocks as ""Buy"" with a target price more than 20 percent above the current price.

In addition, ""Sodexo was positive on the outlook for Q4 and the start of 2024"", reports the analyst. Nevertheless, the maintenance of the 2023 guidance may seem disappointing and slightly conservative given the increase in expectations at Pluxee (ex-BRS), with Sodexo anticipating growth in excess of 20% vs. 20% previously, the analyst believes.

CFO. Following this meeting, Oddo BHF confirms its Outperform recommendation on the share, with a target price of E70.' Benoit Bazin doesn't want to 'build an empire', but rather focus on sustainable construction (growth, cash and ROCE) while respecting high CSR criteria' says Oddo BHF. The analyst also points out that share buybacks will continue, especially at this EBITDA multiple level, in excess of 500 ME per year.  The advantage of the North American market lies in its greater consolidation (listed companies) than the European market, which is still largely owned by families whose criteria are less focused on ROCE,"" stresses the analyst. Oddo BHF continues to believe that Saint-Gobain still has the potential to surprise, particularly in the first half of the year. The consensus is for a 10% fall in annual EBIT, compared with a 5/10% rise for Sika and even >10% for Holcim. The research firm now expects a decline of 6%, i.e. 4% above market expectations.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.
