However, a liberating blow in the chart failed to materialize. The papers of the Herzogenauracher climbed with plus 2.5 percent to 141.84 euros back to its 50-day line. In the weaker market environment, however, it put the brakes on a further rise. Puma, on the other hand, lost up to 3 percent after a downgrade.      Analyst Olivia Townsend of JPMorgan is optimistic, particularly ahead of Adidas' detailed annual results on March 8, and therefore also gave the shares ""Positive Catalyst Watch"" status. Her price target of 162 euros is just above the year-to-date high. Townsend is betting on surprise potential in 2024 in particular, after market expectations have come back massively following three profit warnings. Alluding to the new Adidas CEO Björn Gulden, she speaks of a ""Gulden Opportunity"".      Berenberg's Graham Renwick is also betting that Gulden will come clean with the outlook, especially given his reputation for ""promising little and then delivering more."" This would create a ""clean base"" for 2024, Renwick said. He even trusts the shares to reach 180 euros, a return to the interim highs from the summer of 2022.      For Puma, on the other hand, Townsend now only rates it ""neutral"". Puma remains a good long-term growth and margin story, and will also do well in 2023. However, Adidas simply has more potential at the moment.      Adidas is also ahead on an annual basis with a plus of 10 percent compared to Puma with a plus of 6 percent. The previous year did not go well for either, with the share price halving./ag/mis",© dpa-AFX - 2023,adidas AG,ADS,DE000A1EWWW0,Equities,Footwear

The latest, third profit warning has recalibrated market expectations to such an extent that there is now even potential for 2024 forecasts, the expert says.

Sopra Steria is thus targeting organic growth of 3 to 5% in 2023 (Oddo is at 3.1%, consensus at 2.9% pre-publication) as well as a MOA slightly above 9%. Believing that this is 'a very good publication from Sopra Steria', the analyst points out that the only bad news comes from the difficulties encountered at SFT.

We fear a slight loss of real estate value or a slight increase in the cost of financing, rather than blockages or serious difficulties in refinancing (unlike Orpéa)"", says Oddo.According to the analyst, ""the configuration at the start of the year still appears to be full of opposing elements.

Oddo considers this market sanction to be 'a little harsh in view of trends that remain solid in Q4 and a 2023 guidance that is admittedly disappointing in terms of margin, but with an overall unchanged medium-term trajectory'.Nevertheless, the broker believes that the 2023 guidance takes away from the Group's 2024 objective of 'aiming for a margin of 30%'.

The stock was down 4% yesterday, mainly due to a disappointing 2023 EBITDA margin guidance (26.4% vs. css at 27.0%), with a weaker-than-expected 2022 pro forma basis (25.4% vs. 26.0% reported)', reports the analyst. Oddo considers this market sanction to be 'a little harsh in view of trends that remain solid in Q4 and a 2023 guidance that is admittedly disappointing in terms of margin, but with an overall unchanged medium-term trajectory'.Nevertheless, the broker believes that the 2023 guidance takes away from the Group's 2024 objective of 'aiming for a margin of 30%'.

However, we consider the EBITA margin guidance to be disappointing, with a target change of -20/+10 bp, i.e. 17.4%/17.7% (consensus 17.8%)', notes the analyst. Against this backdrop, Oddo is raising its EPS guidance by 2% on average over 2023 and 2024, and anticipates organic sales growth of 9.1% in 2023 (vs. 3.5% previously).

The sugar producer has raised its earnings forecast for the fourth time in the past ten months, analyst Axel Herlinghaus wrote in a research note presented on Thursday. The latest higher assumption for operating profit (Ebit) is likely to come from energy costs. However, these remained a relevant component of uncertainty against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Nevertheless, in purely quantitative terms, gas supplies had eased considerably in view of the adequate German storage levels. In his view, the ""sugar lights"" for the coming twelve months are ""clearly green"". Operationally, the recent rise in ethanol prices to more than 800 euros per cubic meter has also improved the business prospects for the CropEnergies and Agrana starch holdings. However, it is important to keep an eye on further developments in the political environment, especially the Mercosur agreement./bek/la  Publication of the original study: 16.02.2023 / 13:12 / CET First disclosure of the original study: 16.02.2023 / 13:27 / CET----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Südzucker AG,SZU,DE0007297004,Equities,Food Processing

FDJ published good results for 2022, broadly in line with expectations. Nevertheless, the share price has been hit quite hard on the stock market (-5.4% at close), probably due to the disappointment over the dividend (1.37 E per share, 4% below expectations)', estimates Oddo. This stock market reaction is judged 'severe' by the analyst, particularly in view of the Group's results and its outlook for 2023. Oddo also points out that the European Commission's investigation into the amount of the balancing payment made by FDJ to the French state at the time of privatization should continue to weigh on the equity story. Management hopes for a decision in 2023, but the procedure could be lengthy, especially with possible appeals.  For 2023, FDJ expects sales growth of 4/5%, based on a pro forma landing in 2022 at 2,514 ME, which includes the acquisitions of Aleda and Addition, implying a sales range of 2,615 / 2,640 ME for 2023 according to our estimates', reports the analyst firm.

Carrefour is in an improved competitive position, with a clear strategy supported by a healthy financial situation, but operating conditions remain adverse, particularly in France, where state interventionism is counter-productive, while mass consumption is seeing its evolution arbitrated by inflation"", stresses the analyst.  Invest nevertheless considers the 2022 financial year to be ""correct"", but believes that the optimistic forecasts posted at the start of the year have been partly thwarted by new factors of weakness in Europe (Spain). In 2023, Brazil should be able to deliver on the promise of more profitable growth after giving primacy to leadership in PDM.  The sector limits Carrefour's stock market appeal, and its valuation is still modest, but insufficient to be more than a reminder,"" concludes the broker. Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Down 2.1 percent to 222.50 euros in the early afternoon, they were far and away at the bottom of the Dax.      By the beginning of February, the engine manufacturer's shares had more than halved in price in the space of three months, boosted by an optimistic forecast in the fall. Profit-taking then caused the share price to crumble somewhat in February. On Tuesday, the shares fell back to their lowest price in a good month. Even the highest dividend in the group's history, which beckons to shareholders for 2022, could not change that.      MTU's key figures for the fourth quarter and the full year 2022 presented a mixed picture, wrote analyst Holger Schmidt of DZ Bank in a study. For the expert, however, the better-than-expected profit and free cash flow development is more important than the revenue momentum, which, although strong, was nevertheless somewhat lower than expected. The lowering of the sales outlook is probably mainly due to the adjustment of the euro/dollar exchange rate./ajx/stk----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,MTU Aero Engines AG,MTX,DE000A0D9PT0,Equities,Aerospace & Defense

In addition, the financial institution removed the securities of the sporting goods manufacturer from the ""DZ Bank Equity Ideas"" recommendation list. ""The fact that a new CEO clears the air and starts in office with conservative targets is basically no surprise,"" analyst Thomas Maul wrote in a study available on Monday. However, he said the market was negatively surprised by the announced operating loss (Ebit) of up to 700 million euros. The disappointing forecast is explained on the one hand by the very likely scenario in which Adidas no longer sells any products by the rapper Kanye West (Yeezy brand), who is controversial because of anti-Semitic statements, and on the other hand by the fact that the consensus estimates have so far probably not taken sufficient account of the fact that Adidas has not been able to sell any products at all.The second reason is the one-off restructuring expenses, which have probably not been sufficiently taken into account in the consensus estimates to date, as well as burdens from the reduction of excess inventories and challenging market conditions in China. The chances are good that Adidas will return to the path of success with Björn Gulden. However, this is likely to take somewhat longer than previously assumed./gl/la      Publication of the original study: 13.02.2023 / 07:49 / CET First disclosure of the original study: 13.02.2023 / 07:58 / CET----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,adidas AG,ADS,DE000A1EWWW0,Equities,Footwear

However, for FY23, the group has guided for a conservative outlook due to an uncertain macroeconomic scenario and announced a new industrial Plan to highlight its commitment to decarbonization.FACT
Revenue: €1,723.1m, up 27%
EBITDA: €335.2m, up 7.8% (€337.2m excluding one-offs)
EBIT: €206.3m, up 4.3%
Guidance for 2023: Revenue of more than €1.8bn, EBITDA at €335-345m, net cash position above €200m, capex ~€113m.
Industrial Plan 2023-2025 announced.ANALYSISCementir Holding has published better than expected FY22 results with revenues up by 27% to €1,723m, driven by price increases across all geographies despite a decrease in volumes sales in all segments. Cement sales decreased by 2.7%, RMC by 5.8% and Aggregates by 5.3%. The general slowdown in the market did not prevent the company from achieving a record EBITDA of €335m (+14.2%), including a one-off positive impact of €17.8m related to real estate. Even after excluding this one-off event, the actual EBITDA is slightly above our expectations. However, the EBITDA margin decreased by 200bp to reach 20.6%. 
Conservative forecast in 2023
The uncertainty of the macroeconomic scenario is forcing the company to be prudent on their outlook for the year 2023. Cementir Holding expects to achieve consolidated revenues of roughly €1.8bn (+4%) with flat growth in EBITDA. Indeed, the company expects a decline in demand resulting in a drop in volume sales, and Cementir would not be able to hike its prices as it did in 2022 unless there is a skyrocketing increase in the carbon price and electricity as the price mechanism of the company is correlated to these costs. However, the company has succeeded in managing its costs and maintaining its margins in 2022 thanks to its strong cost management. We expect Cementir will maintain this efficient cost management in 2023. 
Industrial Plan 2023-2025
The group has updated its Industrial Plan, which revolves around the same pillars as before, but with a further commitment to the decarbonization, less aggressive financial targets for the revenue (CAGR of 5.1% vs 6.7% previously) and a better outlook for EBITDA (CAGR of 5.9% vs 5.3% previously). With additional cumulative green capex of €86m, the company is focusing on projects enabling a reduction in carbon emissions. In our sense, the two key levers to achieve the fit to 55 targets set by EU are (i) clinker content reduction and (ii) Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Cementir has started a pilot project for CCS partly financed by the Danish Innovation Fund and plans to have a clinker ratio of 64% for the grey cement as well as 78% for the white cement by 2030. This puts the company in an advantageous position to address carbon emissions issues.IMPACTFollowing these results, we have updated upwards our model and maintain our positive recommendation. Our target price has been increased by 5% supported by an increase in 2022 EPS (+0.09€), 2023 EPS (+0.08€) and a higher DCF valuation (+0.93€).",© Alphavalue - 2023,Cementir Holding N.V.,CEM,NL0013995087,Equities,Construction Materials

Like-for-like growth of +8.1% in 4Q22 (vs. +7% for the Bloomberg consensus) implies further market share gains in Q4 (notably in China) and a sequential acceleration of three-year growth in Q422. Operating margin is 19.5% for FY22 (+40bp YoY)' says Stifel.' EPS of E11.26 for FY22 is 2% above consensus. Overall, L'Oréal ended 2022 with growth well ahead of the beauty market' adds the analyst firm.Following the announcement of these results, Stifel confirms its Buy recommendation on the stock, with a price target of E405.' We remain buyers of L'Oréal, as the stock is well placed to benefit from a rebound in Chinese domestic consumption and a gradual recovery in overseas travel in 2023 '.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

This also marked the end of a four-day losing streak - at the low for the day right at the start of trading, the loss had totaled ten percent. The current annual gain of the share amounts to around 11 percent, which means that Carl Zeiss lags a little behind the MDax of medium-sized companies.      Due to increased costs and problems in China, the company reported a significant drop in earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) in the first fiscal quarter. In addition to higher expenses for sales and marketing, for example, as well as for research and development, the decline in eye surgeries in China put pressure on the margin, which was even weaker than feared, according to a stock exchange expert. Life came to a standstill in many places in the country due to the Covid outbreak towards the end of 2022.      On the other hand, very strong sales were above the consensus estimate, commented analyst Graham Doyle of Swiss bank UBS. The first quarter is also likely to prove the weakest of the fiscal year. Doyle is betting on a recovery in China and further easing in supply chains, and sees upside potential in the mid-single-digit percentage range for market earnings estimates. He also said there was room for upside in organic sales growth forecasts. The expert maintained his ""buy"" rating with a target price of 156 euros, to which the share has a margin of just under 19 percent./gl/ag/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Carl Zeiss Meditec AG,AFX,DE0005313704,Equities,Advanced Medical Equipment & Technology

UBS analyst Adam Berlin, referring to the latest data on the German housing market, expects demand for real estate to be historically weak this year, according to a study published Wednesday. This is also likely to lead to a decline in transactions in the core areas of the operator of Internet portals, he said.      Prices for houses and apartments are already falling, while at the same time there are more and more properties for sale, it said. Average analyst estimates (consensus) for Scout24 in 2023 are therefore likely to fall, Berlin wrote. However, he has not changed his own estimates, the expert stressed. Therefore, he also left his price target for the share of the MDax-listed company unchanged at 57.30 euros. However, following the 15 percent rise in the share price since the beginning of the year, he now downgraded it from ""buy"" to ""neutral"". From Berlin's point of view, it is thus valued in line with the industry.      Scout24 shares then fell by around 2.8 percent to 52.98 euros and also fell below the 200-day average line as a measure of the longer-term trend.       According to the analyst, however, the growing dependence of brokers on the Immoscout24 online platform, which would have to continue to find buyers in a difficult market environment, speaks in favor of the company. Scout24 would also benefit from advertisements for properties being online on the marketplace for a longer period of time. On top of that, the analyst expects continued strong growth in subscriptions from private individuals. With a so-called Plus membership, users are granted privileges in the search, so that they can, for example, contact the seller or landlord with priority.      Scout24's core business, however, is brokerage memberships, which accounted for nearly half of the group's revenue in the third quarter. In 2023, however, Berlin expects a higher churn of brokers than customers and, as a result, its revenue estimate for this year and next is below consensus. Scout24 plans to present preliminary figures for the final quarter on Feb. 28 and most recently targeted the upper end of its revenue and earnings forecast for 2022 as a whole.      With a rating of ""Neutral"", UBS assumes that the total return of the share (price gain plus dividend) on a twelve-month horizon will be up to six percent above or below the market return expected by UBS./niw/ck/tih  Analyzing institute UBS.

The Group gained +0.1% in supermarket format and +0.1% in convenience, while hypermarkets remained stable, for a total of +0.2%. This level matches that of Leclerc, Aldi and Lidl (+0.2% each). The Group also gained customers over the period (+320k) and recorded strong traffic levels', says the analyst. Oddo also points out that the situation is as bad as ever for Casino, which is losing 0.5% market share. This is broken down into -0.1% from Monoprix and -0.4% from hypermarkets.  We think that management will insist on a rather difficult H1, and a H2 with a priori less inflation and a more favorable basis of comparison, whereas the seasonality of H2 historically accounts for almost two-thirds of ROI,"" adds the research firm. Oddo confirms its Outperform recommendation and its target price of E19, and believes that market share momentum is encouraging. Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

The research firm reports that Q4 results have put the stock under pressure. Oddo highlights two points: i/ an overall cautious guidance for 2023 (although in line with tcc, in our opinion) and ii/ questions about Tolebrutinib. According to Oddo, this year will be the most ""challenging"" for Sanofi, with the loss of the Aubagio patent on the one hand, and the launch of Altuviiio and Beyfortus on the other.""We remain convinced by Sanofi's story, and the recent pressure on the share price accentuates the investment opportunity"", says the broker.  With a PE at a 25% discount to the sector average, the PEG is very attractive. A short-term success for Dupixent in COPD would be the catalyst for the start of a rerating', concludes the analyst.

Covid testing revenue should decline more significantly in 2023 than he thought, analyst Christophe-Raphael Ganet wrote in a research note issued Tuesday. He cut his own assumption for the lab services provider and expects market expectations to fall as well. He also called the expected decline in contribution from acquisitions a disappointment. In addition, production gains would probably be wiped out by inflation. On the negative side, there would also be dilutive effects from direct business with end consumers and a service provider contract in the UK./tav/tih  Publication of the original study: 07.02.2023 / 08:31 / CET First disclosure of the original study: 07.02.2023 / 08:37 / CET----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,SYNLAB AG                                                                                                        Deutsche Boerse AG,SYAB,DE000A2TSL71,Equities,Healthcare Facilities & Services

Following this announcement, Oddo confirms its Outperformance recommendation on the stock, with a target price of E55.' The aim of yesterday's presentation was first and foremost to convince everyone that the governance issues had now been dealt with, that the Alliance was back on a much healthier footing, and that operations could therefore, at last, return to the heart of the discussions after several very difficult years in this respect', says Oddo. The analyst also believes that yesterday's priority was to highlight the Alliance's operational revival through new joint projects.  Above all, we see a desire to take advantage of existing industrial bases (South America, India, Europe) and the strengths of the various partners (product segments, technologies).

This morning, Publicis published its annual results, which came in ahead of expectations, with EBIT of 2,266 ME, against our expectations of 2,233 ME and the consensus of 2,230 ME. Above all, Q4 organic growth was better than expected, coming in at 9.4% vs. +5.1% expected"", says the research firm.

The research firm reports that an agreement in principle on a financial restructuring project has been reached between Orpea and a group of French investors led by Caisse des Dépôts. Orpea states that this 'Groupement' formed around CDC+CNP Assurances+MAIF+MACSF would hold 50.2% of the capital, unsecured debt holders (SteerCo) 49.4%, and current shareholders 0.4%.  The implementation of the envisaged financial restructuring will therefore result in massive dilution for existing shareholders (99% compared to the 90-95% we have been able to mention up to now)', says Oddo. In concrete terms, the restructuring is twofold, says Oddo, with 1/ a conversion of unsecured debt, corresponding to a reduction in gross debt of E3.8 bn with a conversion rate of 30%, and 2/ the contribution of new equity of E1.55 bn. Finally, 'given the pressure on prices (external services, energy, food) or wages, we believe there is a risk to the 2023 projections or even the 2025 guidance presented in November (Sales 25: 6.1 BnE / EBITDAR 25e: 1.25 BnE / EBITDA pre-IFRS 16: 745 ME', concludes the analyst.

In a study published on Tuesday, expert Constantin Hesse upgraded the shares of the car rental company from ""hold"" to ""buy"" and increased the price target from 100 to 130 euros. The shares are currently trading at 114.50 euros.      The travel industry should prove more resilient than expected in 2023, Hesse wrote. Leading indicators are better than initially thought, he said, and continue to signal prices at a high level for the car rental sector, not least because of a still limited availability of vehicles.      Against this backdrop, sentiment has brightened noticeably recently, according to Hesse, if one compares the situation with that of a few weeks ago. Estimates for the economy have probably bottomed out.      In addition, according to Hesse, there has recently been good news for the industry from European airlines, among others. For example, the average load factor forecast for summer 2023 is higher than last year, he said. In addition, some pent-up demand is ensuring robust travel prospects this year as well, he said.      According to the World Tourism Organization, international tourist arrivals this year could reach 80 to 95 percent of pre-Corona pandemic numbers, driven primarily by Europe, the Jefferies expert continued. In 2022, the figure was still only 63 percent, he said.      In line with the ""Buy"" rating, Jefferies analysts expect the shares to achieve a total return (price gain + dividend) of at least 15 percent over a twelve-month period./la/bek/mis      Analyzing institute Jefferies.

This is a good publication, with solid growth in Q4, but above all a margin slightly above expectations, and FCF which should be good. What's more, the tone is reassuring for the start of 2023, and the Group looks set to achieve growth well above the 7% level expected by Consensus, even though the erosion of operating margin is already expected"", reacts Oddo. The broker recalls that in H2 2022, Alten's management expects an MOA at the top end of the previously indicated range (10.2% to 10.5%), which translates into an MOA of around 10.9% for 2022 (Css: 10.8%).Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Analyst Michael Kuhn therefore gave up his buy recommendation after a good run of the papers and downgraded them to ""hold"". Opportunities and risks are now only balanced.      In the share price of the special equipment manufacturer for the chip industry, the conceivable ideal scenario seems to be priced in, argued the expert in a study presented on Wednesday. He therefore sees little room for error, but also does not want to badmouth the prospects. The opportunity for structural growth remains.      The unchanged price target of 33 euros is simply no longer sufficient for a buy recommendation, after the shares had already come quite close to the target. In December, they had reached a high of 32.21 euros since the beginning of 2011. They had approached this level again on Tuesday with a peak of 31.33 euros, so that the distance to the price target was only 1.67 euros or about five percent.      The expert listed two decisive factors that make him generally more cautious for Aixtron: Analyst consensus and the micro-LED business. Analysts had long appreciated the massive growth opportunities in 2022, but expectations have stagnated since September. He sees this as a signal that the air is out in this regard for the time being.      With regard to micro-LED technology, the road could be rocky in 2024. Aixtron has so far only one major order for this technology, which is used, for example, in the production of parts for new types of displays. However, a large part of this is likely to be processed in 2023.

Calculating with 100 Leopard tanks delivered to Ukraine, the additional sales potential from ammunition and spare parts for Rheinmetall could amount to an estimated 1.4 billion euros. Assuming a margin of 25 percent, this would mean an operating profit (Ebit) of €350 million.

Ahead of the annual figures expected in March, analyst Clement Genelot raised his estimates for the online fashion retailer by 15 percent through 2025 in a report available Wednesday. That, he said, reflects a better year-end and a strategic focus on profitability that is likely to continue. The promising path to a 6 percent operating margin in 2025 has been underestimated in the market so far, he said. Also because of short-covering, the impressive doubling of the share price since September 2022 is unlikely to be the end of the road, he argues./tih/ajx  Publication of the original study: 25.01.2023 / 06:00 / Time zone not specified in study.

Oddo estimates that Vinci Airports will post traffic equal to 73.5% of 2019 levels, with a clear improvement at the end of the year (82.7% in December). After +11.7% over 9 months, Oddo expects Vinci Construction sales to rise by 8.2% in Q4. Growth will also continue to be driven by Vinci Energies (+9.3% in Q4) and Cobra IS, adds the research firm.'Overall, we expect sales of €61,170m, operating profit of €6,743m and net income of €4,253m, 30% above 2019 levels', says the broker. According to Oddo, in addition to the good operating performance, Vinci's performance in 2023 could be supported by a better valuation of renewable activities (notably at Cobra IS) with the organization of a dedicated CMD.

UBS has reaffirmed its 'buy' recommendation on Rémy Cointreau, with its price target maintained at 195 euros, a target that implies a 13% upside potential for the wine and spirits house's stock.'Strong brand equity and consumption oriented towards high-income drinkers should make Remy Martin more resilient as we enter a recessionary environment', the broker judges in the summary of its note.For its part, Stifel anticipates the announcement, on January 27, of a decline of around 6% in organic sales in the third accounting quarter, dragged down by cognac in the United States due to the ongoing realignment of sales and a strong basis for comparison.The company has the highest exposure to China among our main European peers, which should finally pay off despite the disruption resulting from the policy reversal on the Covid zero,"" he notes.While reiterating its 'buy' recommendation on Rémy Cointreau, considering that an 'attractive entry point allows for patience', Stifel adjusts its price target from 200 to 197 euros to take into account a weaker dollar.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

This slight increase is largely due to organic sales growth and slightly higher margin assumptions ' says the analyst.Stifel raises its target price to E1,500 and confirms its recommendation to Hold, which implies a target P/E of 40x for 2024, well in line with the average P/E over the last 10 years.' Its high valuation multiple is supported by best-in-class fundamentals and upside risks to the 2023 consensus from accelerating prices and the reopening of China ' explains the analyst firm.' We now forecast operating profit of +17% in Q4 2022 (vs. +15% previously). In Asia-Pacific we expect +15% operating profit, which contrasts with recent declines in the region by companies such as Richemont, Burberry and Boss due to the COVID disruption in China.Stifel now expects +12% gross operating profit for 2023 (vs. +10% previously) supported by high single-digit prices and the expected boost from the reopening of China and the recovery of Chinese outbound travel.' We are now modeling an operating margin of 40.2% for 2023E, up 40 basis points from 39.8% in 2022E, which is not unreasonable for a luxury mega-brand generating over 11 billion euros in sales, with almost half of its sales coming from leather goods ' adds the analyst.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

On March 16th, Swissquote will release its full financial statements as well as the dividend information. All eyes will be on the yield, the revenue contributors and the number of client accounts.FACTFY 22 preliminary results:Net revenues above CHF 400m
Pre-tax profit of at least CHF 185m
Client assets of CHF 52.2bn
Net new monies of CHF 7.7bnANALYSIS2022 now behind us
Swissquote’s preliminary full-year 2022 results were satisfactory, the firm is attaining its guidance objectives (CHF 400-420m net revenues and pre-tax profit of c. CHF 190m).
Note that these objectives had been revised downwards from those released at FY 21 (CHF 475m of net revenues and CHF 225m of pre-tax profit).
These numbers are fully in line with our expectations (Net revenues of CHF 400m and Pre-tax profit of CHF 186m) and should even outperform these depending on the magnitude implied in “Net revenues above CHF 400m” and “pre-tax profit of at least CHF 185m”.
We had been expecting client assets and net new monies of CHF 55bn (+5.3% vs. prelim. figures) and CHF 8.2bn (+6.5% vs. prelim. figures) respectively. The full-year presentation will unveil the number of client accounts, key for the reading of such results.
In fact, these figures imply c. CHF 2.8bn of new monies in H2 22 (-40% yoy) and a decrease of c. 6.6% yoy of client assets.
One question to be answered is whether net new monies have been fed by a constant continued growth in customer accounts or existing clients adding additional funds to their accounts. In our view it was the first option that was behind the increase in net new monies given the mixed performance of financial markets during the second half of the year, impeding individuals’ increased allocation of assets to those offered by Swissquote.
With client assets of c.CHF 51.8bn at the HY 22 and implied net new monies of c. CHF 2.8bn in H2 22, the numbers imply that the markets wiped out c. CHF 2.4bn of assets (c.4.4% of client assets) in the second half of the year (as per CHF 52.2bn of client assets for FY 22).
In contrast, since the obtention of its European license to advertise its products (resulting from the acquisition of KeyTrade Bank), the firm has been aggressively marketing its solutions across Europe and we believe this has been efficient.
An impressive start to 2023
The customer accounts figure will matter as we are believers in the potential for customers to add additional funds to their accounts as they discover the platform but also see more favourable market conditions.
As mentioned above, we see customer growth as dry powder in that we expect them to contribute additional funds under better market conditions. We also believe that, when customers join the platform, they do not directly add the whole amount of money they have allocated to financial markets but rather fund their accounts progressively.
Hence, an uptick in financial markets and a softening in a global recession vs. expected could trigger such new contributions.
Note the following performances of indices and cryptocurrencies YTD:Stoxx 600 c. +5.5%
S&P 500 c. +4.6%
Nasdaq 100 c. +6.25%
BTC c. +24.4%
ETH c. +27.9%A lot can obviously happen throughout the year as the markets remain febrile but any sustained recovery would be positive at least in terms of feeding in additional deposits, which will benefit the firm through interest collected.IMPACTOur figures are fully in line with the preliminary figures, and we will look to update our model following the publication of the full financial statements’.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Swissquote Group Holding Ltd,SQN,CH0010675863,Equities,Financial & Commodity Market Operators

He views the stock's further upside potential as limited after its good run./tih/gl      Publication of the original study: 16.01.2023 / 13:13 / CET First disclosure of the original study: 16.01.2023 / 13:33 / CET----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Zalando SE,ZAL,DE000ZAL1111,Equities,Internet Services

He believes that the very good performance of retailer sales (at 2019 levels), occupancy (95.6%) and reversion (+3% over 9M 2022) are all factors that militate in favor of market rental values capable of roughly keeping pace with inflation.  The real estate company will also be able to rely on assets leased to solid tenants, most of which are located in high-potential catchment areas. Klepierre's debt profile is one of the most attractive of the real estate companies under coverage (average maturity of 6.5 years and LTV of 38.8%), while the portfolio's average yield of 5.2% makes it less sensitive to rising interest rates' says the research firm.  In our opinion, the property company should be able to post steady growth in its dividend over the medium term (TCMA 22e-26e of +4.5%), while maintaining its financial discipline,"" adds Invest Securities.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

We appreciate that it did not have to resort to dilutive instruments.
Since this had been our assumption, no change to our numbers or valuation.
The upside potential remains very significant.FACTCrossject has announced it has raised €14m in debt to finance its expansion.ANALYSISThe group has announced it has reached an agreement with its historical banks (Caisse d’Epargne and BNP) as well as Société Générale and BPI to raise €14m in debt at maturities ranging from 5 to 10 years. This news comes as a relief, since this means that the group has the firepower to finance its expansion for FY2023, with the first product launches expected this year (Emergency Use Utilization) and the likely market approval of Midazolam in the US (FY23 or FY24).
This also confirms the confidence of the banks in the group’s future and will prevent potential further dilution. Lastly, this is in line with the previous statement from the management according to which they will, as far as possible, avoid resorting to dilutive instruments to fuel growth. Note that, to finance the group’s development, the number of outstanding shares has actually steadily risen in the past few years, from 8.8m in FY17 to 36.35m currently. This is thus good news in that there is no risk of shareholders being further diluted.IMPACTNo changes to our numbers following this news since they had already factored in bank financing as opposed to the issuance of new dilutive instruments.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Crossject,ALCJ,FR0011716265,Equities,"Medical Equipment, Supplies & Distribution"

He justified the reduced investment vote for Gea by citing the now balanced risk/reward ratio./edh/ck      Publication of the original study: 11.01.2023 / 22:49 / GMT First circulation of the original study: 12.01.2023 / 05:10 / GMT----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,GEA Group AG,G1A,DE0006602006,Equities,Industrial Machinery & Equipment

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/IDI-5352/news/IDI-Faced-with-macroeconomic-woes-IDI-proves-resilient-42712396/,"IDI  :  Faced with macroeconomic woes, IDI proves resilient","January 11, 2023 at 10:15 am EST","Faced with macroeconomic woes, IDI proves resilientLATESTWhile 6 months ago we published a paper highlighting the difficulties that are expected to disrupt the private equity landscape, we are bullish on IDI’s outlook for the years to come. In the space of a few months, IDI has announced a major transaction with Omnes Capital, and demonstrated the resilience of its NAV (+3.6% YTD) and its ability to create value through its latest sale of the Formalian Group, achieving a significant IRR of 32%.FACT
In H1, IDI announced the acquisition of 100% of Omnes’ private equity and private debt businesses and a 45% stake in the renewable energy business, venture capital and co-investment activities.
In Q3, IDI’s NAV per share reached €82.72, up 3.6% YTD but down 1% qoq (€83.62 in H1 22, IDI only revaluates its liquid and listed assets in Q3).
In 2022, several external growth transactions took place:
Freeland (formerly Newlife) has further strengthened its position in the freelance services market with the acquisition of Codeur in June 2022 and Intervia in October 2022.
CDS Groupe acquired the “Travel” business unit of Rydoo (renamed Goelett) in July 2022.
In the first half of 2022, Dubbing Brothers (European dubbing specialist) made four strategic acquisitions in Europe: Ad Hoc Studios, Interopa, Sedif and Eurotroll.
Flex Composite Group (FCG, formerly ORCA Développement), strengthened its position in the advanced composites market with the acquisition of Selcom in October 2022.
In November 2022, Groupe Positive (formerly Sarbacane) developed its data expertise with the acquisition of Marketing 1BY1.
On December 5, IDI announced the acquisition of Herida Medical by Winncare (a healthcare asset in IDI’s portfolio).
In terms of disposals:
On November 7, IDI announced that it had completed the majority of its investment in Groupe Positive (ex-Sarbacane) and reinvested a portion of the proceeds alongside EMZ, achieving a net investment multiple of 3.1x and a net IRR of 70%.
On December 19, 2022, IDI completed its latest exit, selling Formalian for an investment multiple of nearly 3x and an IRR of 32%.ANALYSISThe Private Equity landscape
The Private Equity universe has been a hot topic since the beginning of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical crisis. In our last sector note we mentioned Amundi’s CIO claiming that private equity could be a “big bubble” akin to a Ponzi scheme, the chairwoman of the FTC alluding to possible regulations, the US antitrust authority, Linda Khan, willing to dig into anticompetitive practices and the scares caused by rising interest rates along with the withdrawal of banks from the sector.
Omnes acquisition marks a new chapter for IDI
Despite these headwinds, private equity players, including IDI, are proving resilient. On September 12, IDI opened a new chapter in third-party management with the acquisition of 100% of Omnes’s private equity and private debt business and 45% of Omnes’ renewable energy, venture capital and co-investment activities. This significant transaction will double IDI’s third-party management size to approximately €1.5 billion AuM (which includes the $620m AuM of IDI Emerging Markets).
Resilient Q3 results and solid disposals
While there was a slight 1% decline in the NAV from €83.62 in H1 22 to €82.72 in Q3 22 with the drop in the IHS valuation (African Tower Co), investors shouldn’t worry about the NAV progression in 2022. It is worth mentioning that IDI only revalued liquid and listed assets, including IHS, in Q3 (not the unlisted assets). Furthermore, the NAV is up 3.6% YTD, and growth should have remained in positive territory for 2022, a feat given the unfavourable macroeconomic environment. While it is true that the environment is increasingly adverse, IDI is not showing any fragility on the portfolio rotation side. In November 2022, IDI realized the majority of its investment in Groupe Positive (ex-Sarbacane) and reinvested a portion of the proceeds alongside EMZ, achieving a net investment multiple of 3.1x and an impressive net IRR of 70% over 2 years. On December 19, 2022, IDI sold its entire stake in the Formalian group to the Caille family’s investment holding company, Vivalto SAS. This last transaction allowed IDI to realize a cash-on-cash multiple of nearly 3x and an IRR of 32%, which is in line with the historical multiples realized by IDI. Although Formalian and Groupe Positive do not, in our view, represent a significant portion of the NAV, these latest transactions bode well for IDI’s ability to make disposals at attractive levels.
Positive outlook despite the challenging environment
With the NAV up 3.6% YTD and the current 42% discount to NAV, IDI looks increasingly compelling. Furthermore, we see the Omnes deal as positive since the HoldCo will diversify its revenues and pocket a regular source of income. IDI should also benefit from a size effect for future deals. Finally, despite the challenging environment, IDI is doing well as evidenced by its last two exits. If financing is scarce, IDI can count on a professional team, a quality portfolio and privileged relationships with funds to overcome the economic downturn. In short, IDI is well positioned to surmount the challenges ahead.IMPACTWe will revise our NAV estimate following the publication of the annual results in March 2022 and incorporate the Omnes acquisition at that time. The essential figures concerning Omnes are effectively yet to be made available to assess the full impact on IDI’s new balance of business which is likely to be more labour intensive.",© Alphavalue - 2023,IDI,IDIP,FR0000051393,Equities,Investment Management & Fund Operators

Analyst Chetan Udeshi addressed the earnings sensitivity of European chemical companies in the context of the recent significant drop in energy prices in an industry report available Friday. Because of the current weakness in demand and some energy cost surcharges that have been introduced in the past 18 months, most companies are likely to pass on most, if not all, of the potential cost savings to their customers, he wrote. BASF, Lanxess and Covestro may benefit from lower energy prices sooner because they have not hedged their energy costs./edh/la  Publication of the original study: 05.01.2023 / 21:36 / GMT First disclosure of the original study: 06.01.2023 / 00:15 / GMT----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,BASF SE,BAS,DE000BASF111,Equities,Diversified Chemicals

At the end of December, the CPN (Commission des provisions nucléaires) asked Engie to increase its provisions for decommissioning and long-term management of nuclear fuel by E3.3 billion, compared with an initial proposal of E900 million, reports the broker, which has finally retained E2 billion in its assumptions at this stage. The analyst's office points out that a forum provided an opportunity to return to the question of extending the lifespan of the two Belgian nuclear power plants. On this subject, ""the prospects of an agreement seem to be falling into place"", says Oddi, which points out that Engie wishes to place these plants and the extension capex on an equal footing in a JV with the Belgian federal state.""For 2022, the Group will recognize in Q4 2022 the retroactive impact of infra-marginal taxes on nuclear power for an estimated amount of ME500. For 2023, an additional charge of 700 ME is expected, which leads us to lower our estimates for the nuclear division', concludes Oddo. Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

With an increase of 2.1 percent to 206.40 euros, they topped the MDax and reached their highest level since the beginning of July. This represents a weekly gain of eleven percent.      In trading, reference was made to the foreseeable inclusion of Rheinmetall shares in the Dax, which provided latent support for the share price. The major French bank Societe Generale (SocGen) had already indicated the day before that a delisting of the Linde share was to be expected in the course of the first quarter and that Rheinmetall was expected to succeed it in Germany's leading Dax index.      On the other hand, the political decision to supply the Marder infantry fighting vehicle to Ukraine was cited on Tuesday. This fed speculation that the Marder could be followed at some point by the Leopard main battle tank, despite all political concerns./bek/mis",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Rheinmetall AG,RHM,DE0007030009,Equities,Aerospace & Defense

For the 2022/2023 financial year, the Group did not give any quantified targets, but nevertheless continued to state that demand for motorhomes remains buoyant, and that trade shows are going well (attendance in Germany, Italy, France and the UK).""On this basis, we note in particular that the order backlog is saturating production capacity for 2023"", says Oddo, for whom ""given the price increases achieved in 2022, the Group should be able to stabilize its profitability level in 2023"".All in all, this publication confirms the broker's investment rationale, namely good visibility on the business given the size of the order book, good resilience of margins due to price increases in 2022/2023, and a very favorable balance sheet situation.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Vosser recommends quality stocks for 2023. He reduced his 2023 estimates for the sector only slightly, as it is likely to retain its high premium at least during the recession worries. On laboratory supplier Sartorius, Vosser wrote that it and subsidiary Stedim Biotech should continue to benefit from strong demand in the BPS (Bioprocess Solutions) business area.

Last night, GTT announced the end of direct contracts with Russia, as a consequence of sanctions packages n°8 and n°9 targeting Moscow. As a reminder, GTT has a direct contract with a Russian shipyard, Zvezda Shipbuilding Complex, for the design of tanks for 15 ice-breaking LNG carriers currently under construction, as well as for the design of 3 GBSs. As of October 1, sales of 74 ME remained to be recognized for the ice-breaking LNG carriers by 2025, and 12 ME for the GBSs by 2027. This represents a total of 86 ME, or less than 6% of the order book"", says GTT.In this context, Oddo indicates that the 2023 EBITDA estimate should be around 200 ME (vs. 230 ME currently), still showing an increase of more than 30% Y-o-Y. ""For 2024, the impact would be more limited insofar as our current estimates are conservative with regard to the dynamics of orders booked during the 2nd half of 2022.
