Yesterday, the stock was heckled on the stock market (-8.7% in Paris), despite very good results, a reaction that Oddo BHF felt was 'very exaggerated', especially as the lowered outlook for second-half gross margin (MB) was already known.  The main reason [for this drop] is the fear of a slowdown in the market and a reversal in the price dynamic, which until now has supported margins"", says the analyst, who nevertheless points out that ""beyond this one-off drop, the Group is still targeting an MB of 50%, based on sales of $20 billion by 2025/27"".With sales coming in at $4.25 bn, slightly above consensus at $4.2 bn, up 19.8% yoy and down 4% qoq vs. a guidance of -5.1%, Oddo BHF is raising its 2023 EPS by 4%.

The previous day, they had already reacted in late trading with significant losses to the fact that the annual outlook was lowered due to the decline in prices for biodiesel and higher costs. Now the share price slumped again by almost 13 percent to 30.50 euros. That marked the lowest level since March 2021, and the shares are by far the worst performer in the SDax small-cap index, down by about half for the year.      According to a statement on Thursday, the company expects an operating profit (Ebitda) of only 240 million euros in fiscal 2022/23. Previously, the target had been 300 million euros. It did not help on Friday that analysts reacted relatively calmly. Stifel expert Adrian Pehl described the warning in a study as not unexpected and Deutsche Bank analyst Niklas Becker considers the long-term story to be intact. Despite cuts, the two experts remain with price targets of at least 50 euros well above the current price./tih/jha/----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Verbio SE,VBK,DE000A0JL9W6,Equities,Renewable Fuels

This fact prompts the analyst to raise his expectations (+1.6% at the level of 2023-25th NBI). Invest also points out that Alten's quality is well established and that market conditions remain favorable, 'particularly in the automotive, aerospace and defense sectors'.  On the other hand, M&A is unlikely to provide support in the short term, with fierce competition from PE funds reducing opportunities and limiting Alten to small-scale acquisitions (< 50mE in sales)' adds the analyst, who is therefore revising his target downwards, despite the slight increase in his expectations.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

The results, which the exchange operator had presented the previous evening after the close of the stock exchange and initially convinced investors, thus receded into the background. In Tradegate trading, the shares were down 1.1 percent compared with the Xetra closing price on the previous day. In off-market trading yesterday evening, the shares were already up almost two percent at their peak.      One trader stressed that the first quarter results had initially been strong, but then took a negative view of the takeover announcement because of the valuation and the financing conditions required for it. Compared to Simcorp's closing price the previous day, which was 529 Danish kroner, the exchange operator is paying a 39 percent premium at 735 kroner. In the first quarter, Deutsche Börse had continued to benefit from brisk trading on the equity and commodity markets and higher interest rates. Thanks to the strong start, the Group is now somewhat more optimistic about the current year./tih/stk----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Deutsche Börse AG,DB1,DE0005810055,Equities,Financial & Commodity Market Operators

In Tradegate trading, the securities gained 1.4 percent in pre-market compared to the Xetra closing price to 9.69 euros.      At first glance, the past quarter was better than expected, said a trader. He also referred to planned share buybacks and more significant cost reductions than initially communicated.      The shares had recently come under renewed pressure as the crisis at US regional banks flared up again and slipped below ten euros. They are currently still trading below this level, but in Xetra trading could again exceed the 21-day line for the short-term trend.      JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein called the figures nevertheless mixed. He said corporate banking was strong, but investment banking and retail banking were weaker than expected. The focus is also likely to be on customer outflows.      In the U.S., the troubled regional bank First Rebublic had reported this week on a large withdrawal of customer funds in the first quarter, whereupon the share price had plunged by 65 percent within two days./ajx/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Deutsche Bank AG,DBK,DE0005140008,Equities,Banks

In addition, Teleperformance management has slightly adjusted its expectations for the full year, indicating that it expects organic sales growth of around +7% (vs. over 7% initially), while the MOP target has been raised to 16% (vs. 15.7% previously).  All in all, the guidance adjustment for 2023 is rather neutral on our EPS. The adjustment of -2.2% on average over 2023-2024 is linked to an unfavorable currency effect (USD)', concludes Oddo BHF.

According to the analyst, in a context where investors remain deaf to risks such as the euro's recovery, it's not surprising that Kering remains modestly valued in relative terms.""Kering's problem is that it is confronted with factors that are specific to it, including a relaunch of the Gucci brand that has yet to be promoted, mistakes in Balenciaga's marketing that are difficult to admit, and a certain loss of steam at BV and YSL"", judges Invest. Conversely, Kering's peers are riding on 'impressive momentum', which leads the analyst to wonder whether LV, Christian Dior and Hermes are not benefiting from direct transfers of market share. In the meantime, 2023 is likely to be, at best, a transitional year for Kering, with a heightened downside sensitivity factor should the economy deteriorate, which we believe is likely in the USA, if not in Europe"", concludes the analyst.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

While it firmly stuck to its top-line objectives, margins were squeezed by fast(er) rising costs and a €4m mighty provisioning for a refoundation of its MAC division (windows, awnings, etc.). Accelerated capex is to follow. Earnings dropped by c. a third to €22m. We were banking on €26.8m. While management confirms its entrepreneurial skills (more capex, a stream of useful acquisitions, proactive deployment of ESG metrics), our 2023 earnings expectations need to be trimmed.FACTSFPI published a net profit down 33% on sales up 10.5%, or 7% pro forma. The following table provides the detail with discussion in the Analysis section below.
Despite a sharply-contracting FCF generation (on account of working capital needs), the balance sheet remains remarkably healthy with a €25m net cash position.
Dividend is trimmed to €0.05 from €0.08 in 2021 to reflect lower earnings.ANALYSISIn a summary analysis, SFPI’s earnings gave way to higher materials costs (gross margin down to 57.4% from 59.5%) and a €4m one-off to rejig the MAC business. The payroll looks comparably under control.
The gross margin erosion is above our mid-year expectations and somewhat at odds with the ongoing talk of (admittedly much larger) capital goods and construction materials stocks. Ergo, SFPI’s bargaining power is less. Its MAC division notably suffered a 4% drop in its gross margin to 52.4%. There is only so much that one can expect to pass through to consumers.
The €4m provision aimed at rethinking MAC’s industrial operations covers an inside-out review of the 11 industrial sites to optimise productivity, logistics and working conditions. This will be complemented by faster capex plans up to 2025. This rejigging of industrial assets strikes us as indicative of SFPI tightening up of its management of of its industrial assets, with upgrades to industrial tools and working practices now required to defend margins. Productivity gains can be substantial as the MAC industrial set-up was not optimal.  Underlying markets for MAC (housing renovation, amply subsidised) do not seem to be an issue. However pro forma sales up 10% have been driven by prices, indicating that end markets may not accept much more and that indeed MAC needs to work on its costs. Separately, it may be that the discretionary bit of MAC’s offer (blinds, awnings) starts to feel even more the pressure of households’ tighter pockets.
Other divisions fared comparably a bit better. DOM (everything about locks) wrote down assets for €3.7m but continued to invest in new technologies such as cloud-based access control. On the industrial front, Neu-JFK (HVAC systems for air cleaning) made brisk business out of heat exchangers that were sought after in the energy crisis. MMD (heat exchangers and sterilisation (pasteurisation) lines) also held its turf well and closed the year with still very strong orderbooks.
Balance sheet: only a bit less comfortable
SFPI is driven utterly cautiously, and rightly so. The surge in working capital requirement, in capex and an eroding EBITDA have bitten sharply into the net cash position which retreats to €25m vs. €75m a year earlier. This was bound to happen as SFPI had to pay up or shut up vis a vis suppliers which not only raised prices above their own inflation but also argued that they were short of goods. Hopefully, such excesses on the part of suppliers will be down. As a reminder, higher prices do inflate inventories too and bite in working capital terms.IMPACTThe FY2022 management comments suggest that the company is on a strong footing but will firm up that footing even more by investing more heavily into a simpler industrial set-up where needed, in spite of the near-term cash costs. AlphaValue tends to hold a positive view of businesses with a keen eye on preparing for their future. A methodological group approach to ESG matters seems to have helped unveil corners of the business which could do with upgrades. This may lead the small industrial conglomerate to move on to tigher management of its assets, i.e. with a keener search for synergies. It is unlikely to be anything but positive. In the meantime, our forecasts clearly need to be trimmed for 2023 by c. 15%.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Groupe SFPI,SFPI,FR0004155000,Equities,Construction Supplies & Fixtures

Analyst Dirk Schlamp said he is confident that demand for mobility services will continue to develop positively in the current year, as the desire to travel is quite robust despite high inflation and economic concerns. He sees the biggest risk to his earnings forecasts on the price side, as the predictability of business development in the second half of the year is limited and the availability of new vehicles is improving, the expert wrote in a study available on Thursday. The new fair value is based on a return on investment/cost of capital calculation, taking into account his current estimates./edh/la      Publication of the original study: 20.04.2023 / 16:22 / CET First disclosure of the original study: 20.04.2023 / 16:35 / CET----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Sixt SE,SIX2,DE0007231326,Equities,"Passenger Transportation, Ground & Sea"

The papers of the IT service provider fell by around 2 percent to 103.60 euros by the afternoon. The small cap index SDax fell by 0.46 percent.      Most recently, the shares had benefited from the presentation of the financial figures for 2022 and the announcement of a share buyback. On Thursday, the focus was on the IT service provider's first capital market day. On this occasion, Nagarro wants to present its future corporate strategy, the expert Martin Comtesse from the analysis firm Jefferies had already emphasized on Monday.      But with Nagarro now just like with the capital market meetings of the dialysis provider Fresenius Medical Care and the car rental company Sixt in this week the hoped for positive news could have failed to materialize, a trader justified the price losses.       Market expert Andreas Lipkow added: ""Some profit-taking can be seen in the shares of Nagarro."" After the price increases of the last trading days, the price development lost some momentum./la/he----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Nagarro SE,NA9,DE000A3H2200,Equities,IT Services & Consulting

Since his upgrade, he said, the stock has risen significantly and outperformed the Dax, although management has significantly lowered its 2023 earnings targets./ajx/ck      Publication of the original study: 20.04.2023 / 08:15 / CEST.

At broker Lang & Schwarz, the shares of the laboratory equipment manufacturer slipped 4.9 percent to 367.50 euros in pre-market trading. In Xetra trading, this would be the lowest price since the beginning of January.      A trader said that Sartorius had significantly missed expectations in all key figures. The currency-adjusted drop in order intake by almost one-third was shocking. Analysts had already anticipated a weaker first quarter, but not to this extent, the trader said.      In the first quarter of the year, the DAX-listed group fell well short of its prior-year figures. Because customers reduced their inventories and the corona business now hardly makes a contribution, sales declined. In addition, higher costs resulted in weaker profitability./ajx/mis----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Sartorius AG,SRT3,DE0007165631,Equities,Advanced Medical Equipment & Technology

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/TUI-AG-470539/news/Fresh-investor-money-does-not-make-Tui-more-valuable-43533768/,Fresh investor money does not make Tui more valuable,"April 18, 2023 at 11:25 am EDT","FRANKFURT (dpa-AFX) - Despite a growing appetite for travel in the wake of the Corona crisis, the share price of tourism group Tui is going downhill. In the wake of a long-announced capital increase to repay state aid, the securities went down to a record low of 5.836 euros on Tuesday. The fresh money from investors was practically pulverized in recent weeks.      By issuing around 329 million new shares, Tui raised 1.8 billion euros as planned, according to a spokesman. The travel company got rid of the last nine percent of these shares on Tuesday with a so-called short placement - at 5.60 euros per share. On the stock exchange, the old shares were last traded above the 6 euro mark in the afternoon at 6.41 euros. By way of comparison, five years ago the price was more than 60 euros, adjusted for the various capital measures, according to Bloomberg.      Adding up the value of the shares, which will in future total slightly more than half a billion, the Tui Group is now valued on the stock exchange at a total of just under 3.3 billion euros. This is practically the same as at the beginning of December, before Tui announced the capital increase that has now been completed. This was also preceded by a consolidation of the previous shares at a ratio of ten to one: Those who previously held ten shares now only had one. Five years ago, the Group was worth just under twelve billion euros; before the Corona pandemic at the end of 2019, it was worth around seven billion euros.      Capital increases are now nothing new for Tui shareholders. After all, the current one was already the fourth since the beginning of the Corona crisis. At that time, travel restrictions as a result of the pandemic had temporarily brought the travel business to a complete standstill, and the German state saved the travel giant from going under with financial injections worth billions.      In the meantime, the vacation business is up and running again, and Tui intends to use the money from the current capital increase to repay the last of the aid money. This should significantly shrink the company's mountain of debt and thus its future interest burden.      However, industry expert Jamie Rollo of investment bank Morgan Stanley advised investors last week to continue avoiding Tui shares. His colleague Oliver Wojahn of Alsterresearch, on the other hand, saw the recent drop in the share price as an opportunity to enter the market. He attributes a price target of 18 euros to the papers. To achieve this, the price would have to roughly triple from the current perspective.      One crux of the capital raising this time was the exclusion of Tui's long-time major shareholder Alexei Mordashov, who before the capital increase still held slightly more than 30 percent of Tui shares. The Russian oligarch had played a major role in previous capital measures, helping to save the Group during the pandemic.      However, as a result of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, he is no longer allowed to invest in Tui. This is because the EU had placed Mordashov on its sanctions list at the end of February 2022. According to voting rights notifications, he transferred the lion's share of his shares to his wife Marina Mordashova via an investment company.      According to Tui, however, this transfer is ""pending invalid"" - because the German Federal Ministry of Economics initiated an investigation under the Foreign Trade and Payments Act just over a year ago. The capital increase significantly reduces the share of the Russian investor.      Tui's management tried to allay investors' concerns at the beginning of April with the news that it would itself participate in the capital increase. Accordingly, the members of the Executive Board have exercised their subscription rights in full. Supervisory Board Chairman Dieter Zetsche reportedly subscribed to 8600 new shares, and with around 28,800 shares he is already the largest shareholder of all members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board./stw/zb/he",© dpa-AFX - 2023,TUI AG,TUI1,DE000TUAG505,Equities,Leisure & Recreation

This event could provide an opportunity to obtain further details on the strategic agenda, i.e. the timing of the sale of Editis and the finalization of the Lagardère acquisition, and above all the company's plan for share cancellations, which are expected to run from July to September"", stresses Oddo.

This decision is based on his caution regarding the overall economic development. High inflation, high interest rates and current list prices all pose risks to car affordability and consequently sales. In addition, the sector index has significantly outperformed since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, the expert favors Mercedes-Benz over BMW.

In a study available on Monday, Berenberg analyst Gustav Froberg pointed to a recovery in business with medium-sized and small companies (SMB business) at the MDax software group. This recovery is being overlooked by many investors, he said, as they are far too fixated on the problems of the past.      As a result, Froberg upgraded Teamviewer shares from ""hold"" to ""buy"" and also raised the price target sharply from 14.50 to 21.00 euros. This is the highest price target of all analysts covered by dpa-AFX who cover Teamviewer. At the start of the week, the stock benefited enormously from this and moved to the top of the MDax. The recovery in the share price, which had been faltering since mid-February, gained fresh momentum after the stock climbed above 16 euros. There were already signs of recovery in Teamviewer's SMB business in the final quarter, as the figures for 2022 showed some time ago.      In general, Froberg praised Teamviewer's customer structure: large customers (enterprise customers) with larger contracts than those of SMB customers represented twenty percent of total billings, i.e., billed revenues, but less than one percent of the total customer base. The expert sees great potential for future price increases here. He also rated margins and free cash flow as sustainable.      Teamviewer was one of the big beneficiaries of the Corona pandemic, but then took on too much, among other things, with an expensive sponsorship agreement with the English soccer club Manchester United. At the end of 2022, however, Teamviewer negotiated an exit option from the expensive shirt sponsorship deal with the Premier League club. Froberg believes that a possible earlier exit could provide further tailwind for the Teamviewer share.      Analyst Froberg sees additional price drivers in the upcoming annual report for the first quarter of the year at the beginning of May, as well as in the presentation of figures for the second quarter in August. Froberg believes that investors will increasingly recognize the turnaround at Teamviewer. He therefore sees this as an attractive time to buy the stock, especially since Teamviewer is one of the most favorably valued shares in the industry in Europe.      With a ""Buy"" recommendation, Berenberg sees a sustainable price potential of more than 15 percent for the stock over a twelve-month period.

The biotech company announced final five-year follow-up results from a Phase II trial of the drug Monjuvi plus lenalidomide (L-MIND), which was positively assessed by two traders.

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/IDI-5352/news/IDI-FY22-IDI-in-a-solid-stand-amidst-an-adverse-environment-43481273/,IDI  :  FY22: IDI in a solid stand amidst an adverse environment,"April 13, 2023 at 02:12 am EDT","FY22: IDI in a solid stand amidst an adverse environmentEARNINGS/SALES RELEASESAfter a record-breaking FY2021, IDI enjoyed another solid and active year with NAV per share up 12%. This strong momentum was driven both by the robust operating performance of its portfolio companies against an inflationary backdrop (i) and disposals at attractive terms (ii). 2022 proved to be a milestone year in the equity story of IDI, which has decided to strengthen its presence in third-party management with the acquisition of Omnes’ private equity and private debt activities under the newly created entity, IdiCo. While IDI is resilient in the face of macroeconomic headwinds, prudence remains the watchword. FACTKey FY22 figuresIDI’s NAV reached €673m at the end of FY22. The NAV per share stood at €89.45, up 12% yoy, corresponding to a significant 40.9% discount to NAV based on the current share price.  
Although below the €126.2m achieved in the peak year 2021, IDI recorded an impressive net result of €80.4m, well above the €32.4m of 2020.
The company’s total liquidity position stood at €124m at the end of 2021, down 13.8% yoy, with €60m of credit lines (€30m drawn in Q1 23) and a €5m overdraft facility.
In 2022, IDI completed 15 transactions including 1 acquisition, 10 build-ups, 2 disposals, 1 reinvestment and the Omnes deal.   
The major strategic transaction with Omnes was completed on March 23, 2023. IDI acquired 40% in Omnes’ renewable energy, venture capital and co-investment activities, and a 100% stake in IdiCo which regroups Omnes’ small, lower, mid cap private equity and private debt activities.
In terms of dividends, IDI has proposed a dividend of €2.5 per share or 2.8% of NAV and 4.57% of its average share price for 2022.ANALYSISStrong performance in a hostile private equity environment
While our HoldCo universe has not been spared by the equity market downturn and the hostile 2022 environment, IDI has proven resilient with NAV up 12% yoy to €673m (vs €611m) or €89.45 per share. A notable feat in today’s climate explained by (i) the excellent operational performances of the portfolio companies in the face of inflationary pressures and  (ii) the active investment activity in 2022. 
IDI’s investment activity was buoyant in 2022, with 15 deals completed, including one acquisition, ten build-ups, two disposals, one reinvestment and the signature of the agreement with Omnes. In terms of exits also, IDI is thriving regardless of the current environment, with notably the sale of the SaaS software publisher Groupe Positive (ex-Sarbacane), which allowed IDI to record a cash-on-cash multiple of 3.1x and a net IRR of more than 70%, and the sale of Formalian for a multiple of 3x and an IRR of 32%. The healthy performance of the Private Equity business in Europe allowed the HoldCo to post a significant result from investment activities of €94.2 million, below the €146 million recorded in the exceptional year of 2021, but well above the €40 million recorded in 2020.
A new era impelled by the Omnes acquisition
If 2022 was a busy year for investments, 2023 is also shaping up nicely for IDI, which has already completed 4 deals: the external growth of Talis Education into the Fore group and 2 disposals, including that of Freeland, the French leader in services to the self-employed, to MML Capital, enabling IDI to achieve a solid investment multiple of 2.2x and an IRR of c. 24% in less than 4 years.
The biggest deal in 2023, however, remained the acquisition of a significant stake (>40%) in Omnes’ renewable energy, venture capital and co-investment businesses (representing €5bn of AuM) and 100% of IdiCo, a newly-created entity that combines Omnes’ private equity and private debt businesses. IdiCo is designed to be IDI’s new European third-party management arm, managing €1bn of AuM. The transaction, which closed on March 23, 2023 instead of in the expected Q4-22, totally transforms IDI in that it will double the size of IDI’s third-party management business to €1.5 billion in assets under management (including $620 million for Emerging Markets IDI). Although no figures have been disclosed, the deal will change IDI’s financial statements in terms of revenues, with stable management fees and some performance fees on IdiCo’s fee-paying AuM. In terms of costs, we expect the transaction to result in an increase in personnel costs owing to some 30 additional people according to our estimates. We see the transaction as a way for IDI to leverage its size in investment opportunities. Details of the transaction and integration dates have not yet been disclosed although, according to sources in Les Echos, Omnes has an enterprise value of around €120m.
Looking ahead to 2023 
In terms of outlook, despite the acquisition of Omnes, IDI’s core business remains direct investment in SMEs/ITCs, with a target of 12 to 15 companies in its portfolio. The company does not limit itself in terms of sectors but rather looks for opportunities. In view of its growing balance sheet, IDI expects to invest in tickets above €25m with co-investments of up to €100m.
Although the macroeconomic context is unfavorable, IDI can pride itself on a portfolio of quality companies with a degree of pricing power. Moreover, in an environment of rising interest rates and difficult financing, IDI has the financial strength and privileged relationships to face the challenges.  Valuation-wise as well, the HoldCo looks attractive with a 41% discount to NAV at present. Finally, we see the acquisition of Omnes as being positive for IDI, which will be able to (i) diversify its revenues (ii) pocket a steady stream of income from stable management fees (iii) position itself on larger tickets with a scale effect (iv) share competencies between IDI and Omnes managers and (v) create synergies in the field of ESG. However, even if IDI is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead, caution remains our watchword for the comprehensive PE industry as the tightening in financial condition at a precipitated clip in 2022 will inevitably take its toll in 2023.
Making progress on the ESG front
On the ESG front, IDI has strengthened its commitment with the creation of an ESG committee at the supervisory board level. 2022 marked the formalization of IDI’s ESG approach, which is integrated into the entire investment cycle from due diligence, to the investment decision and the investment agreement, to the management of IDI’s holdings. Finally, in line with the objectives of the PRI, to which IDI has become a signatory, IDI is in the process of setting up an effective reporting system. By 2023, IDI intends to establish its first carbon footprint (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) measurements at both the holding and the portfolio company level. IMPACTWe will revalue the underlying companies to estimate our NAV with the revision of the listed peer group multiples. We will incorporate the FY22 numbers into our model and roll forward our estimates to 2025 taking into account the Omnes acquisition which brings a significant twist to the original business model (third party money, more staff). The strong FY22 results continue to support our positive stance on the stock even if we remain dubious about private equity players in the prevailing context.",© Alphavalue - 2023,IDI,IDIP,FR0000051393,Equities,Investment Management & Fund Operators

At last count, they were up 0.3 percent at 49.27 euros - struggling with the 50-day as well as the 100-day line, which are indicators of medium- to longer-term price trends.      The chemicals group had reported a surprisingly sharp drop in sales in the first three months of the year - but operating earnings before interest and taxes (adjusted EBIT), adjusted for special items, did not fall as sharply as feared. According to market expert Andreas Lipkow, the figures ""give a very good indication of both the effects of inflationary dynamics from the last few months of trading and the economic slowdown and restraint on the part of customers.""/gl/he----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,BASF SE,BAS,DE000BASF111,Equities,Diversified Chemicals

This is because trading in the subscription rights from the travel group's capital increase ends this Wednesday. In the morning in Xetra main trading, the price of the subscription rights fell by more than a third to 1.21 euros compared to the Xetra close the previous day - continuing the strong fluctuations in trading so far.      On the London Stock Exchange, where the vast majority of subscription rights and also Tui shares are traded, the Tui share price fell by 1.6 percent to 5.77 pounds. With the start of the capital increase at the end of March, the papers had collapsed below the 10-pound mark, at the low to around 5.40 pounds.      Analyst Jamie Rollo of the investment bank Morgan Stanley had advised the previous day to continue to avoid Tui shares. The expert expects a weak reception of the new shares by investors. The sharp drop in the price of the subscription rights is likely to prove him right in this respect. The result would be a large overhang of shares, which would put latent pressure on the share price in the future, according to Rollo.      So far, the subscription rights business on the German market has been very volatile. On the first trading day on Xetra at the end of March, the price rose from 5.55 euros to as high as 6.99 euros. Subsequently, the price fell to 84 cents amid strong fluctuations. On the Thursday before the long Easter weekend, the price shot up by almost 160 percent to 2.87 euros; on Tuesday, it fell again by around 35 percent. Every trading day, an average of just under five million subscription rights changed hands on Xetra.      According to the prospectus for the capital increase, trading in subscription rights on the Frankfurt and Hanover stock exchanges ends at midday. On the London Stock Exchange, on the other hand, the securities will be traded until the close of trading./bek/gl/ngu----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,TUI AG,TUI1,DE000TUAG505,Equities,Leisure & Recreation

So far, the subscription rights business has been very volatile: On the first trading day on Xetra at the end of March, the price rose from 5.55 euros to a peak of 6.99 euros. Subsequently, the price dropped sharply to 84 cents amid strong fluctuations. On the Thursday before the long Easter weekend, the price shot up by almost 160 percent to 2.87 euros, but on Tuesday it fell again by around 35 percent. Every trading day, an average of just under five million subscription rights changed hands on Xetra.       According to the prospectus for the capital increase, trading in subscription rights on the Frankfurt and Hanover stock exchanges ends at midday. On the London Stock Exchange, on the other hand, the securities will be traded until the close of trading./bek/zb----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,TUI AG,TUI1,DE000TUAG505,Equities,Leisure & Recreation

He attributed the best chances to classifieds portals due to their strong pricing power and additional revenue streams.

Analyst Marcus Diebel pointed to the lowered consensus estimates, expansion plans in the promising ready-to-eat (RTE) business, the attractive valuation and the limited risks for further share price losses in a study available on Tuesday.      Therefore, the expert raised the share by two investment levels from ""Underweight"" to ""Overweight"". He raised the price target from EUR 18 to EUR 27, which is almost 16 percent above the current valuation level.      Due to the reluctance of customers in the traditional business with cooking boxes, he welcomed the rapid and strategic entry of the company into the more promising RTE area, Diebel explained. The main segment around the distribution of cooking boxes had long been the main reason for his cautious assessment of the stock. To be sure, he said, some cannibalization effects between the two segments are to be expected. But average expectations, as well as his estimates, were well below management's 2025 targets, and a disappointing first half of 2023 was already generally expected, he said. After the recent decline in the share price, the risk of further losses is also within bounds. Diebel justified the new price target with his raised sales expectations.      According to the ""Overweight"" rating, JPMorgan expects the share to outperform the respective sector in the coming six to twelve months.

Analyst George Galliers therefore lowered in a study presented on Thursday the price targets of numerous car stocks and downgraded the shares of BMW and Volvo Cars. Better chances he admits only the sports car manufacturers Porsche AG, Ferrari and Aston Martin, for which he increased the price targets.      So far, there is little evidence of industry-leading products from European electric car makers when considering overall powertrain efficiency, Galliers wrote. At best, efficiency can match Tesla's, but in many cases it is below it. In addition, he said, Tesla's reported gross margins (around 27 percent in 2022) are much higher than those of European manufacturers. This suggests that the technology gap could be even wider, he said.      Galliers believes that while European e-car producers can continue to compete effectively, and that their core competencies continue to offer competitive advantages. However, the European automotive industry - if it wants to retain its strong position - must in the future manufacture products that set new industry standards for powertrain efficiency, the expert urged.

Oddo has slightly adjusted its forecasts for the 1st quarter, with y/y cc growth at -2% for Gucci (vs. -4% previously) and +6% for Saint Laurent (vs. +4% previously). It is also reducing its forecasts for Bottega Veneta from +4% to +1% and for Other Houses from -5% to -7%, ""resulting in final group growth of -1% versus -2% previously reported"", says the broker. Oddo also points out that taking into account more unfavorable exchange rates for 2023 leads to a -1% reduction in its sales estimates for 2023/2024/2025.  All in all, our new EBIT estimates are down -1%/-2% on previous estimates', says the research firm, which adds that the share is still trading at a discount of just over 30% at this stage to the LVMH sector benchmark.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Following this transaction, Oddo confirms its Neutral recommendation on the value, with a target of 346 E.' According to the press release, Aësop's EV is 2525 ME and sales have reached 537 ME in 2022, representing an EV/Sales22 of 4.7x. The Group gives no indication of the level of operating margin. But if we assume an operating margin of between 20% and 25%, this would give an EV/EBITA22e of between 19x and 23x', says Oddo.  Nevertheless, this multiple remains high, and can only be justified by growth synergies. We believe that China should be the 1st lever of synergies, given that the Aësop brand has only been present there since 2022, with the opening of a 1st point of sale, and that L'Oréal has a significant level of critical mass in China (c.20% of sales)' adds the analyst.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Therefore, analyst Alberto Gandolfi resumed a ""buy"" rating on the energy group's shares at a price target of 56 euros in a study available on Monday.      Government-subsidized investments in renewables in the U.S. and the EU should boost RWE's sales much more than previously expected, Gandolfi believes. He estimates that RWE's investments will almost double by 2027 compared to current levels and that operating income (Ebitda) from renewables will increase by an average of 17 percent year on year.      Against the backdrop of good return prospects for the years 2024 to 2026, the energy group is likely to raise its long-term earnings targets at the Capital Markets Day in November, the expert expects. He raised his operating profit forecasts for the years 2023 to 2025.      However, Gandolfi cautioned that RWE needs to address the rather diverse cost of capital in its portfolio. He also expects profits to decline until 2026 in the non-regulated area, such as lignite, nuclear power, gas as well as in the trading business.      For shares with a ""Buy"" rating, Goldman Sachs expects a high return potential at the current price level and in comparison with the other companies from the same sector monitored by the bank./edh/ag/mis           Analyzing institute Goldman Sachs.

The market is underestimating the scale of change that investment plans in renewables in the U.S. and Europe are likely to bring, analyst Alberto Gandolfi wrote in a research note issued Monday. Against the backdrop of the good return outlook, the energy group is likely to raise its long-term earnings targets at its capital markets day in November. However, he said RWE needs to address the rather diverse cost of capital in its portfolio. In addition, it expects profits to decline until 2026 in the non-regulated area, such as lignite and nuclear power./tav/la  Publication of the original study: 03.04.2023 / 05:59 / GMT First disclosure of original study: Date not specified in study / Time not specified in study / Time zone not specified in study----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,RWE AG,RWE,DE0007037129,Equities,Multiline Utilities

As a result, analyst Jaime Rowbotham upgraded the shares of Lufthansa, IAG and Air France-KLM each from ""hold"" to ""buy"" and also raised the price targets in an industry report published on Friday.      Although the first quarter of 2023 should still bring losses, the airlines' businesses should recover more quickly than he had previously expected during the rest of the year, Rowbotham said, explaining his reassessment. He said he now sees more than 20 percent more potential for operating profit growth compared with his previous estimates, which is about 18 percent higher than the consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The improved earnings outlook and the resulting reduction in debt could also bring further significant gains for share prices in the coming months.      Among the three sector stocks mentioned, Rowbotham favors Lufthansa. The Frankfurt-based airline's only cautious capacity expansion, which boosts confidence in sustained profitability, and the planned reduction in costs apart from fuel costs, which gives it the greatest scope for profitable growth in the coming year, speak in its favor. Lufthansa also scored points for having the strongest balance sheet, the best free cash flow outlook, the expected resumption of dividend payments, and a favorable valuation by historical standards.      In the case of competitors IAG and Air France-KLM, the analyst positively highlighted their expected declining debt levels. Concerns about the need for further potentially profit-diluting capital increases should therefore increasingly fade and share prices continue to rise.      With a Buy rating, Deutsche Bank recommends buying the stock based on the expected total return for the next twelve months./gl/la/he  Analyzing institute Deutsche Bank      Publication of the original study: 31.03.2023 / time not specified in study / CEST First circulation of the original study: 31.03.2023 / 06:53 / CEST",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Lufthansa,LHA,DE0008232125,Equities,Airlines

According to the analyst, operating sales in 2023 should approach 725 ME, with sales from mature facilities close to 633 ME (+6% / guidance: at least '+6% organic') and sales from ramp-up facilities close to 90 MEe (vs. 78 ME in 2022). The broker adds that 2023 is not likely to be a year of intense external development, as the sector is in a transition phase, and multiples are still considered too high given the sector's specific risk profile. Oddo believes that, while the inflationary environment may make the operator's business less profitable in the short term, ""LNA Santé's business model, governance and quality of care place it among the sustainable players"". What's more, 'LNA Santé's financial situation is healthier than that of Orpéa or even Korian, which have to hold back their Capex to meet banking or financial market requirements', concludes Oddo.

The analyst reports that Tiffany's flagship store on 5th Avenue in New York will open its doors to the public on April 28. LVMH investors have long awaited the reopening of this unique store - named 'The Landmark' - after several years of renovation work, which began in 2019. ""This eventmeans a lot because Tiffany's Fifth Avenue has always been the world's largest luxury store, having generated around $400 million in revenues in 2018,"" Stifel points out.The broker points out that Tiffany posted solid results last year, generating north of €5 billion in sales and nearly €1 billion in EBIT. The brand nevertheless needs to renovate more than 400 stores over the next five years, which requires time and capital to improve their appearance, currently lagging behind competitors such asCartier, which embarked on a global store renovation program in 2015 and is now reaping the benefits of a superior retail concept.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

The securities listed in the index of medium-sized companies MDax fell in the morning on the trading platform Tradegate by just under one percent compared to the previous day's close on Xetra.      This means that the cautious forecast is likely to weigh more heavily on investors for the time being, as the Group did indeed have positive things to report for the past year with a surprisingly significant increase in operating profit. However, the Executive Board expects headwinds in day-to-day business this year as well due to higher energy costs. The operating margin is therefore only likely to reach the level of 2022 in the best case, it said. Baader analyst Peter Rothenaicher was positive and spoke of strong figures for the past year. Although the margin outlook is cautious, he sees good reasons for this. In addition, a further increase in sales is expected./tav/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Jungheinrich AG,JUN3,DE0006219934,Equities,Heavy Machinery & Vehicles

Several analysts have commented on the stock following the positive data on Dupixent.Barclays today upgraded its advice on Sanofi from 'in-line weighted' to 'overweight' following the 'impressive' clinical results unveiled last week for Dupixent in the treatment of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).In a study of the European pharmaceutical sector, the analyst explains that he now expects annual sales of 22 billion euros for Dupixent by 2030, compared with a forecast of 16.5 billion euros to date.In his opinion, this development highlights the value side of Sanofi shares, i.e. their low valuation compared with other stocks such as GSK or Novartis.With investors increasingly concerned about the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) on the sector, we consider Sanofi to be protected in the short term"", adds the intermediary.The legislation introduced in the USA under the IRA provides for a cap on drug prices.Morgan Stanley says it has also raised its target price for the stock from €90 to €115.Jefferies also reaffirms its 'buy' recommendation and 120 euro price target on Sanofi, welcoming the release of positive Phase III data for its flagship drug Dupixent in COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).""Dupixent significantly reduced exacerbations and improved lung function, and could thus be the first biologic drug approved for this important market opportunity if the second trial succeeds in the first half of 2024"", it points out. The broker points out that its sales estimate for Dupixent of €20 billion by 2031 includes only €0.7 billion for COPD, implying upside potential for the healthcare group's long-term EPS in the event of success.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Following a change in the valuation process, the price target was almost halved from 295 to 149 (current price 116.60) euros. In the course of this, the previous buy recommendation was also removed, the new vote is ""Hold"".      Analyst Daniel Schwarz emphasized in his study that the drastic cut was to a lesser extent due to the special dividend of 19 euros per share paid by VW. However, after the IPO of VW's sports car subsidiary Porsche AG was completed, it was also a new realization that the VW Group was not profiting adequately from such valuable investments, he said.       In addition to Porsche AG, he also mentioned the Lamborghini and Bentley brands belonging to VW. A chance for a new and higher valuation of VW shares could indeed involve further sales of Porsche AG shares - but that would have been ruled out by the Wolfsburg-based company.       Against this background, he no longer considers the previous valuation approach based on the sum of the Group's parts to be appropriate. He now bases the value potential of the share on the price/earnings ratio.       Schwarz generally considers European automakers to be attractive. In the German sector environment, however, he advises investors to focus on manufacturers with a clear positioning in the premium segment. His only buy recommendation among German automakers is now Mercedes-Benz. The expert also only rates premium competitors BMW and Porsche AG as ""hold"".      The expert's views also affect the shares of VW's parent company Porsche SE. For these, Schwarz also significantly reduced his price target from 132 to 78 euros. However, he maintained his previous buy recommendation for Porsche SE, as the shares offered a better ratio of opportunities and risks in a VW comparison.      According to the ""Hold"" rating, the analysts at Stifel believe that the share will have a total return (share price development + dividend yield) of between -5 percent and +10 percent over a twelve-month period. With a ""Buy"" rating, Stifel's analysts expect the stock to post an absolute price gain of more than 10 percent on a twelve-month horizon./tih/ag/mis      Analyzing institute Stifel.

   Shares in Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA tumbled on Friday after the retailer was downgraded by Moody's on the back of an increasingly challenging environment for grocers in France. 

  At 0927 GMT, the stock was trading 6.8% lower at EUR6.25. 

  The financial-ratings agency lowered the French company's rating to Caa1 from B3, and said the downgrade takes into account a continued decline in the group's market share in French retailing, as well as both a negative free cash flow and a reduction in retail margins in France last year. 

  Moody's said it expects Casino to struggle maintaining its sales volumes in the current year in an environment marked by high inflation, low consumer confidence and rising costs. Free cash flow in France is expected to remain negative for the next 12 to 18 months, the agency said. 

  ""The downgrade reflects also the weak liquidity profile of the company because the company will have to rely on the proceeds from its ongoing asset disposal plan to repay upcoming debt maturities,"" Moody's said. 

  The agency noted that Casino still has to refinance or repay around 1.2 billion euros ($1.30 billion) of outstanding notes by 2024 and a further EUR1.8 billion of outstanding debt in 2025.

Analyst Constantin Hesse therefore downgraded the stock from ""buy"" to ""hold"" in a report published on Thursday and lowered the price target from 95 to 75 (current price: 65) euros. Siltronic is one of the world's leading producers of silicon wafers on which integrated circuits (microchips) are manufactured.      Although he continues to see only limited downside risks for the Siltronic share, Hesse explained, no significant positive price drivers are to be expected in the coming months. This is because demand in the sales markets is still sluggish, and customers in the memory chips and logic chips semiconductor segments still have increased inventories.      The expert cut his Siltronic earnings (EPS) forecasts for 2023 and 2024 by 25 and 13 percent, respectively, and his sales estimates by 11 and 10 percent, respectively.      However, Hesse remains optimistic for the semiconductor industry equipment supplier in the medium term, especially given the capacity expansion of chip producers and the increasing use of chips in consumer electronics, electric vehicles and industry in general.      In line with the ""Hold"" rating, Jefferies analysts expect the stock to achieve a total return (price gain + dividend) of up to 15% over a twelve-month period, but also a price loss (net of dividend) of up to 10%./edh/tav/stk      Analyzing institute Jefferies.

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CROSSJECT-15844218/news/Crossject-FY22-not-much-to-learn-from-the-release-43320696/,CROSSJECT  :  FY22: not much to learn from the release,"March 23, 2023 at 07:25 am EDT","FY22: not much to learn from the releaseEARNINGS/SALES RELEASESAs usual, the FY results are not meaningful.
The financing is secured for the short term, but this is not new news.
No real news either on the progress made on various fronts (BARDA, EUA, filings).
The market remains hungry for more.
We see room to improve the group’s communication.FACTCrossject FY22 results. Operating income reached €9.718m vs €6.772m, the operating result was €-19.386m vs €-11.823m, and the net result €-17.255m vs €-10.806m. The company “had cash of €8m (€10m a year ago), plus €6.2m in non- dilutive financing and €3.8m from the same plan, yet to be received, of which €2m is conditional on obtaining Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the FDA”.ANALYSISAs always, note that the current numbers are of little relevance since the story of Crossject is based on the future launch of Zeneo combined with the NTEs the group is targeting. In particular, the group’s top-line has little meaning along with the losses posted by the company. Note that this income includes c.€1.8m stemming from the BARDA invoicing. Nonetheless, operating income increased quite substantially (+43% to €9.7m including c. €6.1m in capitalized production). Again, not such an important number in absolute terms, but still positive news (by the way, note that the P&L mentioned in the English version of the release in page 5 is…wrong since the capitalized production is missing). On a less positive front, operating expenses steadily increased to €23m vs €18.6m, an acceleration vs the H122 where they “only” reached €10m. While this is understandable for a company that is still in a ramp-up phase with personnel expenses and purchases/external charges growing by some €4m, this is certainly part of the explanation for the mild market reaction to these numbers, on top of communication that we deem to be “awkward”. 
On the financing front, the company has reached a number of agreements and proceeded with a few capital issuances which have secured the structure of its balance sheet (roughly speaking €11m in capital increase and loans, the latter reaching a total of €14m of which €4m were granted in FY22 – also see our Latest dated 12 January 2023). Thus the available cash at year-end FY22 amounted to €7.8m, broadly stable on a year-on-year basis given the cash-burn. The latter reached €-5.1m in operating terms and €-6.8m in capex, for a total of c.€12m. The company again indicated that it was confident in “its ability to find the necessary financing to continue its development”, taking into account the amount of available cash, the remaining part of the €14m loan from banks and the expected cash-in from the BARDA contract (monthly invoicing). We regret that the management no longer mentions pursuing its strategy of focusing on non-dilutive instruments in its future financing. In fact, they indicate that the use of such instruments its much less likely than before but do not rule them out completely. As far as capex is concerned (roughly €7m for both FY22 and FY21), we see no reason for this figure to increase materially before the first contracts are signed (i.e. after the product filings). As mentioned above, this should also be financed by the growing income from the BARDA agreement (US$1.8m in FY22) with a total of US$35m to come (on a monthly basis) over the next three years. It is worth mentioning that these billings are not evenly split but will grow as time goes by so we don’t expect US$12-15m in FY23. Some more financing will nonetheless come from this source and, although no detail is given, we estimate that the group should be able to cash in at least a good €5m in FY23 (to remain conservative).
At the end of the day, the market reaction (c.-12%) was a mix of several elements in our view. It was not due to the numbers as such, which did not send any particularly negative signals. Still, we believe that investors expected more on the development side. The agreement with the BARDA was good news in FY22, but has been known since…last June. Moreover, nothing has changed (i.e. no additional details given) on the EUA (Emergency Use Utilization) with the first products still expected to be delivered by the year-end. We also found the group’s communication with the financial markets rather awkward, in particular in terms of information distribution and organization, with the analysts’ meeting taking place almost two days after the release. We believe the group also has to work on this, even if the market is primarily expecting progress on the marketing of the group’s products.IMPACTThese numbers will not change our forecasts much. We will fine-tune our model on the basis of the FY22 accounts but, since the group’s valuation is essentially based on its mid to long term prospects, our valuation is unlikely to change significantly.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Crossject,ALCJ,FR0011716265,Equities,"Medical Equipment, Supplies & Distribution"

However, this should not affect the weak share prices too much for the time being, the expert believes.      While most British industry representatives still offered reasonable asset returns and rents with below-average debt, the analyst is currently particularly the continental European landlords headaches. Here Gynsens criticizes too low yields and weak or endangered rents in most cases. Moreover, in too many cases the business is financed with debt.      He therefore remains particularly cautious for the comparatively highly indebted company Aroundtown. Here he continues to advise investors to underweight the share in the portfolio. But also the vote for Europe's largest landlord Vonovia-is now more cautious, here the expert downgraded from ""Equal-weight"" to ""Underweight"" and cut the price target significantly from 30 to 19 euros - but is thus after the weak price reaction again a good one euro above the current price. The Vonovia share had fallen to a new low since 2014 on Wednesday as a result of the study.      Investors are now repositioning themselves and are acting with greater caution with regard to real estate stocks, Gynsens continued. Nevertheless, the expert does not believe that prices in the sector are currently threatened with another major setback, after the valuation had already priced in a low in net asset value last year. However, this could change if companies continue to improve their balance sheets or if the net asset value of their portfolios continues to fall.      Currently, however, the direction of the sector is mainly determined by bond market yields. Rising interest rates had recently made debt financing considerably more expensive for real estate companies, which in turn had already prompted some companies to cut their dividends (Vonovia) or suspend them completely (Grand City Properties, LEG).      While Gynsens approves of waiving dividends in order to strengthen balance sheets, he sees a point of criticism here for Vonovia. In view of the merely reduced payout, he fears that further measures will be necessary at the Bochum-based company to repair its balance sheet in view of the equally high level of debt.      At the same time, the recent banking turmoil is likely to make the situation even more difficult for the industry as a whole, as the yield curve is flattening but this could at the same time weigh on the availability of capital, the expert fears. There is also likely to be stricter scrutiny of banks' asset quality, including property valuation, in the future.      This is precisely where the analyst sees a residual risk in his assessment of future share price scenarios, should the availability of capital possibly prove to be more of a burden on the sector than expected. On the other hand, after an initial sharp price correction, he even sees scope for a general market-driven rally should central banks return to monetary easing.      In general, Gynsens prefers UK real estate stocks to those from continental Europe in these scenarios due to their comparatively better yield profile.      According to the ""Underweight"" rating, Morgan Stanley expects the stock to have a below-average total return compared to other stocks in the same sector monitored by the bank. A period of between twelve and 18 months is used as a basis./tav/ag/mis      Analyzing institution Morgan Stanley.",© dpa-AFX - 2023,TAG Immobilien AG,TEG,DE0008303504,Equities,Real Estate Development & Operations

  LG Energy Solution Ltd.'s shares climbed Wednesday, tracking the overnight rally in U.S. electric-vehicle making giant Tesla Inc. after a credit-rating upgrade. 

  Shares of the South Korean EV battery maker closed 5.0% higher at 573,000 won ($439.47) to notch the sharpest daily percentage gain in almost two months, though paring some gains earlier in the session. The stock outperformed the broader benchmark Kospi's 1.2% gain for the day. 

  The rally in shares of LG Energy Solution, which supplies EV batteries to Tesla, tracked the U.S. auto giant, whose shares surged 7.8% on Nasdaq Tuesday, the sharpest daily percentage gain since Jan. 27, according to FactSet. 

  Tesla advanced after Moody's Investors Service on Monday lifted its long-term issuer rating on Tesla's debt to Baa3. ""The rating action reflects expectation that Tesla will remain one of the foremost manufacturers of battery electric vehicles with an expanding global presence and very high profitability,"" Moody's said in a statement. 

  Moody's said it expects Tesla to deliver about 1.8 million vehicles globally in 2023, up 34% from 2022. 

  Goldman Sachs said in a research note Wednesday that it expects LG Energy Solution and other South Korean battery makers to raise their combined U.S. market share sharply to 57% by 2025, compared with 11% in 2021. It points out that LG Energy Solution's U.S. projects account for 70% of the company's current backlog 

  South Korean companies are rapidly expanding battery-production capacity in the U.S. after years of localizing the supply chain there to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act that supports local manufacturers against Chinese exports, the U.S. investment bank said. 

  Goldman Sachs said it maintains its neutral rating and target price of KRW540,000 for LG Energy Solution.

Moody's revised the outlook on UBS's long-term deposit ratings and senior unsecured ratings to negative from stable, and S&P Global Ratings also cut its outlook to negative. The Moody's rating change was motivated by concern that Credit Suisse's weaker credit profile and the cost of an integration following the takeover would make it more difficult for UBS to hit financial targets, while S&P Global Ratings cited similar reasons for its downgrade. UBS shares rose in early trading on Tuesday following a steep fall after the acquisition was first outlined. Dow Jones & Co. owns Factiva. (cecilia.butini@wsj.com)

Worries about a conflagration persist. In particular, the looming total default of certain billion-dollar bonds of the major Swiss bank weighed heavily in part on the prices of banks and insurers. For this reason, numerous sector stocks in Asia had already come under pressure before. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) said that the European banking sector was resilient.       The index of the European banking sector, the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks, recently lost 2.4 percent, having previously slumped to a low since mid-November with a loss of over 5 percent at times. In the previous week, the sector barometer had already lost 11.5 percent in the wake of the crisis at U.S. regional banks and uncertainty about the future of Credit Suisse.       Still at the end of February, the index had climbed to its highest level since 2018 in the interest rate turnaround. Since the interim high, the minus now adds up to almost a fifth. For the shares of Credit Suisse, the price disaster continued, they slid again by two-thirds to another record low. In the meantime, one share is not even worth one franc. UBS shares recently lost 5 percent after falling 16 percent.      Thus, the rescue of the Swiss bank, which was negotiated in a long marathon of negotiations over the weekend, failed to have its intended signal effect on the market as a reassurance for the financial markets.       Konstantin Oldenburger of broker CMC believes it is only too understandable that investors are in turmoil given the turmoil in the Swiss banking market, which was once thought to be safe. ""Before the weekend, all official bodies were still acting with conviction as if everything was under control,"" he wrote. But now, with UBS's takeover of Credit Suisse and new monetary support measures from the U.S. Federal Reserve, ""events are overlapping to suggest exactly the opposite to investors.""       UBS is taking over its smaller local rival for three billion francs (just over 3 billion euros). In addition, it is liable for losses of up to five billion francs. In addition, there is a government loss guarantee of 9 billion francs and liquidity commitments of up to 200 billion francs. In addition, six major central banks, including the European Central Bank and the U.S. Fed, increased their stroke rate to provide dollar liquidity to the financial system.      Oldenburger's CMC colleague Michael Hewson pointed out that some Credit Suisse bondholders are now facing huge losses. Subordinated bonds, known as AT1 bonds, are defaulting. Deutsche Bank meanwhile stated that it had ""almost zero"" investment in these securities. A price slide of at times almost eleven percent could not be avoided here either, the last time a minus of more than three percent was recorded here. Commerzbank shares lost similarly strongly, but the bank has no investment in AT1 bonds. Allianz shares fell by one percent.      RBC expert Anke Reingen, referring to the takeover, which was apparently also pushed through by politicians and regulators, wrote that while it was ""unlikely that UBS would prefer this path, it seems to have been a necessary step, not only for Swiss banks, but for the entire global banking sector.""       What this means for UBS shares, however, remains controversial among analysts for the time being: to Reingen, for example, the acquisition appears attractive in the longer term. And Bofa analyst Alastair Ryan immediately upgraded UBS; he sees considerable synergy potential and therefore now recommends buying the securities.      France's Societe Generale, on the other hand, removed its buy recommendation, and analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods also downgraded UBS stock from ""market perform"" to ""underperform."" The concerted action takes away the market's concern about contagion effects for the time being, and given the low purchase price, it could turn into a promising deal, argued industry expert Thomas Hallett . For the time being, however, the transaction brings a lot of uncertainty./tav/ag/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Commerzbank AG,CBK,DE000CBK1001,Equities,Banks

On the most important Asian stock exchanges it went on Monday predominantly downward. The German benchmark index Dax also started trading with discounts. In particular, the shares of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank lost significant value.      Both the billion euro deal in Switzerland and the measures taken by several central banks to provide liquidity to the financial system did little to counter fears of a banking crisis. The mood for banks remains depressed, investors continued to withdraw. The euro initially hardly reacted on Monday morning. Gold, on the other hand, rose significantly: The continuing uncertainty in the financial markets drove the gold price on Monday for the first time in a long time above the mark of 2000 U.S. dollars.      For banks and insurers, after the ""emergency rescue"" of Credit Suisse, another troubled day with price losses loomed. Credit Suisse shares themselves slumped more than 60 percent to 0.697 francs in pre-market trading in Switzerland. UBS shares lost about 14 percent. Deutsche Bank shares fell by more than nine percent and Commerzbank shares by more than seven percent.      Uncertainty was caused by the fact that holders of Credit Suisse's quasi-equity bonds are to lose all their invested money in the course of the takeover. This involves so-called AT1 bonds in the amount of 16 billion Swiss francs (16.2 billion euros), as Credit Suisse and the financial regulator Finma had announced on Sunday.       Deutsche Bank, however, sees itself hardly affected by this. The Dax group has ""almost zero"" exposure to these Credit Suisse bonds, a spokesman said Monday. Commerzbank has no money at all invested in its Swiss rival's AT1 bonds, according to a spokesman.      UBS is taking over its smaller local rival for three billion francs (just over 3 billion euros). In addition, it is liable for losses of up to five billion francs. In addition, there is a state loss guarantee of 9 billion francs and liquidity commitments of up to 200 billion francs.      The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is supporting the transaction with liquidity assistance and is granting the banks a loan of up to 100 billion francs. In addition, the SNB could grant Credit Suisse a liquidity support loan of up to 100 billion francs secured by a default guarantee from the Swiss government. The Swiss government secured a guarantee of 9 billion francs for UBS. Other central banks welcomed the measures.      A takeover of Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-largest bank, by the larger UBS is the most significant bank merger in Europe since the financial crisis 15 years ago. It spells the end for 167-year-old Credit Suisse, whose headquarters are across the street from rival UBS on Zurich's Paradeplatz. The deal was preceded by marathon negotiations involving the two banks and top political and regulatory officials. The government and regulators were concerned with preventing a conflagration.      The Swiss government in Bern was under considerable pressure to stabilize the situation and prop up Credit Suisse. After all, Credit Suisse is one of the world's largest asset managers and is one of the 30 global systemically important banks whose failure would shake the international financial system.      Swiss President Alain Berset said ""the Federal Council is convinced that the takeover is the best solution to restore confidence."" Credit Suisse had lost customer confidence, liquidity had to be guaranteed. The transaction was important for the stability of the Swiss financial center, it added. SNB President Thomas Jordan stressed that reputation is central to Switzerland's economy.      Finance Minister Karin Keller-Suter said the federal government gave the CHF 9 billion guarantee to cushion Credit Suisse's risks. ""Taxpayers have little risk"" - any other scenario would have cost more. He said one has a private partner and a solid bank taking over Credit Suisse. It was not a government bailout, the minister stressed. The federal government had merely provided a guarantee.      UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher spoke of a huge opportunity for UBS. The combination of the two banks strengthens its position, he said. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma) welcomed the takeover solution and the measures taken by the federal government and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Credit Suisse had been at risk of insolvency, even though the bank remained solvent, it added.      Credit Suisse had recently suffered from a significant loss of investor confidence. Its share price had fallen to a record low after the bank's largest investor ruled out providing further capital and the institution continued to struggle with cash outflows.      The merger to create a new industry giant is expected to create a financial institution with more than $5 trillion in assets under management, according to UBS. No statements could be made about possible job cuts, it said Sunday evening. Together, the two institutions employ about 120,000 people.      UBS, with more than 72,000 employees, had total assets equivalent to 1,030 billion euros in 2022, while Credit Suisse, with just over 50,000 employees, had total assets equivalent to 535.44 billion euros. UBS had made a profit of $7.6 billion (currently 7.07 billion euros) in 2022. Credit Suisse, on the other hand, reported a loss of 7.3 billion francs (7.4 billion euros)./mrd/oe/stw/DP/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Commerzbank AG,CBK,DE000CBK1001,Equities,Banks

The research firm reports that the sale of all Icade's healthcare assets will take place in 3 phases, spread over the period up to 2025.  Given the strong demand for healthcare assets and the benchmark set by phase 1, we model a discount of -5% on asset valuations for phases 2 and 3. The main buyer, Primonial, is not legally obliged to acquire the assets in phases 2 and 3, which could potentially complicate transactions"", the analyst points out. However, Invesr remains confident in the successful completion of the 3 phases, which will generate excessive cash flow (E3 billion) for a wide range of potential uses.  The operation is positive in the short term, with the prospect of cumulative dividends from 2023 to 2025 of almost 44% of the current share price, but in the medium term it will leave Icade at the head of a less diversified and clearly less attractive portfolio, with a sharply reduced normative dividend (-18%)"", concludes the analyst.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

In our view higher rates, which have resulted in half-mast transaction volumes for the retail brokerage platforms, will continue to generate high interest income for the firm as they continue to rise but also more customers join the platform. 
As stressed by the management, the good news is that platform customers are not using Swissquote as a regular bank from which they would expect to receive interest income. Instead they use it as a portfolio management tool. The share of cash deposits as a percentage of customer assets has increased from 15% to 18% yoy, and this is not only due to lower Assets Under Custody. Although this represents a modest increase in CHF-amount (from an average cash deposit per customer CHF 17.2k to CHF 17.4k), the continued growth in customers will continue to feed this pool of cash as well as transaction volumes. 
In fact, the firm has recorded 10.5% growth in accounts yoy and, as we have said in the past, we believe that the past 12 months growth in customer accounts offers substantial potential for further volumes given that:
1. New customers should progressively add funds as they become familiar with the tool 
2. Customers that have joined within this window have faced tumultuous markets, massively impeding trading massivelyIMPACTWe are confident that Swissquote will meet its objectives. On top of a sustained growth, the firm has an extremely discipled cost management policy. 
The DPS of CHF 2.2 (in line with our expectations), similar to the 2021 level, is a material sign of resilience given the variation of the firm’s profitability year on year. 
We also like the fact that the firm has some cash at hand to finance new projects. 
Our investment thesis is confirmed and our model update will not lead to a change in recommendation.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Swissquote Group Holding Ltd,SQN,CH0010675863,Equities,Financial & Commodity Market Operators

The Eon share price has recovered by almost half from its low of 7.28 euros in November, and since the beginning of the year the shares are the seventh strongest among the 40 Dax stocks.      Analyst Peter Bisztyga from Bank of America justified the buy recommendation with structural growth drivers as a result of the fundamental restructuring of the energy industry.

According to a study on Tuesday, analyst Adrian Pehl sees the price target at 56 euros, which currently means an upside potential of almost 16 percent.      With a view to the prices for biodiesel and bioethanol, the share price has now priced in a lot of negativity. In addition, the environment for ""second-generation biofuels"" is promising, as is international expansion. On the way to a carbon-neutral future, shares like Verbio are in principle a kind of piece of the puzzle.      With the results of the second fiscal quarter of 2022/23, the bottom should probably have been reached in the short term, so that the coming quarters should be better and the targets for the fiscal year should be achieved, Pehl wrote. ""From the coming fiscal year on, Verbio should then reduce what we call the 'methane mountain'. This should significantly support positive earnings momentum, at least for 2023/24.""      However, as nothing concrete has been said by the company so far beyond fiscal 2024/25 and in relation to the U.S., the market may want to wait for better forecasts to assess Verbio's longer-term potential.      According to the ""Buy"" rating, the analysts at Stifel believe that the stock should yield a total return (share price performance + dividend yield) of more than 10 percent over a twelve-month period./ck/bek/tih  Analyzing institute Stifel.

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CHARGEURS-5218/news/Chargeurs-Strong-2022-introduces-a-promising-2023-43227480/,CHARGEURS  :  Strong 2022 introduces a promising 2023,"March 13, 2023 at 02:46 am EDT","Strong 2022 introduces a promising 2023EARNINGS/SALES RELEASESAfter a record year in 2021 and despite a tough macro-economic environment, Chargeurs closed FY22 on a high note. Chargeurs’ resilient performance was driven by the impressive performance of the PCC Fashion Technologies division and a fast-growing Luxury segment. While a slowdown has been seen in the CAM business, there is little to worry about in view of the signs of a rebound currently observed. The solid results, combined with the anticipated normalisation, have prompted Chargeurs to reaffirm its 2025 targets.FACT
Chargeurs posted revenues of €746.4m in 2022, up a slight +1.3% yoy but +15.3% excluding the health operations (CHS), driven by strong growth at Fashion Technologies (CFT) and Museum Studio (CMS).
Over 2022, CFT reached €220m in revenues, or +32.4% lfl, and its EBITDA increased by 98.4% to €24.2m, bringing the margin up to 11%, driven by a positive volume and price effect along with the rebound of the fashion sector.
Chargeurs Museum Studio (CMS) reported a 75.1% increase in revenue to €87.2m, driven by organic growth of 34.5% and a 32.3% consolidation effect. EBITDA and ROPA increased by 15.3% and 10.6%, respectively.
Chargeurs Advanced Materials (CAM), on the other hand, posted revenues down 6.3% lfl and EBITDA down 13% due to the normalisation of its clients’ inventories. 
While Chargeurs’ EBITDA came in at €67.9m, down 8% yoy, the figure is still 5.9% above our expectations and up 22.5% excluding CHS. 
Chargeurs’ reported ROPA was a clear beat, outperforming our expectations by 11.3% to €45.4m. 
Despite the good operating results, the unfavourable development of working capital compared with the particularly good year of 2021 led to a deterioration in CFO and therefore in the net debt position, which reached €174.7m versus €109.3m last year. ANALYSISChargeurs demonstrated the resilience of its asynchronous business model in 2022, with revenue rising slightly by 1.3% lfl and by 8.7% lfl excluding the healthcare activity to €746.4m. The inflationary context did not dent the group’s performances, which recorded a 4.7% increase in its gross margin to €195m. The group’s pricing power and the diversity of its activities in terms of both sector and geographically, combined with its leading position in niche segments, enabled Chargeurs to post a ROPA of €45.4m, 11.3% above our expectations. 
A resilient performance boosted by CFT PCC
In 2022, the Advanced Materials division posted a 6.3% organic decline in sales to €332.6m. This decline should be put into perspective as 2021 was an exceptional year due to a high level of inventory of its clients keen to manage potential supply-chain disruptions. The fall in volumes in H2 22 is therefore explained by the normalisation of inventories and the ongoing destocking by customers in the context of global economic uncertainties. In 2022, CAM reported a 12.8% decline in EBITDA to €32m, representing a 120bp drop in the margin. Nevertheless, Chargeurs remains confident about the future of the surface solutions business, which is beginning to benefit from the global turnaround. Chargeurs expects a rebound under the cover of public investment programmes, an improvement in the health situation in China, and the easing of energy price pressures. As such, the business is currently witnessing the early signs of a rebound as reflected by the uptick in order intake observed in January-February, particularly in Europe. If this trend is confirmed in the coming months, it will result in an improvement in sales in H2 
CFT proved to be the primary driver of Chargeurs’ performance in 2022, with revenue up 32.4% organically, EBITDA margin up 360bp to 11% and ROPA up 254.2% to €17m. The business’s excellent performance was driven by a combination of volume effects buoyed up by the rebound in the fashion market, clear market share gains and a favourable price effect. Although the 2022 delivery sets new levels for CFT, Chargeurs remains confident of the division’s ability to yield even more, due to a high order book. 
Unsurprisingly, the health segment posted sharply lower figures compared with 2021 due to the normalisation of the sanitary situation. In 2022, the division reported revenues down 93.2% to €6.4m, EBITDA down 77% to €5.2m and ROPA down 80.2% to €4.3m. The activity will now be consolidated under the CFT PCC division.
A vibrant and expanding luxury business
The year 2022 was a pivotal one for Chargeurs Museum Studio, which recorded a 75.1% increase in revenues to €87.2m, driven by a 32.3% scope effect linked to the acquisitions of Event Communications and Skira Editore, and a 34.5% organic growth rate. EBITDA and ROPA also recorded positive dynamics with, respectively, +15.3% and +10.6%. The outlook for the coming years is very positive with an order book that should enable the business line to exceed €120m in revenues by 2023. Around 50% of the business performance will be driven by the American market going forward.
Chargeurs Luxury Fibers (premium wool)  also had an excellent year with organic revenue growth of 7.9% to €94.7m. This segment is not meant to generate high margins but it managed to double its net earnings to €2m. These good figures were driven by a positive price mix effect and by the NATIVA brand expansion, as illustrated by  a global contract signed with Gucci. 
Lastly, the Personal Goods subdivision was created to consolidate Fournival Altesse and The Cambridge Satchel in the Chargeurs’ accounts for the first time, two acquisitions that were completed in 2021 and August 2022, respectively.
The only blemish on the picture is the increase in net debt
In terms of cash flow generation, despite the good performance of the businesses, with EBITDA rising to €67.9m, Chargeurs reported a decline in cash flow to €32.9m. This decline, combined with a €40.5m increase in working capital mainly due to temporary impacts at CAM, and owing to an exceptionally low level in 2021 of 3.8% of sales, led to a deterioration in CFO to €-7.4m from €64.9m in 2021. Chargeurs expects this situation to be resolved through global logistics optimisation plans and a rebound in business. 
As a result, net debt has increased to €174.7m, from €109.3m in 2021, bringing the net debt /EBITDA ratio up to 2.6x from 1.5x in 2021. Even if debt is under control, an expected acquisition in the luxury sector could deteriorate its gearing further, but we note Chargeurs’ 2022 gearing of 0.6x leaves some important headroom compared to its bank covenant of 1.2x.
A solid outlook for 2023
Given the resilience of its results in a challenging environment, Chargeurs is confident about the years ahead. In 2023, the group plans to make a major acquisition to balance the revenue contributions from its Luxury Goods and Technology businesses by growing the former. The group has confirmed its objective of reaching revenues of €1bn and an EBITDA of €100m excluding acquisitions by 2025. Chargeurs expects a more favourable 2023 under the guise of a reduction in the energy crisis and an improvement in the health situation in Asia.
All in all, a year that confirmed the strength of Chargeurs’ business model in a challenging macro-economic environment.IMPACTWe will be raising our FY23 estimates, particularly for CFT and CMS, following this strong release.

In the short term, however, analyst Ben Uglow is cautious in view of the significantly diverged development of prices and volumes and lowered his rating from ""Overweight"" to ""Equal-weight"".      In the study published on Friday, he raised the price target from 31 to 38 euros in view of an expected short-term margin recovery and lower balance sheet risks. He thus still sees a price potential of 13 percent.      Predictability of order development is made more difficult by the significantly diverging price and volume development in 2022, Uglow wrote. For example, he said, order volumes for ITS (Industrial Trucks & Services) slumped in the final quarter, but this was masked by the pricing in the orders. That's because prices were nearly 50 percent above 2019 levels, he said.      Looking at order momentum, which he said plays an important role in the overall capital goods sector, the expert believes volumes could stabilize. Pricing, meanwhile, is much more difficult to determine, he says.      Uglow expects to see falling prices, or price deflation, over the course of the year. ""It could well be moderate,"" he wrote. Still, he questions management's thesis that declines in ITS orders will be limited to a ""high single-digit percentage."" ""There are credible scenarios in which ITS orders decline to about 1.5 to 1.6 billion euros per quarter."" That could equate to a year-over-year decline of more than 25 percent. His baseline scenario is a 12 percent year-over-year decline in orders.      In Kion's SCS (supply chain solutions) business, he also believes a sales recovery by 2024 is questionable.      According to the Equal-Weight rating, Morgan Stanley expects the stock to have an average total return compared to other stocks in the same industry tracked by the bank. A period of between twelve and 18 months is used as a basis./ck/lew/jha/  Analyzing institute Morgan Stanley.

According to the analyst, the stock's valuation is fair and reflects the risks weighing on growth. In Oddo's view, supply chain issues - which management expects to persist throughout the year - and recruitment issues (although the company is optimistic about its ability to hire 12,000 people), as well as the macro environment, will limit growth potential in 2023. The broker nevertheless expects organic growth of 6.9% in 2023, at the upper end of the guidance range (4% to 7%), driven by the recovery in the avionics and space sectors. Against this backdrop, Oddo has marginally raised its estimates (+0.6%/0.4%/0.4% respectively for EPS 2023/24/25), mainly to reflect the impact of improved FCF generation and the recovery in interest rates on financial income.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Oddo reports that organic sales growth should be between 11% and 13%, which is slightly higher than the Group's previous guidance (>10%). The analyst therefore specifies that his 2023 EPS estimates should be raised by 3%. ""The organic growth expected in 2023 is very satisfactory, and the improvement in profitability and FCF generation testify to the resilience of Elis' business model"", concludes Oddo.

Oddo reports that organic sales growth should be between 11% and 13%, which is slightly higher than the Group's previous guidance (>10%). The analyst therefore specifies that his 2023 EPS estimates should be raised by 3%. ""The organic growth expected in 2023 is very satisfactory, and the improvement in profitability and FCF generation testify to the resilience of Elis' business model"", concludes Oddo.

' Visibility is therefore particularly good with an order backlog of 41 billion euros, equivalent to around 28 months of sales.''

  Nissan Motor Co.'s credit rating was cut to junk status by S&P Global Ratings, which cited a challenging business environment and the Japanese auto maker's relatively weak profitability. 

  S&P on Tuesday lowered its long-term issuer credit ratings on Nissan by one notch to BB+ from BBB-, placing it below investment grade. 

  The rating company said the business environment for the auto industry would likely remain difficult over the next one to two years due partly to supply-chain disruptions and a global economic slowdown. 

  S&P also said that Nissan's profit margin and sales volume, which had been weak over the past couple of years, were unlikely to swiftly improve to the levels that the rating company had previously assumed. 

  The rating company said it remains uncertain on whether Nissan will be able to secure a foothold in the rapidly growing global electric-vehicle market. 

  The rating outlook is stable, S&P said, adding that the company's earnings would likely continue to improve at a moderate pace.

In our view, however the market has yet to really price in the full potential of its platform. 2022 was a tough year for financial markets (and alternative asset classes like cryptos) but, despite this, Swissquote demonstrated its resilience and ability to dodge market turbulence. In our view the firm is a ticking bomb of hidden value waiting to be triggered by better market sentiment. FACTApart from its retail brokerage business, Swissquote has numerous assets that need to be considered in valuation. 
The valuation paradigm needs to look beyond this core business and consider the following: Swissquote without the crypto business is not fully priced into the current market capitalization
The firm has built a crypto exchange which has immense potential value
Swissquote is building a platform at the crossroads of the likes of Moneyfarm, Revolut, Avanza 
The firm captures the higher interest rate environment, naturally hedging the financial market exposureANALYSISSwissquote with and without cryptocurrencies
Swissquote has a great asset compared with many online retail brokers; it offers cryptocurrency trading. While this may not be the most powerful argument these days, one should not forget that markets are fickle and this may turn out to be a major plus were the hype to return. 
Nevertheless, given the uncertainty concerning the future of this asset class, it is worth looking at Swissquote’s underlying value were cryptocurrencies to disappear. 
As we are attempting to solve an equation with unknown multiples, a key parameter in our reasoning comes from the firm’s highly disciplined cost base management. 
Let’s start with staff costs, from which we exclude variable compensation in that the latter contributes noise which is unhelpful in terms of ringfencing the ongoing payroll expenses. Cross-checking with recruitment enables us to identify the recruitment effort and the amount of the CHF impact on the firm’s budget. 
There were major recruitment drives in 2018, 2020 and 2021. In 2019 the firm’s payroll costs peaked as a percentage of net revenues, excluding Crypto and Interest Income-related revenues. This is consistent with the firm’s discipline and ability to predict the revenues that it will generate, and to adapt recruitment accordingly. (We exclude crypto-related revenue in order to isolate the cost impact of recruitment on the “regular” business margin and interest income-related revenue as we believe it is independent of the workforce). 
To derive crypto-related payroll costs, we have assumed that a company like Swissquote grows its staff cost base by between 10% and 15% a year (recruitment plus salary increases). However, since the past 3 to 4 years have seen the rise of online retail brokerage platforms (due to increased interest in financial markets, COVID-19, willingness to invest in a supplementary pension, etc.) and this trend looks set to continue, we take the view that the firm has leveraged this massive increase in commission-based revenue to also increase its recruitment effort for the “regular business”. 
Hence, our scenario takes in a growth assumption of 20%, and identifies any costs above this as having been incurred to develop the crypto-related activities.
Running this scenario from H2 19 to H1 21 (the period during which crypto products were launched and deployed) points to c.CHF10.2m of staff costs, excluding variable compensation, to run the crypto product. There will have been other expenses before and after this window hence we would assume c.10% more costs leading to c.CHF11.2m in FY 21 (which represents c.10.8% of total payroll costs without variable compensation). Assuming that these employees earn c.15% more than the “historical” workforce (scarce engineers and developers with rare backgrounds), this would imply c.63 people at Swissquote working on crypto-related matters (c.6.7% of the average number of employees in FY 21).
Looking at operating expenses excluding Depreciation & Amortisation and Staff costs, we can see the same discipline across the board. 
The operating expenses line includes marketing expenses and provisions. For marketing expenses, in our view it doesn’t make sense to differentiate a marginality given that the firm’s marketing expenses mostly promote Swissquote as a whole rather a given product area. Moreover, we can see from the trend in marketing expenses that, again, the firm has a very disciplined spending policy with flexibility depending on whether nor not any one year is lucrative.
However, we can see that other operating expenses increased during the peak crypto period (2020 and 2021). It is hard to tell whether these incremental expenses are fully dedicated to products or simply the overall business growth (in 2020, net fee & commission income rose by 68% yoy) however, given the sustained expenses in 2021 while Net fee & commission revenue grew by “only” 10% (and crypto by 537%), and in line with our previous comment on staff costs (the firm having used the huge increase in volume to fund additional expenses for the “regular” business) we would assume that, in 2021, there were CHF3-4m of expenses generated from cryptos, although this spending remained mostly variable. 
Adding up the numbers, we derive a kind of EBITDA, in which we divide the marketing expenses & provisions by 5 (number of revenue lines of Swissquote) and further divide this number by 2 assuming that these expenses are for the overall business. For H1 22, we assume staff costs growing by 5% yoy (mostly driven by wage inflation) and other operating expenses and marketing & provisions divided by 3, given the expected lower effort on advertising cryptos. 
Our assumptions for FY 23 include staff costs increasing by 4% yoy due to inflation and people rotation (we can see that, since FY 21, the average wage per employee, calculated using the average number of employees throughout the year, is trending downwards, assuming a cheaper people rotation considering the increased recruitment efforts), then further cut the other operating expenses and marketing expenses vs. FY 22. 
Our assumptions suggest that cryptos were highly accretive for the EBITDA margin in 2021 and very slightly accretive in the H1 22. However, we expect the crypto business to be barely profitable in FY 23. 
Excluding cryptos, any incremental profitability for Swissquote is more than offset by higher interest income, despite conservative assumptions for commission income in FY 23. 
Applying a conservative 23e EV/EBITDA multiple of 11x to Swissquote’s business excluding crypto, we derive a CHF3.05bn valuation (above the firm’s current market cap). Applying a multiple of 3x EV/EBITDA to the crypto business for the average FY 23-25 EBITDA (a lower multiple as we believe the firm would be able to cut fixed costs if the activity remains unprofitable), we derive a negative CHF9m. Deducting the Net Debt – or rather an expected net cash position of CHF 464m for FY 23 – Swissquote would be worth c.CHF3.5bn based on a SOTP methodology.
Swissquote’s rejected asset
The crypto asset class is not what investors want to hear about these days given the recent scandals but, in our view, it would be unwise to wave cryptos goodbye. While, as we have seen, were cryptos to disappear, the downside for Swissquote remains limited, the upside opportunity is immense. 
Should the hype return, Swissquote has built an immensely scarce asset: a crypto exchange.
Swissquote has hitherto been using the Bitstamp and Coinbase exchanges as liquidity providers for crypto trading as well as custodian services. This means that, for any order sent by a Swissquote user to buy BTC or ETH (among others) on the platform, the order would be re-directed to the Bitstamp or Coinbase exchanges. This has meant potential friction, reliance on external providers (potentially decreasing stability) for execution and liquidity, and dependent upon their regular maintenance. 
This has also meant commission for trades (0.5% to 1%).
With its own exchange, which at first will be rolled-out to Bancor (BTN) and progressively to all 36 tokens available on the Swissquote platform, the product should considerably improve. 
Summed up another way: getting rid of an exchange and becoming this exchange is crazy. IMPACTBusiness model developments: what others look like
The market has had difficulty in valuing Swissquote which claims to be different from a classical online retail broker while not being another neobank. 
As the business develops and market participants emerge, Swissquote’s value and uniqueness become clearer as it seems to aggregate parts of many highly-regarded firms of which two are rarely mentioned: Revolut and Moneyfarm.
Swissquote’s underlying value thus remains immense when looking at the peer valuations for similar services. Add to this the fact that Swissquote aggregates all these services on its own platform and the shares definitely deserve a premium given the trend towards super-apps and the powerhouse they represent. 
We’ll be watching for further developments, but our money would be on Swissquote not stopping here. If it manages to record regular inflows/outflows on the back of its payment cards, pushing users to think of their trading account as a kind of regular account with the flexibility to bring-in/withdraw funds, these flows could become very valuable, and trigger a new perception of investing and consuming. 
Accumulated dry power to be lit in a few months
Swissquote has built an extremely well-balanced business. What it has lost in the financial markets (and cryptos) in recent months has been fully offset by the higher interest rate environment. A natural hedge that deserves a premium. 
Swissquote continues to accumulate users on its platform and we believe that this huge growth in accounts (18.9% in 2021 and 13.5% in H1 2022) is going to feed additional “new monies” as users progressively gain trust and adoption of the app increases.

Certainty is returning and the airline's paper is attractively valued, analyst Achal Kumar wrote in a research note issued Monday. He raised the rating from ""hold"" to ""buy"" and increased the price target from 9.00 to 13.60 euros. He thus still sees a price potential of 25 percent.      Kumar not only praised the company's recently presented 2022 figures, but also targeted the outlook for the current year. He said this is particularly positive for the passenger segment, as demand is much stronger than expected. This, he said, could more than make up for weakness in the cargo sector. ""And with some recovery in the overall economic environment next year, the cargo business should then also gradually improve.""      In addition, Kumar pointed out that Lufthansa expects a significantly positive free cash flow (FCF) for the current year, even if it will not be as high as last year. The FCF should be supported by sales and leaseback actions, aircraft sales and positive working capital, so that net debt should decrease in 2023 compared to the previous year. Furthermore, as operating profit (Ebitda) is expected to increase significantly, net debt should continue to decrease compared to Ebitda and could also allow for possible acquisitions.

The research firm reports that price rises, while volumes were maintained, offset cost inflation in H1 in Europe. Nevertheless, BFA's sales fell by 9.2%, with a marked 13.5% decline in Bowls in a shrinking market. The Group points to a shift in consumption towards kit salads in the current inflationary context"", reports the broker. In this context, the group hopes to see BFA return to breakeven in 24/30 months. Deeming this publication ""encouraging"", Oddo marginally revises its sales forecasts and raises its ROC forecasts for 2022/23 and 2023/24 by 7.5% and 11.5% respectively.  We are targeting a margin of 2.6% (+20 bp) in 2022/23, slightly above our guidance, which we consider somewhat cautious. On the other hand, EBIT is adjusted by -38% after including an exceptional charge of ME7, higher financial expenses and a higher corporate tax rate', concludes the analyst.

A potential recession would be a negative, meanwhile supply shortages have led to some pent-up demand, but more expensive credit financing is likely to weigh on demand. In addition, while pricing is currently good for automakers, that too could change again as supply increases, he said.

Against this backdrop, net income (Group share) came to e20m (-16.6%), including a sharp rise in the tax rate and financial income (due to higher interest rates and a e4.5m foreign exchange loss), as well as MEE (including 35% of BALL's income).

The analyst highlights the company's 2022 results, which are ""very good despite China"", with 2022 sales of €1,206 million, up 13.1% organically (oddo expected 13.5%, consensus 11.4%).Adjusted EBIT came in at €111 million, slightly ahead of expectations (ODDO BHF 100 million CSS at €106 million), i.e. a margin in line with 2021 at 9.2%.  For 2023, the Group forecasts mid-to high-single digit growth and an increase in adjusted EBIT margin"", reports Oddo. Oddo also reports on the sale process of the 37% stake by GLAS (the trustee holding 29% of the capital) and AlixPartners (the advisor managing the 8% pledged but not recovered by GLAS so as not to have to launch a takeover bid).  A press release states that the transaction is at a preliminary stage and may not be completed,"" reports the broker.Indeed, while a leading investment bank has been mandated to find a buyer, questions surround the 16% stake held by Dynamic Treasure Group, currently frozen by court order. The situation could therefore remain frozen ""as we do not believe that any player would risk launching a takeover bid without being certain of being able, even theoretically, to reach a squeeze-out, i.e. 90% of the capital"", analyzes Oddo. Nevertheless, 'the fact that the process has been launched may indicate that creditors have information on the evolution of the 16% situation, whereas we have no new information on the subject', concludes the analyst.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

The research firm highlights the difficulty of analyzing underlying business trends due to very different base effects between Q3 and Q4, and in the absence of quarterly organic growth details for TFCo and Evidian. Moreover, 'Evidian posted an Op. Margin of just 5.2%, down 160 bp, whereas we were expecting stability. The road to the 10% medium-term margin now seems a long one...', notes the broker.Oddo reports that Atos has communicated an org. growth target of -1% to +1% (with org. growth >+2% for Evidian and +1% for Evidian). >+2% for Evidian and a slight decline for TFCo) and an Op. Margin target (4% to 5%). However, Atos regrets the lack of visibility on FCF, as it has not given any guidance on this subject.  The stock has rebounded strongly recently, buoyed by the market (the IT Services sector has rebounded overall) and by discussions with Airbus. Expectations regarding Airbus seem high to us, and the stock's valuation seems expensive in relation to the risk associated with the transformation program"", concludes Oddo.
