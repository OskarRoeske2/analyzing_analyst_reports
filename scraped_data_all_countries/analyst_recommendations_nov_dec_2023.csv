Yesterday, Virbac said it was raising its 2023 targets in light of the rebound seen in Q4: the group is now targeting growth at ptc. of around 4% (vs. +2% to +4% previously). It is also targeting growth of +4% to +6% lfl for 2024.'We believe that the 2024 guidance leaves room for an increase, during 2024, including with the non-recurrence of the impact of the 2023 cyberattack. Virbac provides an additional element of visibility by indicating that, by 2030, it is maintaining its current MOP target at 20%', reports the broker. Oddo BHF points out that the update of its model (including the factorization of the 20230 guidance) leads to an increase in its EPS forecasts of around 15% for 2023 and 10% in 2024.

ACTIONOn Friday, Chargeurs announced a takeover bid for itself. Columbus Holding, controlled by Michaël Fribourg, Chairman and CEO of Chargeurs, which currently holds 30% of Chargeurs’ voting rights, is to launch a takeover bid to garner more than 50% of Chargeurs while retaining a listing. With an offer at a 50.5% premium compared to the last three months, Chargeurs sends a signal to the market about its value.FACT
The companies Colombus Holding and (newly formed) Colombus Holding 2, controlled by Michaël Fribourg, Chairman and CEO of Chargeurs, will launch a takeover bid for the shares of Chargeurs without looking for a delisting.
To date, Colombus holds 26.5% of Chargeurs and 29.5% of Chargeurs’ voting rights. 
The offer price of €12 per share represented a premium of 36.22% over last month’s average share price and 50.5% over the last three months.
The Board of Directors has welcomed this transaction, which remains subject to the opinion of the employee representative bodies and the independent expert’s report.ANALYSISColombus with currently close to 30% of the voting rights in Chargeurs (26.5% stake) announced on Friday, 15-12-2023, its intention to launch a bid to garner more than 50% (50% + 1 share at least) of Chargeurs. Yet, it intends to retain a listing “with a significant level of free float to ensure solid liquidity of the shares”. The planned offer at €12 is at a 36% premium to the last month’s average and corresponds to a 50.5% premium to the last three months’ average. Colombus is ultimately controlled by Chargeurs’s Chair and CEO with the support of the Dassault family office. For the purpose of this deal, a Colombus 2 is being set up, bringing together in capital alongside the Fribourg family the historic partners, i.e. the Habert-Dassault family and BNP Paribas Development, as well as new partners including MACSF and CARAC. If the transaction does not result in the acquisition of more than 50% of the capital or voting rights, the offer will lapse.
Michaël Fribourg explained that the market environment for small and mid-cap stocks is difficult with the high volatility. This is an environment that he believes is adding unwarranted strong downward pressure on Chargeurs’ share price, making it difficult to develop a long-term strategy. In fact, Chargeurs sees 2024 as a transitional year, with a new strategic plan not due to be launched until 2025, with genuine changes expected in 2030-35. A structuring M&A operation in the near future is therefore no longer topical. All the above considerations explain Michaël Fribourg’s determination to strengthen his grip on the stock. With a clear majority control, Michaël Fribourg would be able to fully implement his vision and, who knows, perhaps execute a complete turnaround away from its existing assets from 2025 onwards. The strategic review is unlikely to be released before late 2024 and for now the addition of luxury assets as part of a business reshuffling is dropped. 
All in all, if it is true that Chargeurs is showing resilience in a difficult environment, the rebound of its businesses is set to take time. In this sense, we see the tender offer as a liquidity opportunity for minority shareholders. In addition, the operation sends a signal to the market: Chargeurs believes in its stock and considers the market’s sanctions too severe.IMPACTThis news has no impact on our estimates, although we expect modest growth and a rebound, with 2025 sales below Chargeurs’ €1bn target.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Chargeurs,CRI,FR0000130692,Equities,Consumer Goods Conglomerates

They have terminated the agreement with Farfetch for the sale of Yoox Net-A-Porter (YNAP), its loss-making online fashion sales subsidiary.Oddo BHF believes that this announcement no longer comes as much of a surprise, given Farfetch's increasingly precarious position and Richemont's most recent comments.  The cancellation of the agreement has three main consequences: 1) the Farfetch convertible bonds held by Richemont will not be redeemed; they had a nominal value of $300 million and a book value of €218 million. This should have an impact on the group's income statement in the March 2025 financial year, but it is a rather small one-off item in the context of the group's size 2) Richemont must now consider new options for YNAP: we believe it is working to find new partners 3) Richemont must also find alternative technological solutions to power its Houses' e-commerce operations in order to accelerate their growth; we don't think this will prove to be a major problem ' says Oddo BHF.Oddo BHF confirms its Outperform recommendation on the stock, with an unchanged target price of 130 Swiss francs. ' Thanks to Maisons de joaillerie, Richemont offers an above-average risk/return profile in the luxury sector.

Against this backdrop, the share price climbed some 21% last Friday. The trend is quite different today, with the share price dropping 12%, the biggest decline on the SBF120. The broker also urges caution with regard to the Airbus rumor: despite the recent changes to the board and the entry of onepoint into the capital, ""it remains clear that the widely favored scenario [is] that of a sale of TFCo and a capital increase that would largely preserve the integrity of the group's perimeter"".

The electrolysis specialist's first annual report after the IPO did not bring any major surprises, analyst Michael Kuhn wrote in an initial reaction on Monday. The final quarterly figures showed a project-related decline in sales compared to the third quarter, whereas profitability had increased. However, investors are likely to be more interested in the outlook for the new financial year. Thyssenkrupp Nucera is planning significant sales growth in the mid double-digit percentage range, which is in line with expectations. However, the expected operating loss (EBIT) is significantly higher, which is not such a big deal - in the past quarter, a profit was achieved after all instead of the announced loss./gl/tih      Publication of the original study: 18.12.2023 / time not specified in study / GMT First publication of the original study: 18.12.2023 / 07:10 / GMT----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX---------------------------------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,thyssenkrupp nucera AG & Co.

Nevertheless, in the short term, the market should remain cautious with regard to the Group's cash situation: should Banishers fall short of expectations or fail, the credit lines negotiated would not be sufficient and Focus would be forced to take an AK', he warns.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Against this backdrop, Oddo BHF is 'fully convinced that Vinci's performance in 2024 could be underpinned by a better valuation of renewable activities'. However, 'in the short term and after the strong performance driven by CMD expectations, performance could be less glorious'. The broker adds that the current valuation looks particularly attractive in a context of good operating performance (FCF yield 2024e of ~7% and a dividend yield of ~4%).

The research firm announced on Tuesday that it had initiated coverage of Syensqo shares with a buy recommendation and a price target of 117 euros.From the analyst's point of view, the demerger with Solvay represents the culmination of a process that has constantly characterized the chemical industry over the last ten years, namely that of a gradual shift from traditional markets to so-called ""specialty"" segments, generating greater profitability, cash flow and stock market valuation.Beyond these purely sectoral considerations, however, the intermediary believes that Syensqo offers investors a ""rare"" lever to position themselves in a specialty chemicals specialist with a cutting-edge portfolio.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Despite the benefits of this operation, the analyst points to the risk of short-term losses, citing in particular the oversupply of shares and uncertainties surrounding soda ash contracts for 2024.Also pointing to ""headwinds"" on Soda Ash & Derivatives (SA&D), Stifel expects earnings to decline for 2024 before a potential recovery the following year.  We are below our medium-term targets, but expect cash generation to be sufficient to meet the company's main priorities in terms of cash allocation, maintenance investment and dividend.According to Stifel, Solvay should maintain a 'very attractive' dividend policy. The company also ranks first in terms of dividend yield among the broker's coverage.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Europe's largest copper producer is investing a further 330 million euros in its Hamburg site. This includes the construction of a new plant for processing precious metals with an investment volume of 300 million euros, as the MDax group announced. At its most recent meeting, the Supervisory Board also approved a 30 million euro investment in a plant to reduce fugitive emissions in copper production. Together with previously approved projects, Aurubis is currently investing more than 750 million in its plant at its Hamburg headquarters.      Experts from Morgan Stanley criticized that the new investment plans were accompanied by rather limited predictability with regard to the future profit contribution. The company had not announced a target for the profit contribution of the projects.      With the price slide on Tuesday, the shares fell to their lowest level since October. They had recovered to 82.50 euros by mid-November, but have recently come under pressure again./mis/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Aurubis AG,NDA,DE0006766504,Equities,Specialty Mining & Metals

In our view, the slowdown in growth observed in Q2 (corresponding to calendar Q3) is continuing, although demand has not fallen sharply of late. The Group would also point out that the basis for comparison will become difficult in Europe and Japan in Q3, and will be very difficult in Q4 across all geographies (double-digit growth in all zones in Q4 of the previous fiscal year)' says the research firm. Oddo BHF has lowered its sales growth forecasts at cc for the next two quarters to better reflect its more cautious sector scenario.' We expect overall growth to be +7.2% in Q3 (vs. +8.9%) and then 0% in Q4 (+3.7% previously), with Maisons Joaillères at +9% in Q3 (+10% prec.) and +0% in Q4 (+4% prec.) and Horlogers Spécialisés at +3% in Q3 (+8% prec.) and -1% in Q4 (+3% prec.)' announces the analyst's office.  We have marginally adjusted the forecast for group sales growth for the year to end March 2025 (from +6.1% to +5.9%), reflecting Maisons Joaillères at +6.5% versus +7% prec. We are not significantly modifying our EBIT margin scenario: H2 margin FY March 2024 expected at 20.7% (vs. 22.5% previous year), FY March 2025 margin expected at 23.9% (24.1% prec.), FY March 2026 at 24.7% (24.9% prec.). All in all, an adjustment of -1% on EBIT March 2024 and -2% for March 2025 and March 2026' adds Oddo BHF. On the subject of YNAP, Oddo BHF points out that the alternative solution being explored by Richemont at this stage is not the reintegration of YNAP as such into the Group's perimeter, but rather a new agreement with other partners, including both a financial and technological component (avenues are obviously being explored).' The stock's discount to the LVMH sector benchmark increased visibly over the course of 2023, and has remained close to -30% for several months now. For us, such a valuation represents an opportunity relative to the rest of the sector, as 1/ we have no doubts about Maisons Joaillères' ability to hold its own in the luxury sector, which gives the stock a profile that is no riskier than average in the current downturn, but remains attractive in the event of a recovery. Oddo BHF reiterates its Outperform recommendation, with a price target raised slightly from CHF 126 to CHF 130.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

For 2024, the Group anticipates a decline in dealer inventory levels across the market as a whole, given the sharp rise in interest rates, as well as a further slowdown in demand for small units. As a result, Oddo BHF has lowered its estimates for 2024 and 2025 Boat sales by 6% to ME1,226 and ME1,287 respectively. For 2025, management is still aiming for sales of between 1.5 and 1.65 billion euros.

At 09:31 GMT, Alstom was up 0.73% at 11.72 euros, while the CAC 40 was up 0.8% at the same time.               On Friday, JP Morgan lowered its recommendation on the stock from ""overweight"" to ""neutral"", and reduced its target price by 20%, to 14.4 euros.               Alstom's financing plan, which calls for raising 2 billion euros through asset sales and a potential capital increase, adds to the uncertainty, explains the bank, which stresses that the company will need time to regain investor confidence.               ""While we still like the visibility of backlog earnings, the debate now revolves around liquidity and earnings quality, concerns that will remain salient until the operating cycle shows sustainable improvement,"" JP Morgan explains.               The bank is concerned about Alstom's future orders, as the group's management has stated that inflation and rising rates are causing customers to delay their decisions.               The high order-to-bill ratios of rivals Siemens and Stadler show that Alstom's market share is at risk, JP Morgan adds.               The bank also downgraded its recommendation for Stadler Rail from ""neutral"" to ""underweight"", judging orders to be at an all-time high and citing high risks to margin prospects.               Alstom's valuation remains ""attractive"", according to the broker, who expects it to post good earnings growth over the next two years, as it replaces loss-making Bombardier Transportation contracts with more profitable projects.               Alstom shares have lost almost half their value this year. (Written by Olivier Sorgho, edited by Kate Entringer)",© Reuters - 2023,Alstom,ALO,FR0010220475,Equities,Heavy Machinery & Vehicles

Within the industry, Remy Cointreau stands out as the most attractive since its PE premium to the sector has halved. For now, Pernod is preferred relative to Diageo owing to its lower exposure to the US and its ability to capitalize on the potential rebound in China. Campari is not worth the effort.FACTIn this spirits’ sector note, we take a close look at the current industry challenges and opportunitiesANALYSISAlthough the COVID era was a golden age for spirits companies, the industry has somewhat sobered up since the beginning of the year with profit warnings from Remy Cointreau and Diageo, and Pernod Ricard and Campari missing expectations. Furthermore, the recent months have seen pressure on spirits stocks due to apprehension about GLP-1 treatments. Currently, our spirits coverage trades at 20.4x the 12m forward PE, or a 27.6% discount vs. the past decade. Additionally, Beverages share prices have underperformed the STOXX 600 by 24% YTD (chart below).Source: AlphaValue Analysis, Bloomberg dataSource: AlphaValue Analysis, Bloomberg data
While we remain optimistic about the industry’s long-term prospects there are still too many downside risks that lead us to err on the side of caution about spirits in the short term, despite their compelling valuations.US reverts to pre-Covid consumption patterns: Following the stellar performance during Covid (lockdowns and stimulus cheques) driven by premiumization, consumption remains heavily impacted by the reversal to pre-Covid consumption patterns amplified by the macroeconomic headwinds. Elevated inventory levels and the absence of a clear outlook are ongoing concerns for the industry. This reversal is impacting all alcohol categories with the cognac market experiencing specific shifts: i) consumers switching to more affordable bottles, propelled by heightened promotional strategies among certain players, favouring the VS category, and ii) a gradual erosion of market share to tequila. Does this deceleration in Cognac indicate a lasting change? We do not take this view; historically, the Cognac sector has endured rocky periods only to see renewed growth. Most industry research underscores the segment’s robust underpinnings, highlighting the substantial appeal for Cognac, particularly for select brands like Remy Martin.China plays a critical role in spirits demand: China had been expected to be a major growth catalyst but its GDP recovery is proving slower than expected. Although in recent weeks there’s been more of a stabilization trend in consumption than a decline (an improvement noticed in both the off-trade and on-trade, with the latter facing more challenges), the possibility of a full-on rebound remains fragile for now. The real estate crisis and high unemployment rates in the country continue to impact consumer confidence.In Europe: consumers continue to face challenges due to a deteriorating macroeconomic landscape.
Best spirit picks?
In our view it is still too early to dive into Spirits, but below we give an overview of the four beverage stocks with our take on the current headwinds and the potential share price catalysts.
Diageo: BUY recommendation – 42.6% upside potential
The recent downward revision of the MT organic operating profit growth outlook, announced during the profit warning and confirmed in the CMD two weeks ago, doesn’t alter our long-term conviction on this blue chip company. Operating profit is now expected to grow by +5% to +7% (vs. +6% to +9% previously), roughly in line with the organic top-line growth (through a combination of +2% volume, +1% to +2% pricing and, +2% to 3% of mix premiumization). The revised outlook appears more effectively to reflect the prevailing macroeconomic challenges. As inflation falls and aligns with projected productivity savings of $2bn spanning from FY 2025 to FY 2027 (derived from COGS improvements, enhanced marketing efficiency and streamlined overheads), Diageo’s organic operating profit is expected to outpace revenue growth in the long run. However, the company has refrained from committing to a specific timeline. Additionally, Diageo has unveiled its intentions to bolster A&P investments, aiming at augmenting brand value, potentially by concentrating efforts on the US market, where the company has seen a decline in its market share.
The profit warning impacting Diageo’s outlook has carried significant weight: despite being the No.1 worldwide – with its best-in-class mix, geographical diversification and strong portfolio – Diageo is not immune to the industry challenges. Despite the management’s reassurance, uncertainties persist regarding consumer circumstances and the lack of visibility surrounding inventories held by retailers and wholesalers across the LatAm region. Consequently, we eagerly await the H1 results for further insights.
During the recent CMD, the company highlighted a positive trend in holiday spending in the US; the management expects a sequential improvement for H1 FY 2024 vs. H2 FY 2023 (AVe: +1.0% yoy). However, the lack of positive comments from the entire industry in the region, along with the high level of inventory and the ongoing rapid normalization, was not reassuring. Additionally, with its low exposure to China (4% of the group’s top line), Diageo cannot bank on a Chinese rebound to partly offset the US slowdown.Our take – Like all the other spirits companies, Diageo’s 12m forward PE (chart below) is trading at a discount vs. its 10y average (5.9% discount). However, Diageo is currently trading at a 16.7% discount vs. our spirits coverage whereas, over the last decade, the company traded at a 20.3% discount. We are inclined to stay away at least until the H1 report (release date: 30/1/2024). Positive developments in the US towards normalization would be beneficial for the whole industry. This would nonetheless serve as a key driver for Diageo, which derives roughly 50% of its EBIT from this country. Further details on the LatAm developments would help.Source: AlphaValue Analysis, Bloomberg dataSource: AlphaValue Analysis, Bloomberg data
Pernod Ricard: BUY recommendation – 35.1% upside potential
While the company has confirmed its FY 2024 outlook in the US (around +2% yoy, with the help of low comps for H2) and provided encouraging news from China, its share price has underperformed the STOXX 600 by -10% since its Q1 results on 19/10/2023 (while outperforming our spirits coverage by +4.8%). The primary reasons behind this are the subdued conditions in the US and the hesitant recovery observed in China. Additionally, the modest performance in India can be attributed, for the most part, to the suspension of the company’s license in New Delhi. While there is no new information on the situation, the license was suspended in Q1 last year, therefore the remainder of FY 2024 will not be impacted.
While Pernod Ricard is less premium than Diageo (and is thus less likely to be affected by consumer downtrading), the read-across from Diageo’s profit warning could result in similar weaknesses for the French group (c.7.5% of the group’s top line vs. 11% for Diageo in LatAm). Although none of this was disclosed during the H1 results one month ago, it’s possible that the bad news might come out during the Q2.Our take – There is currently neither a premium nor a discount (chart below) on Pernod’s 12m forward PE vs. Diageo, its closest peer (17.0x). This is consistent with the trend observed in the last 10 years and 4 years (18.1x and 21.7x respectively). Although we prefer the Diageo equity story, Pernod Ricard remains our top pick in the short-term: i) with 12% of Pernod’s top line (vs. 4% for Diageo) coming from China, the company will enjoy easy comps. driving growth and above all, might provide leverage on a potential full recovery within the country ii) considering the lack of positive news coming from the US, its lower exposure to the country vs. Diageo is an advantage in the short term iii) the Indian fundamentals remain very strong, gaining market share (c.12% of Pernod’s top line vs. c.7% for Diageo).Source: AlphaValue Analysis, Bloomberg dataSource: AlphaValue Analysis, Bloomberg data
Remy Cointreau: ADD recommendation – 19.0% upside potential
Following two exceptional years (+74% cumulative organic growth between FY 2022 and FY 2023), Remy Cointreau is amongst the spirits companies to have struggled most YTD (having underperformed by -15% and -36% our spirits coverage and the STOXX 600 index respectively). The company has been hit hard by the reversal to pre Covid. The market didn’t react well to i) its initial announcement of flat organic sales growth for FY 2024 and, ii) later in the year, when it issued a profit warning and slashed its 2024 outlook from flat organic sales growth to -15% to -20%. After experiencing a significant drop in sales, Remy has disclosed a €100m cost-cutting program aimed at safeguarding its profitability. The program involves 60% one-off savings, including approximately €33m from A&P and €27m from overhead costs, while the remaining 40% represents structural savings, with around €16m attributed to A&P and €24m to overheads. Over the H1, the company achieved approximately €25m in cost savings, primarily stemming from reduced manufacturing, industrial and logistics expenses. Despite facing challenging times, Remy’s commendable level of transparency and information dissemination deserves recognition.
While during the H1 results last week some news from the US had been expected (the hottest topic for Remy), the market didn’t get much to sink its teeth into. The challenges in the US are threefold: of the -33% Q2 Cognac depletions i) -20% is related to normalization destocking, cash tension (both wholesalers and retailers) and lower consumer purchasing power ii) -8% decrease is linked to promotional activities, especially by Moët Hennessy, a strategy Remy largely avoids iii) the remaining -5% is attributed to Tequila and RTD market share gains (although those trends are easing). The Remy Martin VSOP bottle, which serves as an entry point for the Remy Martin brand (priced higher than competitor VS bottles), is encountering the most significant impact within the current landscape. This bottle has higher exposure to the Black/African demographic, which is experiencing notable challenges within the prevailing environment. Despite the slight improvement observed by the management in the short term, a return to sales growth for this product isn’t anticipated until FY 2025.
With approximately 27% of the group’s total revenue generated in China, the recent uptick in some sales is an encouraging sign although the recovery remains insufficiently robust. On one hand, the younger population is showing a more selective approach, targeting diverse occasions. On the other, consumers of the Louis XIII bottle tend to be older (between 50-60 years old), often successful real estate players who have been significantly affected by the current economic environment.Our take – Although there are potential downside risks for Remy, the current valuation offers an attractive entry point for a stock with solid fundamentals. Remy is currently trading at a 23.0× 12m forward PE, a premium of 13.2% vs. our spirits coverage while, over the last decade, Remy traded at a 26% premium (chart below). Whereas the three other spirits companies are currently trading at a 12m forward PE multiple discount of around 5-6% vs. the 10y average, Remy is trading at a -20% discount. Similarly to Pernod, a solid recovery in China would be advantageous for the company. Data indicating a stabilization in the market share of Cognac vs. Tequila would also be viewed positively. Lastly, the ongoing ramp-up phase of the L&S division should be appreciated by the market.Source: AlphaValue Analysis, Bloomberg dataSource: AlphaValue Analysis, Bloomberg data
Davide Campari-Milano: ADD recommendation – 32.4% upside potential
Despite a disappointing Q3, largely attributed to adverse weather conditions in Europe, consumer pressure in the region and a number of one-off events, Campari has shown greater resilience within the prevailing context. Indeed, since the beginning of the year Campari has outperformed our Spirits coverage by 28% and is currently trading at a 12m forward PE multiple premium of 21.5% vs. our spirits coverage, while over the last 10y the company traded at a 14.6% premium (chart below). This is primarily attributed to its distinctive profile and its emphasis on liqueurs/aperitifs (constituting approximately 60% of the group’s revenue). These beverages, frequently enjoyed in cocktails, are preferred by a younger urban demographic seeking to sustain their lifestyle, which appears to have been less affected by the economic circumstances. Over the last two years in the US for instance, the average monthly growth rate in retail value of cocktail consumption has been around 30% (vs. 17% for Tequila and 3.0%-4.0% for the other spirits category). Secondly, its exposure to Tequila in the US (around 25% of the US group’s top line) acts as a shield vs. normalization, as this category has continued to outperform the spirits industry. Lastly, although the company is ramping up its investment in aged spirits (cf. last idea kicker on Campari), its hitherto lower exposure has also shielded it from being as affected by this slowdown.
The upcoming retirement of the iconic Bob Kunze-Concewitz in April 2024, to be succeeded by Matteo Fantacchiotti, should see little change in the company’s strategy. On the contrary, appointing the former Managing Director of the APAC region indicates the company’s dedication to further fortifying its presence in this area. Matteo possesses a keen understanding of the APAC landscape and has been instrumental in enabling Campari to enhance its presence in key markets like India, Japan, South Korea and China.
Nevertheless, the company’s limited exposure to APAC restrains its ability to capitalize on the robust fundamentals of India and on the anticipated full recovery in China. Additionally, the ongoing conditions in China have further delayed the launch of Aperol on the Chinese market. This launch had already been postponed due to COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns.Our take – Campari’s unique profile likely presents fewer downside risks than its industry. However, the company is offering a symmetric limited upside in the short term. Its low exposure to China and aged spirits has proved to be a strength during this turbulent period but, once the trend reverses, these two factors might turn into weaknesses. From this perspective, we prefer Remy Cointreau.Source: AlphaValue Analysis, Bloomberg dataSource: AlphaValue Analysis, Bloomberg data",© Alphavalue - 2023,Diageo plc,DGE,GB0002374006,Equities,Distillers & Wineries

Yesterday, sales came in at 3,621.3 ME, in line with Oddo BHF's expectations.The analyst reports that management is confident about the outlook. Indeed, although the last few months have been in line with the end of the 2023 financial year, management anticipates a plateau in volumes and better price performance (cf. recent rise). Oddo BHF believes that the Group should benefit from an easing in electricity prices (gain of 15 ME) and leaves its EBITDA estimate unchanged (358.4 ME, i.e. +7% YoY), in line with consensus (354 ME), while management targets a figure in excess of 350 ME.'Valuation remains modest at 4.0x EBITDA and 6.7x EBIT 2024, reflecting a 36% discount to historical ratios.

The shares of the tourism group thus cost 6.60 euros and left the 100-day line behind, which they had recently clung to.      Analyst Richard Clarke from the investment bank Bernstein praised the fresh outlook for the 2024 financial year, saying that the management was more optimistic than the market consensus for the operating profit target of seven percent in his first commentary. In the medium term, the growth rates are a little more meagre, but even the longer-term targets will probably be more than met if a good year 2024 lays a very high foundation.      Tui's cash development in the final quarter looks better than expected, wrote analyst Cristian Nedelcu from UBS. Jefferies analyst James Wheatcroft emphasized the favorable valuation of Tui shares and the significantly lower debt.      The return of the desire to travel after the corona pandemic brought the world's largest travel group back into the black in the past financial year. Tui is now also considering leaving the London Stock Exchange and returning to the MDax. A stock exchange listing only in Germany could bring advantages for Tui in the view of the Management Board. These included a reduction in costs, compliance with EU requirements on airline ownership and control and an improvement in the equity profile./ajx/ag/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,TUI AG,TUI1,DE000TUAG505,Equities,Leisure & Recreation

On the trading platform Tradegate, the shares of the Darmstadt-based company plummeted by a good 11 percent to 143.50 euros in the first few minutes.       Barcalys expert Emily Field spoke of a bitter surprise. On the one hand, the tenor of the management regarding the potential of evobrutinib had recently been quite positive. And secondly, investors had been concerned, if at all, about the safety profile of the drug - and not its efficacy. According to the expert, removing the evobrutinib estimates from her valuation model would mean an overall discount of 3.5 percent.      Rajesh Kumar from HSBC reacted quickly and clearly - he removed his buy recommendation and cut the target price by 8 percent to 170 euros. In view of the hopes of a cash cow with sales in excess of one billion, he fears an overreaction on the market./ag/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Merck KGaA,MRK,DE0006599905,Equities,Pharmaceuticals

Aware of the risks inherent in this type of operation (which he considers more moderate), and of the macro risk (the company seems well equipped to face them)', the analyst nevertheless considers the stock market opportunity linked to this operation to be attractive.In addition, after half-year results judged to be very satisfactory and slightly ahead of expectations, Oddo BHF believes that Wavestone 'seems to be displaying a resilience in the current environment that the market has not hitherto recognized'.Stifel is also reaffirming its 'buy' recommendation and €60 price target on Wavestone, following the firm's publication of its results for the first half of 2023-24, marked by solid cost control and confirmation of annual targets.The broker also considers the group's targets to be cautious, as it believes it is ""in a position to increase its occupancy rate in the second half of the year"", but warns that ""visibility has been greatly reduced for calendar year 2024"".Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

In her view, the medical technology group is facing strong headwinds, less sales growth and higher costs. Verma's operating earnings estimates for 2024 and 2025 are up to 11 percent below consensus.      In a study published on Tuesday, the analyst therefore gave Carl Zeiss an ""Underweight"" rating with a price target of EUR 52. As a result, the shares fell by 3.7 percent to 79.40 euros to the bottom of the MDax. Since the beginning of the year, the shares have lost around a third of their market value and are among the weakest stocks in the index of medium-sized companies. The low for the year of 72.60 euros is not too far away.      Despite this weak share price performance in 2023, Verma makes it clear: ""We do not see a buying opportunity, but only an expression of the challenges Carl Zeiss Meditec is facing"". The share valuation remains unattractive. She also gave the shares ""Negative Catalyst Watch"" status ahead of the financial figures due in mid-December. The expert therefore expects further pressure on the share price and sees a considerable risk overall.      Traditionally, the shares of the Jena-based company would be rewarded with a valuation premium due to dynamic sales growth. However, headwinds are now threatening in China in particular, where Carl Zeiss generates a quarter of its turnover. In Europe and America, market share gains are only moderate due to strong competition. According to Verma, high costs are making it difficult to improve the margin in the short term.      On the cost side, the analyst particularly emphasizes the expenses for research and development, which have grown faster than sales. Carl Zeiss now spends 17 percent of its revenue on research, which is the highest percentage in the medical technology sector in Europe. Historically, expenditure has usually only been between 10 and 12 percent.      As an ophthalmology specialist, Carl Zeiss Meditec manufactures special lenses and surgical microscopes for ophthalmology. Verma sees ophthalmology as an attractive growth market, but prefers Alcon and EssilorLuxottica in this sector.      According to the ""Underweight"" rating, JPMorgan expects the share to underperform the respective sector over the next six to twelve months./niw/ag  Analyzing institute JPMorgan.

While it maintains its buy recommendation on Carlsberg, its preferred stock ('top pick') within the beverage sector in general remains Heineken.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

According to Oddo BHF, ABB is turning towards a new phase of growth (5-7% organic growth targeted vs. 3-5% previously) and should also accelerate its acquisition program (1-2% external growth vs. -2% over the 2020-2023 period).In this context, the analyst indicates that he has left his 2023 & 2024 forecasts unchanged and revised upwards his medium and long-term growth forecasts, taking into account in particular the dynamism of the underlying markets.

While sales were down 22% organically, underlying EBIT was down 43% organically, broadly in line with expectations (-41.6%). The analyst reports that cost savings in 1H24 amounted to €25 million, mitigating operational deleveraging.While short-term visibility is low, the company does not expect a rebound in US sales or moderate growth before 2025.

Oddo BHF also reviews the appointment of Conor McQuaid as head of North America, succeeding Ann Mukherjee.

This is the conclusion reached by the experts at Deutsche Bank Research on Wednesday in a sector outlook for 2024. The team of analysts led by Hadley Cohen raised the price targets for numerous stocks, and in some cases investment ratings were also revised upwards.      In the expectation that bond yields have peaked and the outlook for credit spreads remains subdued, the experts positively highlighted price increases in the property and casualty sector. Together with more resilient balance sheets, this is the right environment for European insurers to achieve above-average share price performance again in 2024 after an average year.      In this context, the experts describe those stocks as ""top picks"" that have recently lagged behind their industry peers in terms of share price, but whose business is gaining momentum. ASR, Direct Line and Legal & General were mentioned in this context. Axa and Scor with revaluation potential were also mentioned. They least favored the shares of Generali, Phoenix Group and Sampo.      There were various reclassifications in the study: In addition to the favorites Direct Line and Legal & General, the M&G shares were also freshly recommended as a buy. In contrast, the experts downgraded Aviva to ""Hold"". In recent years, the share had made the strongest gains among British life insurers, but now the air is largely out, they wrote.      Among the German stocks, Allianz remains a ""buy"" in times when large investments are necessary and in view of the expected consolidation. This is also a central argument for counting Axa among the favorites. The reinsurers Munich Re and Hannover Re are still rated ""Hold"" and ""Buy"" respectively, but the price target for both was raised slightly to 370 and 230 euros.      With a ""Buy"" rating, Deutsche Bank recommends buying the respective shares on the basis of the expected total return for the next twelve months. With a ""hold"" rating, neither a buy nor a sell is recommended./tih/ck/jha/  Analyzing institute Deutsche Bank.

Although the NAV has fallen slightly qoq (-0.9%) since June 30, 2023 (note that only the liquid assets and listed securities were revalued), it has nevertheless risen by 11.4% YTD for the first 9 months of 2023, reflecting the strength of IDI’s business model. 2023 is proving to be a banner year for IDI, which has completed a number of structuring transactions, including the creation of a third-party asset management business via iIdiCo, and the sale of Flex Composite Group to Michelin at a stellar cash-on-cash multiple of 12x. With investment capacity at record levels, IDI is in a prime position going forward. FACT
IDI’s NAV came to €724.5m (or €96.85 per share) as of September 2023 corresponding to a c.0.9% decrease qoq, although only the liquid assets and listed securities were revalued. YTD, the NAV increased by 11.4%. 
IDI, alongside Andera Partners, has announced that it completed the sale of Flex Composite Group, in which the initial investment was €23.2m in 2015, for an enterprise value of €700m, representing 12x the initial investment or an IRR of 38%, on 27 September 2023. 
As of September 2023, IDI has an investment capacity net of debt of €325m, compared with €74.1m at the end of H1-23.
Over the quarter, IDI announced 4 deals including 1 acquisition, 1 divestment and 2 build-ups.ANALYSISSignificant growth in the NAV YTD
This morning, IDI published its NAV as of September 2023. Although the NAV declined slightly by 0.9% qoq from €730.7m (€97.73 per share) to €724.5m (or €96.85 per share), investors have no reason to worry about NAV progression over 2023, all the more so in that only the active liquid assets and listed securities were revalued during the third quarter. 2023 augurs well for NAV growth reaching 11.4% YTD.
Still no fragility amidst the adverse market conditions
While the main private equity players continue to suffer from the difficult environment in terms of both financing and deal flow, IDI shows no signs of fragility in its portfolio rotation. YTD, IDI has completed 14 deals, including 5 disposals, 4 external growth transactions and 5 acquisitions. Among IDI’s most notable transactions were the completion of the acquisition of 40% of Omnes’ energy transition and innovation activities, the creation of IdiCo, and the sale of Flex Composite Group to Michelin for an EV of €700m, i.e. 12x its initial investment and an IRR of 38%, completed on 27 September 2023. In addition to these transactions, IDI also saw  (i) the disposal and subsequent reinvestment in Freeland, (ii) the investment in the major European player in the hybrid turf market, Natural Grass and (iii) the disposal of Fidinav, a group specialising in the maritime transportation of dry bulk, for an IRR of 6%.
With 2023 already well underway for IDI, the third quarter saw four new transactions, including (i) IDI’s acquisition of a majority stake (c.90%) in Prevost Laboratory Concept, a laboratory and manufacturer (CDMO) of cosmetics products and food supplements, (ii) the sale of VOIP, a BtoB telecoms operator, and (iii) two external growth transactions for Group Positive and CDS Groupe. 
Strong firepower following the sale of FCG
Following the sale of FCG, IDI has substantially improved its investment capacity net of debt, rising from €74.1m in H1-23 to €325m in September 2023, which should enable it to sustain its strong investment momentum and seize opportunities in 2024.
We reiterate our views expressed at the H1-2023 stage: IDI’s buoyant investment activity at a time when the private equity landscape had been expected to be hit by the slowdown in  deal flow and cutbacks in financing, makes IDI a compelling long-term play.IMPACTThis release should not have a material impact on our estimates.",© Alphavalue - 2023,IDI,IDIP,FR0000051393,Equities,Investment Management & Fund Operators

The company management is considering offering the Hamburg-based company more attractive conditions and opening up access to the Group's fast 5G network, according to the report.

The research firm points out that Sanofi this morning published the results of its second phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent in the treatment of chronic bronchitis (COPD). The results of the trial are ""positive and consistent"", and showed a 34% reduction in acute moderate to severe COPD exacerbations over a 52-week period.""The publication of these results comes almost 6 months ahead of our expectations, and should provide the market with some reassurance ahead of the R&D day scheduled for December 7"", stresses the analyst. Oddo BHF points out that these clinical results confirm the Group's ambitions in the treatment of COPD, and that the consensus is already for adjusted sales of €1.5 billion in 2030 in this indication (€1.8 billion unadjusted).  Upward revisions are likely to be measured, but positive sentiment on the stock this morning was exacerbated by its Q3 profit warning.

Costs in Europe pose challenges for the chemical company with its Verbund principle, which will probably have an impact on profitability in the short and medium term, analyst Charles Webb wrote in a study published on Monday.      The shares are comparatively expensive, he said, justifying the lowering of his investment rating from ""Equal-weight"" to ""Underweight"". As a result, he expects a below-average total return compared to other sector stocks under review. Morgan Stanley always takes a period of between twelve and 18 months as a basis. Webb cut the target price from 43 to 39 euros, which is around ten percent below the current price.      The structural development of the cost situation is not being adequately taken into account by BASF investors in a global context, the expert emphasized. He therefore puts a question mark over the extent, speed and timing of a business recovery, which is already priced into consensus expectations. It will be more difficult for the Ludwigshafen-based company to keep its promises in terms of growth, dividends and sustainability.      According to the analyst, higher oil, gas and electricity prices as well as the stricter regulatory environment mean that Europe is now at the top of the global cost curve. According to Webb, the resulting reduction in global competitiveness represents a strong headwind for a large integrated manufacturer such as BASF in times of demand-driven low capacity utilization.      Coupled with rather low demand for the time being in the particularly important automotive and agricultural end markets, it is likely that the phase of low capacity utilization will last longer. The expert therefore lowered his expectations for the 2024 financial year to a level below the average analyst estimates (consensus). He now does not expect a significant recovery until 2025./tih/ck/mis      Publication of the original study: 27.11.2023 / 04:00 / GMT First dissemination of the original study: Date not specified in study / Time not specified in study / Time zone not specified in study",© dpa-AFX - 2023,BASF SE,BAS,DE000BASF111,Equities,Diversified Chemicals

Dwindling tailwinds, increasing competition, structural changes and cyclical pressure call for new strategies and a strong market position.      In his study published on Thursday, analyst Jo Barnet-Lamb lists a number of important factors that investors should take into account when making their choice in the face of growing economic uncertainty and makes some changes to previous investment assessments.      The British company Rightmove, which is active in the real estate market, is his ""Top Pick"". He rates the share accordingly as a ""Buy"" and sees the target price at 688 pence. He downgraded the share of the British car dealer Auto Trade, which was recently rated ""Neutral"", to ""Sell"" and sees the target price at 613 pence after 640 pence previously.Scout24 , on the other hand, was upgraded to ""Neutral"" and given a target price of EUR 66, after the shares had previously been rated ""Sell"" with a target price of EUR 54.30. The shares of the Norwegian operator of classifieds portals, Adevinta, were downgraded to ""Neutral"" and the target price was reduced from 115 to 109 kroner.      According to Barnet-Lamb, operators of online classifieds marketplaces are struggling with the loss of the tailwind that the migration from print to online ads gave them more than a decade ago. Digital penetration is already very advanced in the most important markets in Europe - especially in the UK. Of the four companies he analyzed, only Adevinta and, to a lesser extent, Scout24 were still able to benefit from this tailwind. In the UK, on the other hand, migration is already in the 90 percent range.      It is therefore important for online portal operators to focus on monetization, i.e. how much more of their customers' turnover or profit pool they spend on classifieds. New growth paths are also important. He sees healthy scope for monetization at all four companies, although he considers the upside potential at Adevinta to be greater than at Auto Trader and Rightmove. Scout24 is in the midfield in terms of the intensity of monetization.      As the competitive positions play an important role in monetization and customer loyalty, Barnet-Lamb also examined these. Here he concludes that Rightmove and Auto Trader are ahead in their areas, which gives them strong pricing power. ""Scout24 is also a clear market leader, but less dominant than Rightmove,"" he concludes.      In order to continue to grow, online marketplace operators are also trying to penetrate ""adjacent areas"". New ""adjacent"" products and services are intended to increase their reach and customer base. He praised the fact that ""all companies have made considerable progress in adjacent areas.""      Last but not least, the UBS expert also points to cyclical risks and the ""ecosystem stability"" in the sector. Against the backdrop of rising interest rates and high inflation as well as the slowdown in the global economy, cyclicality is also coming more into focus. In addition, customers, such as real estate agents and used car dealers, are exposed to long-term structural changes, which also have an impact on marketplace operators.      In view of all these driving and braking factors for the sector, Barnet-Lamb considers Rightmove to be particularly attractive. In addition to the favorable share valuation, he points above all to the growth in the core business, which can withstand cyclical downturns. The service provider's new strategy for real estate listings should also noticeably accelerate earnings growth. Auto Trader, on the other hand, is most susceptible to short-term cyclical pressure and longer-term structural changes. However, the high valuation of the share does not reflect this.      For Scout24, the analyst assesses the long-term growth opportunities positively, but sees short-term risks, for example due to a deterioration in the economic environment and possibly too high analysts' expectations. In addition, the shares are coming out of a phase of prolonged above-average price increases.      Adevinta benefits from its superior growth profile, as the company was an early player in the online classifieds market. However, the Norwegian company's share price is currently not dependent on fundamentals, partly due to a takeover bid from financial investors Permira and Blackstone.      With its ""Buy"" rating, UBS assumes that the total return on the share (price gain plus dividend) will be at least six percent above the market return it expects over the next twelve months. With a ""Neutral"" rating, the total return over the next twelve months is expected to be up to six percent above or below the expected market return. At ""Sell"", the total return is expected to be at least six percent below the market return expected by UBS./ck/jsl/he  Analyzing institute UBS.",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Scout24 SE,G24,DE000A12DM80,Equities,Internet Services

As a reminder, Elior reported organic growth of 11.2% for fiscal 2023 (consensus was 10.7%, Stifel 11.6%). Adjusted EBIT (59 ME) came in 18% above expectations (50 ME), despite a weaker-than-expected FCF in the 2nd half, at -84 ME, versus -11 ME anticipated by Stifel. For 2024, Elior is targeting sales growth of 4 to 5%, compared with the consensus of 5.9% and Stifel's 6%. Elior is targeting an adjusted EBIT margin of 2.5%, in line with the consensus, while Stifel is at 1.8%. The analyst believes that the outlook for fiscal 2024 is 'slightly below expectations at sales level, but broadly in line at margin level, with an expected improvement supported by an easing of inflationary pressure.' 'Although we regard the sales guidance as conservative, we perceive the margin target as ambitious at this stage, although it could be achieved if the deceleration in inflation continues over the coming months' the broker judges.

""We also appreciate Pernod Ricard's prudence, which was already drawing attention to the 'Latam' (Latin America) market in September (pre-quiet call), two months before Diageo's warning"", stresses the broker.As a reminder, the 'Latam' spirits market has to contend with high inventory levels at wholesalers and a slowdown in local consumption. Oddo BHF believes that Pernod Ricard will be less affected than its British counterpart Diageo, due to its lower exposure to this market, a different positioning and a product mix that protects it more than Diageo's downtrading.""We have revised our organic sales growth estimates to -0.7% in FY 23/24th in the Americas vs. +0.7% previously and +1.1% for the consensus. At group level, we now expect organic sales growth of 3.6% in FY 23/24e vs. 4% previously, and EPS growth of 0.1% vs. 0.5% previously', concludes the analyst.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

They recently fell by a good three percent to just under 33 euros, threatening to fall below the low of 32.60 euros at the beginning of the week - their lowest level since 2006.      Traders saw a media report that the acquired US company Monsanto had been sentenced by a US court to pay damages in the hundreds of millions of dollars as slightly negative for the share price. However, the billion-dollar glyphosate defeat in the USA and the discontinuation of a clinical trial with a drug hopeful continued to weigh more heavily.      Investors continued to sell into any slight stabilization, said one trader. This had already been observed on the previous day, when the supply of shares repeatedly outweighed supply above 34 euros.

After strong fluctuations in pre-market trading, the bears finally prevailed in Xetra trading: The shares fell by 23 percent to 16.48 euros. At the low, the loss even amounted to around a third. This was the lowest level since the beginning of April.      The share price has recently more than halved in just eight trading days. Analysts at the investment bank Van Lanschot Kempen wrote of a ""continued downside potential due to the uncertainty surrounding the approval of the cancer drug"". This was accompanied by financial risks and the company's cash resources were ""relatively tight"" with a view to 2025. The experts halved their price target from 20 to 10 euros, signaling further downside risks.      Analyst Rajan Sharma from Goldman Sachs had already predicted a massive weakness in the share price. In his initial reaction, the expert wrote that although the cancer drug had reached the primary endpoint, it lacked statistical significance in an important secondary endpoint for assessing symptom reduction.      On the trading platform Lang & Schwarz, Morphosys shares had initially risen sharply to almost EUR 30 compared to the Xetra close the previous evening. However, they then turned negative. On the pre-market trading platform Tradegate, the losses then widened massively.      From a technical point of view, the picture has clouded over considerably. On Thursday last week, the shares of the developer of anti-cancer drugs had already fallen below the 200-day line, which is considered an indicator of the longer-term trend. At prices below 11.80 euros, the shares would fall to their lowest level since 2009.      Since the multi-year high of EUR 146.30 in January 2020, the shares have only gone in one direction - down. At the beginning of 2020, Morphosys was at times worth well over four billion euros on the stock exchange. It is now worth just over 550 million euros./bek/ag----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,MorphoSys AG                                                                                                        Xetra,MOR,DE0006632003,Equities,Biotechnology & Medical Research

The share price fell by three percent to 17.855 euros in the morning. This made the shares the third biggest loser in the MDax behind Gea Group and Teamviewer. The recovery of recent weeks could therefore be over for the time being.      One trader attributed the price losses to arbitrage, which is often common with convertible bonds. Investors bought the bonds and paid for them by selling shares into which the convertible can later be converted. From the perspective of the risk position, a long position in the bond was therefore offset by a short position in the share./bek/tih",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Evonik Industries AG,EVK,DE000EVNK013,Equities,Specialty Chemicals

After strong fluctuations in pre-market trading, the bears finally prevailed in Xetra trading: The shares fell by up to almost a third to 14.52 euros.      This was the lowest level since the beginning of April. The shares have recently lost more than half their value in just eight trading days. Analyst Rajan Sharma from Goldman Sachs had already predicted a massive weakness in the share price. Although the cancer drug met the primary endpoint, it lacked statistical significance in an important secondary endpoint for assessing symptom reduction, the expert wrote in his initial reaction.      Analyst James Gordon from JPMorgan had also expected a below-average share price reaction to the study data before the start of trading. He wrote of mixed results for the cancer drug. For the courageous in the market, however, this could possibly offer entry opportunities.      On the trading platform Lang & Schwarz, Morphosys shares had initially risen sharply to almost 30 euros compared to the Xetra close the previous evening. However, they then turned negative. On the pre-market trading platform Tradegate, the losses then widened massively.      From a technical point of view, the picture has clouded over considerably. On Thursday last week, the shares of the developer of anti-cancer drugs had already fallen below the 200-day line, which is considered an indicator of the longer-term trend. At prices below 11.80 euros, the shares would fall to their lowest level since 2009.      Since the multi-year high20 of EUR 146.30 in January 2020, the share price has only moved in one direction - downwards. At the beginning of 2020, Morphosys was at times worth well over four billion euros on the stock exchange.

""Asundexian's promising prospects were the reason why we upgraded Bayer shares to ""Overweight"" in April 2022,"" wrote analyst Emily Field in a study published on Monday. However, the fact that the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) has now recommended the premature termination of the Oceanic-AF study due to lack of efficacy is an ""absolute surprise"" for her. Field therefore promptly downgraded the shares of the agrochemical and pharmaceutical company to ""Equal Weight"" and cut the target price from EUR 65 to EUR 40. In view of the current share price slump of around 20 percent, this still represents a price potential of around one fifth.      Asundexian, now in the decisive study phase III, was investigated in comparison to the competitor drug apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation and stroke risk as part of the overall Oceanic phase III development program and has now been terminated prematurely. However, Field argues that this has dashed hopes that Asundexian would help Bayer to return to growth after the expiry of the patents for the anticoagulant Xarelto and the eye drug Eylea.      Accordingly, the Barclays expert sees considerable challenges for Bayer's pharmaceuticals business. In January, Bayer was still forecasting peak sales potential of more than EUR 5 billion for asundexiane, which has been advanced in pivotal studies in both atrial fibrillation (Oceanic-AF) and stroke (Oceanic-Stroke). She herself had estimated peak sales of 6.5 billion euros in the atrial fibrillation segment in her valuation model.      Now, however, a lower valuation is appropriate again, even though Bayer ""clearly still has strategic options"" for the company ahead of the capital markets day on March 5, Field wrote.      The analysts at Barclays Capital expect the shares to perform roughly in line with the other stocks in the sector under review over the next twelve months, with a rating of ""Equal Weight""./ck/mne/jha/  Analyzing institute Barclays Capital.

The research firm is also cautious about 2026. While Soitec is targeting sales of $2.1 billion by 2026, Stifel is more modestly targeting $1.8 billion (versus $1.9 billion in its previous estimate). Nonetheless, Stifel points to long-term growth opportunities for Soitec, including potential boosts from the development of 5G and electric vehicles.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

The ""fintech"" share lost nearly 4% to 13.2 euros in early trading, before recovering.               Goldman Sachs lowered its forecast for Worldline's sales growth and margins to 2027, pointing to ""the termination of risky contracts in the Merchant Services division, lower-than-expected price recasting in (contract) renewals, and poor execution in the Financial Processing division's product range"".

Barclays expert Emily Field was caught on the wrong foot by the failure of the anticoagulant and promptly canceled her recommendation for Bayer shares. She lowered her price target from 65 to 40 euros.      After the Asundexian failure, she initially sees immense difficulties for the pharmaceutical business of the Leverkusen-based company. A lower valuation is appropriate in view of the uncertainty for the future after the patent expirations of Xarelto and Eylea - now without Asundexian./ag/nas",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Bayer AG,BAYN,DE000BAY0017,Equities,Pharmaceuticals

However, with net debt reaching E3.4 bn at the end of September (versus E2.1 bn at the end of March) and Moody's negative outlook on its Baa3 rating, Alstom announced a series of measures to strengthen its balance sheet, including a 1.8% reduction in headcount (or 1,500 people) and E2 bn of inorganic measures, including E0.5-1 bn in divestments.'While the option of a capital increase is still on the table (25% dilution, based on a share price of E10 for E920), we believe that this has already been largely priced in, and above all will not be favored by the Group in the short term', concludes the broker.

The main factor impacting our revenue estimates is Chargeurs Luxury Fibers, whose sales are expected to decrease significantly vs. 2022 due to a negative price effect (strong drop in the conventional wool price (i.e.: micron 17 down by -30% on Q3 and -21% for 9M 23), and a change in product mix (less conventional and growing certified Nativa wool).

In terms of margins, the main drivers of our downward revision are (i) we had been overly optimistic about Fashion Technologies' margins considering the figures published in H1 23, (ii) we have removed the Healthcare solutions division, which is no longer contributing to Chargeurs' sales and underlying profit, (iii) we have aligned our numbers with the guidance provided by Chargeurs for Museum Studio as we had been a bit too bullish and (iv) as we did not have any information on Swaine, and given the scale-up work that will require opex, we had assumed that Swaine would be consolidated in 2024 and will not contribute to margins. 

In 2024, our estimates have been negatively impacted mainly by the downward revision of our estimates for Museum Studio. 

Despite these revisions, we remain positive overall especially on CAM, on which we are confident of a rebound, leading to similar margins in absolute terms, despite the fall in our revenue estimates.CHANGE IN NAV€ 28.1 vs 32.2 -12.9%Given that we have based our NAV valuation on EV/EBITDA multiples with an average estimated EBITDA for 2023, 2024 and 2025, the downward revision to our EBITDA forecasts has penalised our NAV estimate. Specifically, consistent with the downward revision of our EBITDA estimates for Chargeurs Fashion Technology, the division's valuation has fallen from €300m to €270m.  In addition, we have removed Healthcare solutions, which has also penalised our NAV.CHANGE IN DCF€ 11.8 vs 17.0 -30.6%The sharp fall in our DCF comes from the downward revisions to our FY 23-24 EPS forecasts (see EPS commentary). In 2023, we now expect revenues of €669m (vs. €702m) and an underlying operating profit of €27m (vs. €35m), representing a margin of 4% (vs. 5%). In 2024, we expect revenues of around €753m, compared with €788m previously, and an underlying operating profit of €43m (or a margin of 5.7%), compared with €49m (or a margin of 6.2%).",© Alphavalue - 2023,Chargeurs,CRI,FR0000130692,Equities,Consumer Goods Conglomerates

The analyst points out that earnings from renewable energies were in line with consensus expectations. Against this backdrop, RWE confirmed its full-year forecasts, implying weak contributions from Hydro/Biomass/Gas and Supply&Trading in Q4-23.

As part of this analysis, Oddo BHF considers Publicis to be less attractive in the sector, with a target of 77 E. WPP is the most attractive stock with a target of 1150p.' It seems to us that 2024 should be a pivotal year and that the agency model should profoundly evolve thanks to AI. The current balances between headcount, sales, investments, margins and cash flow should have profoundly changed within 2 to 3 years' says Oddo BHF. The analyst expects several changes as early as 2024. In order, we expect: a) an increase in investments in AI from 2024, notably via the development of AI platforms and securing access to GPU chips; b) significant productivity gains and therefore an acceleration of reorganizations and major restructuring charges from 2024; c) a reduction in branch headcount and therefore lower production costs; d) lower service prices for customers in light of productivity gains. According to Oddo BHF, there could be renewed consolidation. WPP is holding a CMD in January 2024, which should be an opportunity to get many details on the strategy envisaged. ' It also seems likely to us that Publicis will use the presentation of its annual results to communicate on its plan around AI and the possible change of model ' adds the analyst firm. Oddo BHF believes that AI will drive consolidation between major agencies ' In this irremediably deflationary context, we believe that some agencies could seek to join forces or acquire others in order to pool their investments (technological and restructuring), secure a leading position in the ' media ' market, facilitate their restructuring and thus increase their FCF '.' Publicis could be a credible buyer. It enjoys a favorable valuation relative to its peers, thanks to its recent momentum. The group could seek to reproduce the pattern of 2013 when the merger with Omnicom was aborted. Interpublic and WPP could logically be targets, but could also be looking to undertake a tie-up. This is obviously only theoretical, but it seems to us that AI will irrevocably lead to consolidation between major agencies, and any move seems possible to us' notes Oddo BHF.

The Visible Alpha consensus pre-release estimate was for sales of 10,321 ME (Q2 at +6.5% cc), EBIT of 2,844 ME (margin 27.6%) and net income of 2,001 ME. The publication comes in slightly below expectations on activity (the deceleration suffered by the luxury sector in Q2 is no longer a surprise), but the gap is more visibly negative (at c.-7% vs. consensus)' stresses the analyst's office.' Japan is still growing strongly at +12% (Q1+14%), but Asia Pacific is posting lower growth at +8% after Q1 at +40%, boosted by the comparison base in China '. Oddo BHF points out that by division, the contrast is marked between a good performance by Maisons Joaillères at +9% cc in Q2 after +24% in Q1 (we expected 9%), while Specialized Watchmakers posted a decline of 4% in Q2 after +10% in Q1 (we expected +4%)' By division, Maisons Joaillères' EBIT margin in H1 reached 35.5% vs. 37.1% in H1 of the previous year (currency impact estimated at -280 bp) and held up rather better than the Group average, helped by the continuing favorable trend in sales (we were expecting 36.5%). For Specialized Watchmakers, the H1 margin slumped more visibly to 19.7% (vs. 24.8% in H1 of the previous year, we were expecting 24.5%)' adds the analyst.Oddo BHF indicates that the EBIT revision for this year is -8%. The adjustment is less significant for March 2025 (-5%) and March 2026 (-4%).  Organic growth for March 2024 is now expected to be 9% (previous 10%), with an EBIT margin of 23.3% (previous 25.1%). For March 2025, we still expect sales growth of c.+6%, with a lower margin of 24.1% (25.1% prev.). Finally, for March 2026, we maintain growth slightly above 7%, with the margin reduced from 25.6% to 24.9%. Oddo BHF has confirmed its Outperform recommendation and adjusted its price target down from CHF 133 to CHF 126 to reflect our new estimates, which lead to a slightly less favorable long-term margin scenario.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

As analyst Gunther Zechmann wrote in a study published on Monday in a review of the quarterly figures, Bayer probably wanted to send three important signals. Expectations for the pharmaceuticals and agriculture businesses are still too high for 2024, employees want a cultural change and management compensation will be much more closely aligned with the share price in the future. With regard to the latter, it makes sense for the share price to be low at the beginning of a new ""incentive year"". However, Bayer also has opportunities to boost the share price, for example by cutting costs, restructuring, streamlining management and other measures. Against this background, short-term price weaknesses could be good opportunities./mis/ag  Publication of the original study: 12.11.2023 / 22:13 / UTC First dissemination of the original study: 13/11/2023 / 05:03 / UTC----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Bayer AG,BAYN,DE000BAY0017,Equities,Pharmaceuticals

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CHARGEURS-5218/news/Chargeurs-The-worst-is-over-as-Chargeurs-Advanced-Materials-is-on-the-comeback-trail-45308746/,CHARGEURS  :  The worst is over as Chargeurs Advanced Materials is on the comeback trail,"November 13, 2023 at 02:44 am EST","The worst is over as Chargeurs Advanced Materials is on the comeback trailEARNINGS/SALES RELEASESChargeurs continued to be negatively impacted by a still-difficult environment for its various businesses in the Q3 23, with a 7.6% organic decline in revenues.  However, the worst now seems to be over as the recovery in the Advanced Materials division is showing signs of picking up pace, with the monthly volumes in September and October higher than in 2022. Meanwhile, Chargeurs Museum Studio continues to assert itself as a new growth driver. The 2024 targets were reaffirmed.FACT
Chargeurs posted organic sales down 7.6% yoy to €150.8m in Q3 23, penalized by its Chargeurs Advanced Materials (ex-Protective film) and Chargeurs Luxury Fibers (CLF) businesses. 
The Technology and Luxury divisions posted organic declines of 6.1% and 12.3% respectively in the quarter, with sales of €112.7m and €38.1m.
In Q3 23, Chargeurs Advanced Materials recorded a 13.9% organic yoy drop in revenues to €64.1m which, in addition to being penalized by a difficult market, experienced a seasonality effect in August.
Chargeurs Luxury Fibers also recorded a sharp decline, -36.5% organic yoy, to €13.2m due to a negative price effect (strong drop in the conventional wool price (i.e.: micron 17 down -30% on Q3 and -21% for 9M 23), and a change in product mix (less conventional and rising certified Nativa wool), which Chargeurs does not expect to negatively impact the gross margin, as conventional sales have a lower margin compared with certified wool. 
On the other hand, the Museum Studio (CMS) business appeared robust, with 13.6% organic growth yoy and revenues of €22.8m for the quarter.
Chargeurs reaffirmed its 2024 outlook of sales in excess of €800m, an EBITDA margin of between 9% and 10% and a Debt/Ebitda multiple of less than 3x.ANALYSISChargeurs continues to be hampered by a challenging environment in 2023, which translated into a 7.6% yoy organic sales decline to €150.8m in the Q3. As mentioned before, the biggest underminer of Chargeurs’ performance is its macro proxy, Chargeurs Advanced Materials (CAM). Having enjoyed an exceptional 2021, boosted by an inventories build-up by clients, the business has had to contend with a destocking effect since 2022. That said, the division has now passed its nadir.
Chargeurs Advanced Materials set for a rebound 
In Q3 23, CAM reported a 13.9% yoy organic decline in revenues to €64.1m. While at first sight such a contraction may appear negative, it is actually positive when set against the 27% yoy lfl decline in the Q1 23 and the 19.2% yoy lfl decline in Q2-23. In spite of the complex market conditions and a seasonal August, volumes picked up in October for the fifth consecutive month, exceeding those recorded in the same period in 2022. The volume upturn in all regions – Asia, EMEA and the Americas – bears witness to an upswing.
No decline yet for the Fashion business 
While Chargeurs PCC Fashion Technologies (CFT PCC) reported a 12.9% yoy decline in absolute revenues in Q3 23 to €48.6m, the division recorded a 4.8% organic increase in revenues. CFT PCC enjoyed a positive price effect stemming partly from the hyperinflationary situation in Argentina, together with a favourable volume effect in Asia. Chargeurs does not seem concerned by the slight decline in European sales in Q3, as CFT PCC is planning to expand its global network across all apparel segments with an increasing market share.
Museums further established themselves as the Group’s new growth lever
Following on from the H1 23, Chargeurs Museum Studio (CMS) further asserted itself as the Group’s new growth lever, with revenues up 13.6% yoy to €22.8m, taking 9-month yoy organic growth to 35.9% with revenues of €84m. The division’s momentum continues to be positive with worldwide projects in the pipeline. Quite an impressive performance, bearing in mind the fact that the business was built from scratch, which led to the reiteration of the revenue guidance of €120m in 2023 and €150m in 2024.
Chargeurs Luxury Fibers’ sales in the red, although profitability should remain unaffected
Chargeurs Luxury Fibers (CLF) reported an organic yoy decrease of 36.5% with sales of €13.2m in the Q3 23 compared with €21.8m last year, due to lower conventional wool prices. Having said that, Chargeurs intends to pursue the premiumization of its business with growing sales linked to sustainable wool, Nativa, now accounting for 20% of sales versus 10% last year, a trend that is expected to enable CLF to maintain its operating margin. 
Positive initial results for Chargeurs Personal Goods
The Chargeurs Personal Goods division recorded a sound first set of 9-month figures, with revenues of around €6.2m. We don’t have a reference year, since the Cambridge Satchel and Altesse Studio brands were consolidated in December 2022, but we can however assert that the outlook for the division is good, with new partnerships expected for the Cambridge Satchel and new distributors, including Galeries Lafayette, for Altesse Studio. 
2024 outlook reaffirmed
Recent developments in terms of volumes suggest that CAM’s gradual recovery scenario is materializing, which we regard as a clear positive. Chargeurs thus confirmed its 2024 objectives of sales in excess of €800m, with an EBITDA margin of 9-10% and a debt/EBITDA multiple of less than 3x.IMPACTOur estimates are likely to remain broadly unchanged, although we are likely to revise downwards our revenue estimates for Chargeurs Luxury Fibers.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Chargeurs,CRI,FR0000130692,Equities,Consumer Goods Conglomerates

After the presentation of the figures, they initially accelerated their recovery movement that began in November with an initial price jump of up to eight percent. However, investors quickly used this to exit a share that has been one of the worst-performing SDax stocks so far in 2023. It has already lost more than half of its value this year.      The parent company of the Xing career network continues to struggle in a difficult market environment with meagre demand for its products, partly due to the current situation on the labor market and subdued demand for recruitment solutions. Although New Work exceeded market expectations in the third quarter, sales were disappointing./tih/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,New Work SE                                                                                                        Xetra,NWO,DE000NWRK013,Equities,Internet Services

After a weak start with a price slide to 34.24 euros, the shares turned positive and were trading at 35.96 euros in the afternoon, up 2.39 percent on the previous day's close.      In an initial reaction, expert Knut Woller from Baader Bank spoke of solid results, especially as the comparative figures from the previous year were very high. In addition, Compugroup should achieve its annual profit target, the lower end of the range seems less ambitious, the middle is achievable.      Analyst Yannik Siering from the investment house Stifel was also positive. Compugroup had even performed somewhat better than expected in the third quarter./mis/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,CompuGroup Medical SE & Co. KGaA,COP,DE000A288904,Equities,Software

The shares of the outdoor advertising service provider rose by almost 10 percent to 50 euros at midday. At its peak, the share price passed the round 50 euro mark. On the Paris stock exchange, shares in the advertising specialist JCDecaux also rose by 5 percent.      After another surprisingly strong quarter, Stroer is expecting continued momentum in the coming months. The order book for outdoor advertising in the fourth quarter is already well filled, the company announced.      ""In view of a weak German advertising market, Stroer has reported a strong third quarter,"" wrote analyst Marcus Diebel from JPMorgan in an initial reaction. For the Out-of-Home (OoH) segment, Stroer had forecast double-digit percentage growth. He had previously expected growth of 4.5 percent. And this at a time when TV broadcasters are struggling with a weakening advertising business.      With the high price gain, Stroer shares have broken out of a months-long sideways movement around the EUR 44 mark. For the first time since the beginning of June, they also overcame the 200-day line at just over 46 euros, which is considered an indicator of the longer-term price trend./bek/ajx/stk----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Ströer SE & Co.

The analyst believes that the 3rd quarter proved ""solid"" for Airbus Commercial (3.5% above consensus), even if it was masked by an exceptional charge estimated by Oddo at 300 ME on the Defense & Space division.  Adjusted FCF consumption was a little higher than expected (537 ME vs. 415 ME for the consensus), but was essentially due to an additional 1.1 MdE increase in inventories compared with the end of June, which in our view clearly secures the acceleration in deliveries at the end of the year"", notes the broker. Following this publication, Oddo BHF has marginally adjusted its EPS estimates by 0n3% in FY23, in order to take into account the charge in Space, which masks part of the stronger-than-expected improvement in Airbus Commercial.  Our FY24 EPS are reduced by 0.5% and FY25 EPS are raised by +0.4% to reflect adjustments in our delivery mix"", concludes the analyst. Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CEMENTIR-HOLDING-N-V-76193/news/Cementir-Holding-Q3-23-Conservative-guidance-45276971/,CEMENTIR HOLDING  :  Q3 23: Conservative guidance,"November 08, 2023 at 01:44 pm EST","Q3 23: Conservative guidance EARNINGS/SALES RELEASESCementir Holding has reported a strong set of results that exceeded our initial expectations. Despite a decrease in volume, the company maintained stable revenue due to increased average selling prices, and improved its margins through an operational cost reduction and its presence in niche markets. The company has raised its guidance, but we believe it to be on the conservative side.FACT• Revenue: €1,295m (vs €1,288m in 9M 22)
• EBITDA: €326.2m (vs €238.3m in 9M 22)
• Outlook upgraded: EBITDA now around €380m (previously €365m)ANALYSISCementir Holding has released a favorable set of 9-month results, with stable revenue and a rise in EBITDA. Despite a challenging macroeconomic landscape marked by high interest rates and elevated energy costs, which led to a decline in sales volumes, the company still achieved a robust performance. Cement volumes decreased by 3.1%, ready-mix concrete (RMC) by 10% and aggregates by 11%. However, through the effective execution of price increases, the company managed to report an impressive 37% increase in EBITDA to €326.2m, including non-recurring income of €13.5m mainly related to a gain on asset sales.
Developed countries, which account for 72% of the group’s EBITDA, were more significantly affected by the decline in volume. However, in all geographical markets, except the US, EBITDA showed an upward trend. In the Nordics, EBITDA increased by 22.6% and, in Belgium, there was a 22.4% increase, while in the US, price increases were insufficient to fully offset the volume decrease and increased variable costs. Thus, EBITDA decreased by 12.5%.
Nonetheless, sales volume in Turkey and China remained robust while Malaysia and Egypt experienced a market slowdown. Turkey’s contribution to EBITDA has steadily risen from 14% in 2022 to 18% today, driven by strong demand following the earthquakes in the country. The company has shifted its focus from cement exports, which have declined by 34%, to the more profitable domestic market. Investments in earthquake-resistant projects have boosted demand, resulting in a 32% increase in revenue. Note that the 43% devaluation of the Turkish Lira (TRY) against the Euro had an impact on the Q3 results and is expected to continue affecting the company’s results in Q4. In China, despite a 15% increase in volumes, pricing pressure due to competition offset the volume growth. As a result, the company maintained stable revenue but achieved higher EBITDA, which increased by 11.6%. In Malaysia and Egypt, although volumes declined, both regions managed to achieve EBITDA growth, with a substantial increase of 64.2% in Malaysia and 8.2% in Egypt. It is worth noting that, like Turkey, there was a significant devaluation of the Egyptian pound, amounting to a 74% decrease in value relative to the Euro.
Overall, the company’s strategy, based on geographical balance, underscored its importance as, when the construction market is declining in one region, it can remain resilient or even grow in another. The company’s impressive performance is also due to its prudent management of operational costs. Like many of its peers, Cementir Holding has demonstrated its ability to pass on the carbon price to customers, which has contributed to the management’s confidence in cost control.
Conservative forecast in 2023
Despite this robust performance, the company is adopting a cautious stance. Although Cementir has already achieved an EBITDA of €320 million in the first nine months, the management has revised its EBITDA guidance to €380 million, which is lower than our estimate of €399 million. The prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty has led the company to exercise prudence regarding the outlook for 2023. The conflict in Gaza could potentially impact the operational performance in Egypt, and this is compounded by the monetary policy being pursued in Turkey, which might affect both demand and exchange rates. The management appears to have a relatively accurate handle on forecasting in developed markets, but predicting outcomes in emerging and volatile markets remains challenging. Nonetheless, the company has effectively managed costs and improved margins throughout the year, thanks to its robust cost management. We anticipate that Cementir will maintain this efficient cost management throughout the remainder of the year.IMPACTThe company has raised its FY23 guidance and now expects EBITDA to be around €380m. Despite a robust quarter in a challenging environment, the management has adopted a cautious approach due to the uncertainties related to the devaluation of the Turkish lira and the ongoing demand slowdown in the Nordics. We have integrated the Q3 results into our model and project further growth in Turkey for Q4, factoring in the devaluation. We do not expect costs to exert extreme pressure on EBITDA in Q4. Consequently, our estimates are higher than the company’s guidance. Therefore, we reaffirm our buy recommendation on the stock.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Cementir Holding N.V.,CEM,NL0013995087,Equities,Construction Materials

Last night, Bonduelle reported a slight 0.5% drop in quarterly sales to 568.5 ME, slightly below Oddo BHF's expectations (576 ME) due to a more negative currency effect than expected. Organic growth came in at 4.2%, slightly better than expected (+3.9%). The evolution of sales and the results of the agricultural campaigns do not call into question the annual guidance, which has been confirmed. According to Oddo BHF, 'the Group should benefit from Q2 onwards (Oct-Nov-Dec, editor's note) from cost savings generated by the reorganization plan for the Florence production site in the USA, estimated at a total of nearly 10 ME'. Finally, the broker believes that the recent fall in Bonduelle's share price seems 'unjustified'. Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

On a like-for-like basis, sales rose by +3.1%.Against this backdrop, Oddo BHF this morning maintained its 'outperform' rating on Teleperformance shares, with an unchanged target price of 238 euros. The broker points out that Teleperformance's management is now targeting organic growth of around 6% excluding COVID at constant exchange rates (which is already in line with Oddo BHF's expectations), compared with between 6% and 8% in the previous estimate. However, the 2023 EBITA target remains unchanged at around 16%. The analyst considers the quarterly performance to be 'mixed', and believes that it seems to represent a low point, with Q4 likely to be a little better oriented.  Organic growth in 2024 nevertheless remains uncertain, so that the Group's revaluation should be a medium-term process"", concludes the broker, before adding that Teleperformance remains an undeniable ""Value"" profile, with a valuation of 6.7x EV/EBITA 2024.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Last night, Teleperformance reported sales of 1989 ME (-3.3% on a reported basis), slightly below expectations (Oddo was expecting 2054 ME; consensus 2056 ME). Teleperformance management is now targeting organic growth of around 6% excluding COVID at constant exchange rates (which is already in line with Oddo BHF's expectations), compared with the previous estimate of between 6 and 8%. However, the 2023 EBITA target remains unchanged at around 16%. The analyst considers the quarterly performance to be 'mixed', and believes that it seems to represent a low point, with Q4 likely to be a little better oriented.  Organic growth in 2024 nevertheless remains uncertain, so that the Group's revaluation should be a medium-term process"", concludes the broker, before adding that Teleperformance remains an undeniable ""Value"" profile, with a valuation of 6.7x EV/EBITA 2024.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

By lowering the profit targets, the focus is now increasingly on the balance sheet of the specialty chemicals group - with probably only limited free cash, analyst Chris Counihan wrote in an initial reaction on Monday. The group is now apparently recognizing this, which is why the dividend is being cut and business units are also being sold.

They ultimately slipped 2.2 percent to 67.84 euros.       Although the building materials group confirmed its recently raised profit target in the course of presenting final quarterly figures, some analysts also saw negatives. Among other things, they pointed to a decline in volume growth, particularly in Europe. In addition, acquisitions are feared, for example by the experts at Davy Research.      With a discount of more than two percent, Heidelberg Materials was the second weakest stock after Zalando on Thursday. So far this year, the share has been one of the strongest German blue chips, with a gain of just over 27 percent./ck/zb----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Heidelberg Materials AG,HEI,DE0006047004,Equities,Construction Materials

We continue to believe that Swissquote can thrive in any environment thanks to its business model where high rates act as a natural hedge to volatility and a trading activity decline.

Based on the assumption of sustainably high interest rates in 2024, higher market volatility compared to 2023 and a potential revival of the crypto market, we expect Swissquote to make good progress towards its 2025 guidance as soon as in 2024. This should be sustained in 2025 with still-higher volatility levels which should more than offset the higher costs and lower net interest income as we believe rates should decline amidst an overall softening in global monetary policy. CHANGE IN EPS2023 : CHF 15.2 vs 15.1 +0.84%2024 : CHF 18.9 vs 17.8 +6.41%We have left our 2023 EPS estimates unchanged as an increase in net interest income reflecting higher 3-month rates on the liquidity portfolio’s currencies has been offset by lower trading income, lower eforex income and higher costs, reflecting the increased headcount and higher wage inflation. 

We have however revised up our 2024 EPS estimates as we now factor in a more volatile scenario for markets leading to an increased number of transactions and higher net fee and commission income (CHF226m vs CHF179m), as well as higher crypto asset income (CHF26m vs CHF15m) as we expect a combination of bitcoin halving (April 2024), potential US ETF approval and the first-rate cuts coming from central banks as early as in the Q2-24. This will be offset by a reduction in eforex income and the trading result, on the back of slower account growth as well as higher costs, linked to higher headcount and slightly increased wage inflation. 

For 2025, we have left our 2025 EPS estimates unchanged as lower net interest income linked to lower 3-month rates on the liquidity portfolio, as well as lower trading income and lower eforex income linked to slower-than-anticipated account growth and higher operating expenses should be more than fully offset by higher net fee income linked to higher volatility levels and increased net crypto assets income on the back of the improved crypto market conditions and higher assets under custody. CHANGE IN NAVCHF 270 vs 229 +17.9%Our NAV is based on a 3-year average EV/EBITDA multiple applied to Swissquote’s EBITDA estimates. With the 2024 upgrade, this leads to a rise in our 3-year average EBITDA to which we apply a conservative 10x multiple, leading to an improvement in our NAV valuation.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Swissquote Group Holding Ltd,SQN,CH0010675863,Equities,Financial & Commodity Market Operators

The return of onepoint to the race for Atos was a more credible option following the change in the group's Chairman"", notes Oddo BHF, which nevertheless points out that onepoint should not necessarily be seen as a white knight or even less as a good Samaritan in this operation.  Beyond the possible short-term short-squeeze linked to this announcement, we still see a pre-money fair value of E6.0 per share, or E4.7 after dilution of the capital increase.

With a recent gain of 5.6 percent to 8.71 euros, they have now rallied 36 percent in just one week. A week ago, they had lost more than 35 percent in one fell swoop. Investors were irritated because the company had asked the German government for guarantees worth billions to secure the recent sharp rise in orders, especially in the power engineering business.       In addition, Siemens Energy continues to have problems in its wind power business. Most of the currently executed offshore wind power projects are not profitable, analyst Akash Gupta of JPMorgan now wrote in a commentary on the Orsted disappointment signals for the industry. To unwind some of them - with old contracts still from the time before the Ukraine war - is therefore not the worst thing.

On Tradegate, the shares last lost 1.1 to the Xetra close to 22.02 euros in pre-borsday trading, which, however, stemmed their previously more significant minus.      The continuing weak demand for clothing is again forcing the company to adjust its annual targets. As a result, sales and gross merchandise volume, key indicators for the industry, are likely to be worse than previously expected for the current year.      According to analysts at Goldman Sachs, however, there should be no change to the market estimates for operating profit (Ebit) for the full year.
