While the Group has raised its forecasts for the year, the analyst believes that operating income should be boosted by ""at least a quarter"" thanks to the quality of sales (volume/price/mix) and a less unfavorable cost base (raw materials/transportation/energy/supplier remuneration). As a result, 'Renault's profitability could reach new heights in 2023, surpassing the previous record set in... 1999 (before the Nissan era)', argues Stifel.Le Losange now anticipates: (1) a Group margin of between 7% and 8% (compared with 6% or more previously) and (2) automotive operating FCF of over E2.5 billion (compared with over E2 billion previously).According to Stifel, given the pace of product launches in 2024 (14 new cars) and 2025 (five new cars), as well as work on costs, 'forward financial statements could prove even more attractive than in 2023'.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

He justified the new price target by citing his updated forecasts and shifting the valuation horizon into the future./edh/tih  Publication of the original study: 29.06.2023 / 19:47 / BST First disclosure of the original study: 30.06.2023 / 00:25 / BST----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Siemens AG,SIE,DE0007236101,Equities,Electrical Components & Equipment

The Stoxx Europe 600 Real Estate sector index rebounded from its low since October 2022, but is still down nearly 12 percent in 2023.      It continues to suffer from the interest rate hike cycle to combat high inflation and falling real estate valuations. Only the commodities sector, which is particularly sensitive to the economy, has been weaker this year.      However, sentiment was somewhat improved on the last trading day in June by news from LEG Immobilien. The Düsseldorf-based company had raised its forecasts for 2023 the previous evening. In particular, the now higher expected rental growth was welcomed by the market.      The shares of LEG gained up to 7.5 percent and thus curbed their half-year loss to 11 percent. Vonovia also made clear gains in the Dax, but remains the second-weakest stock in the leading index in the first half of the year, down 19 percent. In the SDax, Patrizia was the best performer on Friday, gaining around four and a half percent./ag/ajx/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Vonovia SE,VNA,DE000A1ML7J1,Equities,Real Estate Development & Operations

The analyst reports that the figures presented yesterday by Casino in its slideshow reflect the effect of a marked drop in prices since the beginning of March, without compensating for this with an equally marked increase in customer traffic and purchases. The Group expects positive sales growth in Q4 2023 for supermarkets and by H1 2024 for hypermarkets. In this context, EBITDA 2023 after rent is expected at 439 ME (Oddo BHF had forecast 775 ME in its model) and EBITDA 2024 after rent is expected at 656 ME.'All the details of the restructuring have not been finalized, but whatever the scenario, the central assumption is that of massive dilution of current shareholders.

After the withdrawal of annual targets late Thursday evening, the shares of the power engineering group have since fallen by a total of more than 40 percent. At less than 14 euros, they hit another low since November 2022.       ""The predictability is too poor,"" was how Vivek Midha from Citigroup justified the withdrawal of his previous buy recommendation. The assessment of the situation at the problem child, the Spanish subsidiary Siemens Gamesa, had changed fundamentally compared to his ""Buy"" rating in May, Midha said. Siemens Energy had reported on Thursday significantly increased failure rates for wind turbine components and that planned improvements in productivity are not materializing to the extent previously expected.       Midha currently sees an enormously wide corridor between the optimal case and the worst case: if Siemens Energy were to really get to grips with the credibility problem, the shares could more than double very quickly, the expert says. He then puts a fair value of 34 euros in prospect. However, if the problems continue to make waves, he even considers a low of 11 euros to be possible.      The experts at Jefferies and DZ Bank also lowered their thumbs at the start of the week and lifted their recommendations./ag/ajx/nas",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Siemens Energy AG,ENR,DE000ENER6Y0,Equities,Renewable Energy Equipment & Services

It is characterized by high Corona-era comparables, high inflation and weak consumer spending, she added. On the other hand, rationalization is helping profitability, she added. With the weak share price performance since the beginning of the year, she believes the uncertainties are priced in. However, the market now wants to see growth first and further industry consolidation. At Hellofresh, she praises the opportunities, but criticizes the high churn rates. Thus one needs further high marketing expenditures./ag/zb  Publication of the original study: 22.06.2023 / 01:09 / CEST First disclosure of original study: Date not specified in study / Time not specified in study / Time zone not specified in study",© dpa-AFX - 2023,HelloFresh SE,HFG,DE000A161408,Equities,Food Retail & Distribution

ACTION2023 is shaping up particularly well for IDI, which, after selling Freeland in March, is preparing to sell its stake in Flex Composite Group to Michelin for a total EV of €700m. The move should not only replenish IDI’s pockets, but it also demonstrates IDI’s ability to create value, with a return on investment of over 12x.FACT
IDI made its first investment in Flex Composite Group for €23.2m back in 2015. 
IDI and Andera Partners have announced an agreement to sell the entire Flex Composite Group to Michelin for an enterprise value of €700m. 
This amount corresponds to an investment multiple 12x higher than the initial investment. ANALYSISIDI kicked off 2023 on the right foot in terms of investments and divestments. Indeed, as of mid-2023, IDI had already completed four deals: the external growth of Talis Education into the Fore group and two disposals, including that of Freeland, the French leader in services to the self-employed, to MML Capital, enabling IDI to achieve a solid investment multiple of 2.2x and an IRR of c. 24% in less than four years. It is worth noting, however, that Freeland’s story is a little different, as IDI reinvested a significant part of the proceeds from the sale.
This morning, IDI announced that it is now the turn of Flex Composite Group to leave its portfolio. IDI and Andera Partners have signed an agreement to sell the entire Flex Composite Group (FCG) to Michelin for an enterprise value of €700m. This transaction would correspond to a substantial return on investment of 12x the initial outlay. As a reminder, FCG joined the IDI portfolio in 2015 for €23.2m. As of December 2022, IDI held 63.4% of the group alongside Andera Partners as minority investor.
Flex Composite Group is a European leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of advanced composite materials. The Group is now made up of three divisions: i) Engineered fabrics, the technical coated fabrics division, ii) Carbon fabrics and technical composites Composite Materials, and iii) a thermoplastic films division, Technical Films, all of which have enabled it to achieve sales of c.€200m in 2022. Starting in 2015 up to 2022, through IDI’s support of its development, FCG has generated an operating margin of between 25% and 30% and average organic growth of 11%.
The transaction is set to close in Q3 23, subject to approval by the competition authorities, and is further proof of IDI’s ability to create value.",© Alphavalue - 2023,IDI,IDIP,FR0000051393,Equities,Investment Management & Fund Operators

At broker Lang & Schwarz, the Dax-listed shares lost a good twelve percent to 312 euros ahead of schedule. This means that the price gains achieved in June have been eroded.       This month, the shares had recovered by 15 percent to their high before the weekend, breaking the downward trend they had been on since February. Now, however, they are falling back sharply and in Xetra trading, at the current pre-Borussia discount, would be thrown back to the low for the year at the end of May.      Sartorius had issued a nasty sales and profit warning, a trader explained in the morning. Even if the warning is not completely unexpected, the share price is likely to come under heavy pressure.      Analyst Odysseas Manesiotis of Berenberg Bank had also feared a reduction in the annual targets, but it is now much stronger than expected. In discussions with management, it had become clear that there would be no improvement in the second quarter, and that the second half of the year would probably be the same as the first. According to Manesiotis, the market will only trust the medium-term confidence when the growth in orders is also reflected in the figures.       UBS criticized that in the conference call on the first quarter, management had still asserted that despite a weak performance, the full year would go according to plan.

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORPHOSYS-AG-436425/news/JPMorgan-sees-high-potential-in-Morphosys-44131497/,JPMorgan sees high potential in Morphosys,"June 16, 2023 at 08:35 am EDT","NEW YORK (dpa-AFX) - U.S. bank JPMorgan is giving antibody specialist Morphosys plenty of advance praise months before the crucial data readout on its cancer drug pelabresib. More likely than failure is that the trial will be a success, industry expert James Gordon wrote in a report available Friday. But even with a 50/50 chance, the share, which is currently heading for 30 euros, still has an upside potential of around 40 percent. The expert therefore raised his rating by two notches from ""Underweight"" to ""Overweight"" and tripled the price target to 36 euros.      Morphosys had recently accelerated its work on pelabresib, the decisive data are now announced for the end of 2023. The drug is being tested in patients with myelofibrosis. Many experts refer to this rare disease as bone marrow cancer, but the experts at Morphosys see the causes in the blood. If the company achieves a breakthrough with the drug, many experts believe it has blockbuster potential - in other words, the chance to generate sales of at least a billion dollars a year.      Morphosys had brought pelabresib under its own roof in 2021 through the costly acquisition of the U.S. company Constellation Pharmaceuticals and has since put all its eggs in this basket. However, many experts, and now JPMorgan analyst Gordon, see a high chance that Morphosys can achieve its key goals of reducing spleen enlargement caused by the disease - as well as reducing symptoms. Such success would remove a lot of risk from the stock, the industry expert noted.      In the process, Gordon even credits the drug with a peak sales potential of $1.5 billion annually - which he believes would transform the small Morphosys company. After all, in 2022, for example, the Bavarians were still turning over just under 300 million euros. With the U.S. group Abbvie, according to the expert, a competitor in myelofibrosis could appear on the scene in the future, but according to the data to date, the drug of the Americans appears less tolerable and has a worse safety profile than Pelabresib.      JPMorgan had downgraded Morphosys shares to ""underweight"" from previously ""neutral"" at the start of the year. At the time, Gordon felt that the move was prompted primarily by the disappointing sales performance of Morphosysa's blood cancer drug Monjuvi, which also carried the risk of falling market expectations. However, this problem has now been amply overcome, the analyst judged.      According to the ""Overweight"" rating, JPMorgan expects the stock to outperform the respective sector in the next six to twelve months./tav/ag/jha/  Analyzing institute JPMorgan.

This is mainly driven by continued interest rate hikes across Switzerland, the EU and the US. 
This incremental net interest income flows through the P&L with very few underlying costs. As a result, although we have slightly increased the cost base given Swissquote's tendency to leverage on highly profitable years to expand further, our pre-tax profit margin forecast increases from 48.5% and 49.9% for FY 23 and FY 24 to 49.7% and 51.1% for FY 23 and FY 24, respectively.CHANGE IN DCFCHF 250 vs 205 +22.1%As described in our EPS section, the DCF upgrade is driven by, overall a much stronger top line (from CHF486m and CHF557m for FY 23 and FY 24 to CHF541.5m and CHF618.8m for FY 22 and FY 24, respectively) while keeping a very stable cost base.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Swissquote Group Holding Ltd,SQN,CH0010675863,Equities,Financial & Commodity Market Operators

European fashion and accessories retailers are in a state of flux as buying behavior changes, analyst William Woods wrote in an industry report Wednesday evening. However, he added, there is no apocalypse. Return on investment is strong in absolute terms and also compared with other consumer sectors, he said, although it has come under pressure in the past five years. Looking for sustainable growth, Woods identifies Primark group AB Foods and Inditex as outperformers. In the case of Zalando, meanwhile, he does not expect it to achieve its long-term goals and considers the shares expensive./ag/ajx  Publication of the original study: 14.06.2023 / 12:53 / UTC First disclosure of the original study: 14.06.2023 / 15:35 / UTC----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Zalando SE,ZAL,DE000ZAL1111,Equities,Internet Services

In this context, the exclusive partnership with Novozymes for the sale of enzymes, the partnership with world PET leader Indorama for the Longlaville plant, the receipt of government subsidies and the new strategic plan based on a premium licensing model mean that growth can be expected to accelerate over the next few years.

  S&P Global Ratings on Monday said it downgraded Nasdaq's long-term issuer credit ratings and senior unsecured notes to BBB from BBB+. 

  The ratings agency said the downgrade is a result of Nasdaq's planned acquisition of Adenza, which provides capital markets and regulatory solutions to financial institutions, for $10.5 billion and transaction costs, including $5.75 billion in cash and the remainder in common equity. 

  S&P said it expects the Adenza transaction to close within six to nine months and for Nasdaq to raise about $5.9 billion of new debt to fund the acquisition. The financing for the acquisition would weaken Nasdaq's financial risk profile, S&P said. 

  ""Nasdaq's funds from operations to debt will drop well below 23% in the next two years, materially weaker than our previous base case, which did not consider the Adenza acquisition,"" S&P said.

Therefore, analyst Wolfgang Specht downgraded the paper of the software provider specialized in medical practices and hospitals from ""Buy"" to ""Hold"". The price target was left at 56 euros. In view of the price loss on this day, which according to traders is mainly a reaction to the Berenberg study, this currently means, however, again a potential of about 22 percent for the share.

The expert believes the company's annual targets are achievable and left his estimates for 2023 and 2024 unchanged. However, Specht believes it will be difficult to achieve profitability (adjusted Ebitda margin) of 27 percent by 2025 due to the necessary investments and the continued need for qualified personnel.

CEO Oliver Blume will present the plan to the Supervisory Board on Tuesday, it said. In the brand group for the mass market, earnings are to be increased by around three billion euros annually, thanks among other things to efficient development work and higher capacity utilization.      In the article, analyst Schwarz highlighted profitability targets for individual divisions that were significantly above expectations. He said this applied to the Audi margin range, which at 12 to 14 percent was higher than the previous range of 9 to 11 percent. For the core VW brand, 6.5 percent is planned instead of the more than 6 percent previously mentioned, he added./tih/mis",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Volkswagen AG,VOW3,DE0007664039,Equities,Auto & Truck Manufacturers

Possible cost reductions are also not yet factored into market estimates, he added. The annual general meeting at the end of June should be accompanied by a stabilization of the company's management and better strategic predictability. A possible merger with Sky Deutschland would also mean significant value potential./ajx/ck      Publication of the original study: 12.06.2023 / 07:57 / CEST  First disclosure of the original study: 12.06.2023 / 08:04 / CEST----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE,PSM,DE000PSM7770,Equities,Broadcasting

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/HUGO-BOSS-AG-10800354/news/Hugo-Boss-back-in-fashion-UBS-starts-with-a-buy-rating-44058152/,Hugo Boss 'back in fashion' - UBS starts with a 'buy' rating,"June 07, 2023 at 06:01 am EDT","ZURICH (dpa-AFX) - The turnaround at fashion manufacturer Hugo Boss has only just begun in the view of major Swiss bank UBS. The fashion manufacturer's margin potential is still underestimated, it said, adding that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. ""Hugo Boss is back in fashion,"" Susy Tibaldi wrote in a research note available Wednesday. The analyst attributes this in part to an effective social media campaign over the past year and a half that has made Hugo Boss more relevant among its young target audience.      On the popular platform TikTok alone, the fashion manufacturer has gained more followers than its three subsequent competitors combined. Tibaldi also praises the focus on more casual wear as well as women's fashion, which has given Hugo Boss more reach. This, he said, was also accompanied by a remodeling of stores. As a result, sales picked up more than expected - and that was in only the second year of the brand's relaunch.      UBS therefore includes Hugo Boss in its valuation with ""Buy"" and issues a price target of 87 euros. With this target, Tibaldi trusts the MDax-listed stock to return to the level of 2015. At that time, the stock had reached its record high of 120.40 euros, before collapsing to one-sixth of that value by March 2020. On Wednesday morning, the share rose strongly in the direction of 68 euros.      Compared to its peers, Hugo Boss shares are undervalued, Tibaldi wrote. Despite above-average growth in earnings per share, the discount to the rest of the industry is around 20 percent.       The fashion manufacturer's margin potential, in particular, is underestimated and could open up a whole new chapter. This is because freight costs have now normalized, while Hugo Boss has raised the prices of its own products. According to Tibaldi, this should more than compensate for the ongoing investments in brand and digitization in the future.      Tibaldi is also betting on the upcoming Capital Markets Day on June 15, which could become a potential price driver for Hugo Boss shares. The fashion manufacturer could raise its targets beyond current expectations. In doing so, the UBS analyst has faith in the group's brand momentum, even in the face of macroeconomic headwinds and tepid consumer sentiment, which, however, poses a risk to her optimistic forecast.      With a ""buy"" rating, UBS expects the stock's total return (share price gain plus dividend) to exceed the market's expected return by at least six percent over the next twelve months./niw/ag/mis      Analyzing institute UBS.

With the new target, analyst Wolfgang Specht took into account the high of Octapharma's voluntary takeover bid for SNP in a study presented on Tuesday. Its main reason is likely to be the personal interests of Octapharma owner and SNP major shareholder Wolfgang Marguerre. The dispute between Marguerre and the SNP board is likely to continue. With a qualified majority in SNP, Marguerre could make far-reaching decisions, although his interest in a majority of more than two-thirds could be limited, Specht believes. The operating environment is likely to remain mixed, and valuations are not cheap, he says.

The market for commercial real estate is in a downturn, investor demand is weakening and prices are falling, wrote analyst Borja Ramirez Segura according to a study available on Tuesday.      As a result, he is now more cautious than the average analyst on the real estate financier's loan loss provisions item. He downgraded the shares listed in the SDax, the index of smaller stocks, from ""neutral"" to ""sell."" He cut the price target from 8.60 to 6.10 euros, which means he sees further downside potential of more than ten percent.      In his base scenario, Ramirez Segura expects commercial property prices to fall by an average of 20 to 30 percent in the current and coming year. In a vulnerability analysis he has prepared, this would mean additional loan loss provisions of around EUR 100 million, which he expects to be split in half between 2023 and 2024.      He therefore lowered his estimates for the specialty bank's earnings per share. His forecasts are now ten percent below the market estimate. Looking at the hard core capital ratio, which stood at 16.6 percent at the end of the first quarter, the bank is in a ""solid position"" despite everything, he said.      With a ""sell"" rating, Citigroup predicts a negative total return for the stock over the next twelve months./ajx/ck/jha/  Analyzing institute Citigroup.

On the trading platform Tradegate, they fell compared to the Xetra closing price of the previous day last by 2.1 percent to 7.15 euros.       Citigroup analyst Borja Ramirez Segura downgraded the papers of the real estate financier from ""Neutral"" to ""Sell"" and lowered the price target from 8.60 to 6.10 euros. He justified this by pointing out that the commercial real estate markets are in a downturn with falling prices and declining investor demand.

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/HEIDELBERG-MATERIALS-AG-436181/news/Cleaner-targets-JPMorgan-upgrades-Heidelberg-Materials-44010993/,Cleaner targets - JPMorgan upgrades Heidelberg Materials,"June 01, 2023 at 05:51 am EDT","NEW YORK (dpa-AFX) - The European building materials industry is getting cleaner, according to US bank JPMorgan. The companies' decarbonization targets led to the industry's fundamentals improving, subsequently resulting in stronger pricing power. JPMorgan analyst Elodie Rall wrote this in an industry report released Thursday, upgrading Heidelberg Materials to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"" - with a price target raised to 80 euros from 66 euros.      According to Rall, Heidelberg Materials has the most ambitious decarbonization targets in the industry. As a result, the group will ultimately be able to produce cleaner cement products and will then be able to demand almost three times the current cement price in the trade.      In the short term, there are question marks regarding sustainable pricing and declining volumes until 2024, so Rall refrains from issuing an ""overweight"" recommendation for the sector as a whole. However, she sees the greatest opportunities for Heidelberger.      The expert raised her operating earnings estimates for the DAX-listed group for this year. Her forecast for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is now ten percent above the upper end of the target range formulated by the company.      The Heidelberg Materials share is also attractive from a valuation point of view. The stock is currently trading at a 25 percent discount to its long-term average compared with the European cement sector, which is trading at a 17 percent discount.      According to its ""Overweight"" rating, JPMorgan expects the share to outperform the respective sector over the next six to twelve months./ajx/tih/jha/  Analyzing institute JPMorgan.

As for the outlook for 2023/24, Nacon is not disclosing any guidance at this stage, but confirms its line-up of some twenty games, compared with 13 a year earlier.Nacon is, however, sidestepping the failure of the Gollum release (last May 25). According to the analyst, the 'bad buzz' surrounding this game, developed by Deadelic, is clearly detrimental to sales in the short term, with an impact of around 5% on EPS, but it 'does not call into question the prospect of a marked rebound in results this year', After a financial year 2022/23 far from the Group's initial objectives, the bad buzz about Gollum is not likely to reassure in a context that remains delicate in the sector, and the share's reaction over one week attests to this (-21%)"", analyzes Oddo BHF.  However, despite the failure of Gollum, which we are taking into account in our new forecasts, the line-up looks set to be fairly dynamic over the next few months, with content that seems to us to be of much higher quality"", concludes the broker.

We now estimate sales for 2023 at €788m versus €831m previously, and the underlying operating profit at 6.1% versus 7.2%. This decline is due to a downward revision in the sales and margins at Chargeurs Advanced Materials, on which we had been overly optimistic after an exceptionally high level in Q1-22 due to a post-Covid catch-up effect. We had also been too optimistic on Chargeurs Luxury Materials, with a sales growth forecast of 7%, despite the particularly high level of activity in 2022. We have also reduced our estimates for the HealthCare Solution division (with sales growth of 0% vs. 30% previously), as we no longer have any visibility on the division's revenues and margins in the context of an improving healthcare situation. For 2025, however, we are more optimistic, estimating strong sales growth for Chargeurs Museum Studio (+25%) to over €200m with a margin of 12%, 10% for Chargeurs Luxury Materials to €110m with a margin of c.4% and 50% for Chargeurs Personal Goods to c.€24m with a margin of 10%.CHANGE IN NAV€ 41.1 vs 38.0 +7.98%Our NAV has increased on the back of updated EV/EBITDA multiples and peer groups. We now use average estimated EBITDA for 23/24 and 25. As a result, Chargeurs Advanced Materials has seen its value drop significantly, with a multiple of 11.5x versus 14.5x previously, while Chargeurs Fashion Technologies' value has risen sharply due to a change in methodology, from an EV/EBITDA of 9x to an EV/EBITDA of 11.6x. Finally, we have applied an EV/EBITDA of 11.4x for Chargeurs Museum Studio, compared with 10.5x previously.CHANGE IN DCF€ 26.2 vs 28.7 -8.57%Our DCF-based valuation is reduced slightly from €28.76 to €26.20 after incorporating our adjustment to the FY23-24 EPS forecast (see EPS commentary). We expect revenues of around €788m (vs. €831m) for FY 2023 with an underlying profit of c.€34m (vs.€51m) and €872m (vs. €892m) for FY2024 with an underlying operating profit of €53m (vs. €67m). We are also less optimistic on the WCR, which we had underestimated due to the extremely low level in 2021 (3.8% of sales).",© Alphavalue - 2023,Chargeurs,CRI,FR0000130692,Equities,Consumer Goods Conglomerates

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CHARGEURS-5218/news/Chargeurs-Heading-for-a-Chargeurs-Advanced-Materials-rebound-43943021/,CHARGEURS  :  Heading for a Chargeurs Advanced Materials rebound?,"May 25, 2023 at 02:42 am EDT","Heading for a Chargeurs Advanced Materials rebound? EARNINGS/SALES RELEASESDespite Chargeurs’ somewhat expected 18% lfl yoy revenue contraction in Q1 ‘23 due to the record 2022 Q1, Chargeurs Advanced Materials showed signs of a volume recovery with 21% qoq volume growth. This business line is responding to the wait-and-see attitude in particular in China by expanding geographically and premiumizing. The Q1-23 confirmed the Group’s new growth drivers, with Chargeurs PCC Fashion Technologies’ business holding at high levels and Chargeurs Museum Studio posting a solid 30.2% lfl yoy growth. Following these results, Chargeurs confirmed its scenario of positive trends in the H2 23.FACT
Chargeurs reported total revenue of €169.7m in Q1-23, down 16.6% yoy (18% organically). Over the quarter, revenues were down slightly by 2% but grew organically by 0.6%.
The decline in sales compared with Q1-22 was attributable to Chargeurs Advanced Materials (-27% organic growth yoy to €70.7m) due to an unfavorable basis of comparison with a post-Covid catch-up effect. CAM’s revenues, however, highlighted an inflection point with a positive volume effect of 21% over the quarter and revenue growth of 8.6% on a quarterly basis. 
Although down by 6% yoy, the Fashion Technologies business line maintained high levels at €51.3m (-0.2% organically). 
In the Luxury division, Chargeurs Museum Studio activity continued to expand, with organic growth of 30.2% yoy to €24m. 
Lastly, Chargeurs Luxury Fibers was down 30% yoy on an organic basis to €21.7m but up 17.3% qoq.Revenue break-down by divisionANALYSISChargeurs posted a revenue down 16.6% yoy or 18% organically to €169.7m.  The Group’s business was weighed down by Advanced Materials and Luxury Fibers , which had a record base of comparison. On a quarterly basis, however, Chargeurs posted organic growth of 0.6%, boosted by these same businesses. 
An inflection point for Advanced Materials?
Despite a 27% organic decline in sales yoy to €70.7m, Chargeurs Advanced Materials (CAM) recorded qoq growth of 8.6%. The Q1-22 comparison was unfavorable, as it had benefited from the strong demand driven by post-Covid inventory rebuilding. While volumes have naturally declined over the last three quarters on the back of inventory normalization and customer de-stocking, the 21% volume increase experienced in Q1-23 suggests that this process has now bottomed out. Although the prospects for a recovery in China have yet to be confirmed, the division has been able to recover by diversifying geographically, notably in India and Australia, and by extending its offering to the premium segment. Based on these results, Chargeurs confirmed its forecast for a rebound in CAM’s business in H2-23. 
Chargeurs PCC Fashion Technologies holds its own in today’s challenging environment
Chargeurs PCC Fashion Technologies held its own in Q1 23 with a slight organic decline of 0.2% yoy to €51.3m. This performance was underpinned by the business line’s pricing power and a volume effect resulting from diversification, along with market share gains, despite a lagging recovery in Asia. Europe and South America continue to lead the way, and the Group remains optimistic barring a collapse in global consumption. 
Chargeurs Museum Studio affirms its status as the new growth driver
Chargeurs Museum Studio confirmed its momentum with a 30.2% organic increase in revenue to €24m. Going forward, the division is maintaining its target of €120m in revenues by 2023. Chargeurs reaffirmed its outlook for higher margins in H2 23/24 and 24/25 due to the phasing of large projects won in 2021 and 2022. The growth outlook remains good for the business line, which is currently in discussions in India and Central Asia to round out its exposure in Europe and North America.
Solid quarterly momentum for Chargeurs Luxury Fibers
Despite a 30% organic decline in revenue to €21.7m, Chargeurs Luxury Fibers (CLF) got the year off to a good start with growth of 17.3% qoq and the healthy dynamic for its premium wool label, NATIVA. Looking ahead, CLF aims to position itself as the market leader in eco-fibers (currently wool and, in the coming months, cashmere and cotton) and intends to expand its partnerships, as it did with Gucci at the end of 2022.
Outlook for the coming years
While no new information was provided, Chargeurs confirmed its ambition to make a major acquisition in the Luxury division in 2023 to rebalance the revenue contributions of its Technologies and Luxury businesses. Chargeurs reiterated its outlook for a strong 2023 and revenues of more than €1bn with EBIT of €100m excluding acquisitions by 2025.IMPACTOur model is currently being revised to incorporate these results. We will adjust downward our revenue and margin estimates for FY23-24 because we were overly optimistic.

From a purely operational point of view, we still consider that improvement at Elior will be slower than its competitors, even with the integration of DMS, with a relatively high integration risk in the short term', he asserts.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

The analyst reports that on Friday after trading, OSE Immuno announced that it had regained the rights to OSE-127 after Servier decided not to pursue development of this asset following the failure of Phase IIa in Sjögren's syndrome.' As a reminder, in 2016, the two groups had entered into a collaboration to address autoimmune diseases with OSE-127 as part of 2 clinical trials conducted in parallel. Servier had placed a license option on OSE-127, which it therefore decided not to exercise, thereby cancelling out the potential for an associated milestone of 15mE ', the analyst points out.

The analyst reports that on Friday after trading, OSE Immuno announced that it had regained the rights to OSE-127 after Servier decided not to pursue development of this asset following the failure of phase IIa in Sjögren's syndrome.'As a reminder, in 2016, the two groups had entered into a collaboration to address autoimmune diseases with OSE-127 as part of 2 clinical trials conducted in parallel. Servier had placed a license option on OSE-127, which it has therefore decided not to exercise, thereby cancelling out the potential for an associated milestone of 15mE', says the analyst.

In the afternoon, the securities of the electronics retailer lost 12.3 percent to 2.286 euros, which means that the strong recovery gain since the beginning of the year has melted down to around 23 percent. The papers also sank below not only the 21-day line, which indicates the short-term trend, but also below the supports signaling the medium-term trend.      Analyst Volker Bosse of Baader Bank commented on the sharp price losses: ""The market probably expected more after the nearly six percent price gain on Friday."" Investors were probably worried about management's comments on consumer sentiment and the challenging environment, even though CEO Karsten Wildberger had expressed confidence about the start to the second half of the year.      In his study on the stock, Bosse had expressed an overall positive view after the figures. With regard to the stationary business, he pointed out that Ceconomy had continued to recover from the pandemic. Adjusted operating profit had exceeded expectations, with improvements in Germany, but also in Turkey, offsetting the difficult market environment in Spain and Italy./ck/ngu",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Ceconomy AG,CEC,DE0007257503,Equities,Computer & Electronics Retailers

After a weaker start at 19.10 euros, the papers of the battery manufacturer turned slightly upward to 19.57 euros by midday. It remains an annual loss of 13 percent, after they had already slumped by 80 percent in the previous year.      On the high of the low targets, the group has closed the first quarter, said analyst Philipp Konig of Goldman Sachs. In the CoinPower division, with its lithium-ion button cells for wireless headsets, for example, there was no recovery in sight, he said. Apple, the main customer, has cut back demand significantly, he said. Varta is trying to counteract this with reduced capacities and, in the short term, also with short-time work, in order to keep costs in check./ag/jha/",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Varta AG,VAR1,DE000A0TGJ55,Equities,Electrical Components & Equipment

In a study presented on Friday, DZ Bank analyst Axel Herlinghaus raised his estimates for net sales, unadjusted earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) and earnings per share for the fiscal year slightly and consequently also the fair value. He said the bourse had recently largely ignored the company's compelling performance. He attributed this to the fact that the capital market is currently reviewing its fundamental assessment of agricultural stocks after the ""premium year 2022."" ""However, as we still see the agricultural set-up clearly intact, the share remains a (long-term) buy for us.""/edh/zb  Publication of the original study: 12.05.2023 / 15:24 / CEST.

However, this is important against the background of increased interest rates, wrote analyst Jochen Schmitt in a study available on Friday.      He therefore lowered his investment rating for the stock from ""buy"" to ""hold."" Looking at his new price target of 7.60 euros, he still sees room for improvement compared to the current share price of 6.35 euros, but he still cut it by almost 40 percent. Previously, the target had been 12.00 euros.      Dic Asset will have a hard time reducing its leverage ratio LTV - as targeted for this year - to below 50 percent, he wrote. While Dic did manage to reduce its LTV in March from 57.8 percent at the end of December to 57.3 percent now, he said, this was only due to the sale of a larger property.      Even if the ratio is likely to fall by a further two percentage points in the current second quarter due to the placement of own properties into a fund, Schmitt sees little chance of this happening. Rather, a slight decline in portfolio value due to falling property prices is likely to counteract this. His own estimate for Dic's LTV is around 52.5 percent for December.      Moreover, the current environment for disposals remains difficult and, all things considered, Dic Asset has now become ""too dependent on market conditions"" to meet its LTV target, he added.      Rated ""Hold,"" Bankhaus Metzler expects the company's share price to remain broadly stable over the next 12 months./ck/tih/mis  Analyzing institute Metzler Capital Markets.

On the Tradegate trading platform, it went up by just over one percent to 25.48 euros compared to the Xetra close the previous day.       One trader praised the fact that the Bonn-based group's report was consistently better than expected, thanks in part to its German business. The fact that business in the domestic market was better than forecast was also highlighted positively by JPMorgan analyst Akhil Dattani.      The slightly raised outlook, on the other hand, should not come as a major surprise, the trader said, as it reflected the raised annual targets of U.S. subsidiary T-Mobile US. All in all, according to him, the quarterly report now has the potential to help the stock out of its correction mode.       The stock has been in correction mode since the beginning of April, after reaching its highest level since the summer of 2001 on April 5 at just over EUR 23./ck/stk----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Deutsche Telekom AG,DTE,DE0005557508,Equities,Integrated Telecommunications Services

Despite a decline in volume, the company managed to increase revenue in most segments due to higher average selling prices, while maintaining its margins thanks to its hedging policy and a presence in niche markets. EBITDA increased by 41% and the margin increased by 290bps.
The results and guidance for FY23 are in line with our expectations so we won’t be making significant changes to our model.FACT*Revenue: €414.8m (vs €362.3m in Q1 22)
*EBITDA: €81.2m (vs €60.7m in Q1 22)
*PBT: €63.9m (vs €42.4m in Q1 22)
*Outlook for the full year re-iteratedANALYSISCementir Holding has reported a good set of Q1 results, with a significant increase in revenue and EBITDA. Despite a decrease in volumes of cement, RMC and aggregates, the company managed to achieve a 14.5% increase in revenue and a 33.8% increase in EBITDA due to its successful implementation of price increases.
The higher EBITDA was primarily seen in key markets such as the Nordics and Baltics, as well as Belgium, which together accounted for 73% of the group’s EBITDA. This was due to the company’s careful management of energy costs, supported by a strong hedging policy. As a result, Cementir Holding reported an increase of 290 bps.
While energy costs have reached their peak in the last year, they have now stabilized at a level that is still higher than the average for the previous years. Consequently, we anticipate that prices will drop following the decline in energy costs. However, it is important to note that inflation might cause labor and financial costs to continue to rise this year.
Performance by division
The Nordic and Baltic region, which accounted for 40% of the total revenue, saw flat growth of 1.3% as a slight fall in volume was offset by price increases. Denmark experienced a mid-single digit drop in volumes, while Norway and Sweden both saw double-digit decreases in volume, driven by high inflation and increased interest rates affecting the residential sector and investments in public works. Despite these challenges, revenue in Denmark increased by 13.2% and EBITDA by 62%, while Norway and Sweden were more affected, with revenue decreasing by 20% and EBITDA by 84% YoY. Nevertheless, the margin still increased by 74 bps.
The Belgium and France segment posted a robust performance, with a 19% increase in revenue and a 33% increase in EBITDA, despite a decline in volume. This was mainly due to successful price increases that offset the volume decline. The EBITDA margin also saw a significant increase of 240 bps, thanks to the company’s efficient management of energy costs.
In North America, the US market experienced lower demand for volume in Texas and California due to competitive pressure from imports. Despite this, revenue increased by 2.7% thanks to price increases and a positive FX impact of 4.4%. However, EBITDA decreased by 18% due to higher operating costs, resulting in a decrease of 320 bps in the EBITDA margin.
In the Asia Pacific region, Cementir Holding experienced mixed results. In China, there was a 6% decline in revenue due to lower prices, despite a 3% increase in volumes, resulting in a 31% drop in EBITDA due to increased production costs. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, revenue decreased by 3.4% due to a significant decrease in exports, which was offset by positive demand in the local market. EBITDA increased by 19.5% due to higher selling prices and lower freight costs, which compensated for lower volumes and increased production costs.
Despite a decrease in export volume from Turkey, the company managed to achieve an impressive 82% increase in sales. This growth was driven by successful price increases and an increase in demand in the domestic market. EBITDA also saw a significant improvement, standing at €7.8m compared to €1.6m previously, resulting in a 640bp increase in the EBITDA margin.
In Egypt, revenue decreased by 12.8% primarily due to the negative impact of FX (79%). However, EBITDA increased by 34% due to the efficient management of production costs and an increase in selling prices, resulting in a 940bp increase in the margin.IMPACTDespite a very strong quarter, the management has taken a conservative stance due to uncertainty around the potential risks associated with upcoming elections in Turkey and a slowdown in demand in the Nordics. Nonetheless, it has confirmed its full-year revenue guidance of over €1.8bn, EBITDA in the range of €335-345m and a net cash position of ~€200m. We too have a similar view and, hence, we will stick to our current estimates with no upward revisions to our numbers.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Cementir Holding N.V.,CEM,NL0013995087,Equities,Construction Materials

Over the past decade, Borsen operators have expanded their activities and become diversified service providers for the needs of customers in the financial markets, analyst Oliver Carruthers wrote in an industry report available Tuesday. This has resulted in an increasing shift from volume-based cyclical revenues to more stable, recurring revenues, he added. The London Stock Exchange (LSE), which remains rated ""Buy,"" is best positioned in this regard, he said. In contrast, the more volume-dependent competitors Deutsche Borse and Euronext, which are included in the rating at ""Neutral"", are likely to struggle with declining volumes over the course of the year. In addition, the Frankfurt-based companies have already priced in the medium-term growth prospects from their own resources./gl/ag      Publication of the original study: 09.05.2023 / 03:42 / BST First disclosure of the original study: Date in study not specified / Time in study not specified / Time zone in study not specified----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Deutsche Börse AG,DB1,DE0005810055,Equities,Financial & Commodity Market Operators

In particular, the papers of the hospital operator and medical manufacturer Fresenius went up. The shares rose by 6.4 percent to 27.06 euros, topping the slightly weakening Dax index and reaching their highest level since February.      The shares of the dialysis provider from the MDax, FMC, gained 1.3 percent to 43.16 euros. They were thus also among the favorites in the mid-cap index.      At Fresenius, quarterly sales rose slightly, while operating earnings adjusted for special effects fell far less than analysts had feared. FMC's operating profit was also better than expected, as Jefferies analyst James Vane-Tempest pointed out. However, Bernstein analyst Lisa Bedell Clive cautioned, expectations for the bloodwashing specialist had also been very low. The expert was not surprised by the lack of a major jump in the FMC share price after the figures after the recent good run - since the turn of the year, the price has gained a good 40 percent.       However, the better-than-expected sales and the strong quarterly operating result of the U.S. competitor DaVita from the previous evening, which also raised its annual targets, could have had a supporting effect on FMC.      Jefferies expert Vane-Tempest highlighted in particular the infusion division Kabi, which had been strong. According to him, the subsidiary Vamed was the reason why the annual targets were not raised in the first quarter, as Fresenius had initiated extensive restructuring measures at the hospital services provider.      Analyst Victoria Lambert of private bank Berenberg also praised the encouraging first quarter for Fresenius' core business segments. Kabi's margin, for example, was again within the target range set by management. The Helios hospital division performed as expected and FMC better than expected. The fact that Vamed had again made losses had also been sufficiently communicated in advance./ck/tav/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Fresenius Medical Care AG,FME,DE0005785802,Equities,Healthcare Facilities & Services

Shares recently fell three percent following the construction equipment manufacturer's quarterly report, after trading above the 23-euro mark for the first time in more than a year in the days before. The recently clearly rising 21-day line was thus not yet in danger.      According to initial voices, there was no criticism of the results. According to expert Martin Comtesse of Jefferies Research, the company had a strong start to the year - with growth and profitability both better than this year's target range.      ""Although component availability has improved significantly, logistics still faces daily challenges. However, the situation should continue to improve in the coming months,"" the Jefferies expert wrote. The strongest momentum continues to come from North America, where Wacker continues to expand its connected dealer network./tih/zb----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Wacker Neuson SE,WAC,DE000WACK012,Equities,Heavy Machinery & Vehicles

As a result of a recovery in the share price of up to 75 percent since September 2022, analyst Peter Rothenaicher downgraded the shares of the catering equipment manufacturer from ""Add"" to ""Reduce"", even though he raised the price target from 590 to 635 euros. Compared with the current price of 694 euros, this implies a downside potential of 8.5 percent.      Rothenaicher has no doubts about Rational's long-term growth prospects in his study, which was published after the close of business on Friday. The expert attributed the current valuation of the shares, which in his view is too high, to the current interest rate environment. At 7.25 percent, he included a higher weighted average cost of capital in his model.      In comparison with the last ten years, the price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of the securities is not high, the expert noted. However, this should be seen in the light of the fact that, unlike now, these years were characterized by extremely low interest rates. In view of a key interest rate of the European Central Bank (ECB) of 3.75 percent, he considers the P/E ratio ""very high"".      Operationally, however, the analyst continues to see Rational on a good path. He considers the recently presented quarterly figures to be strong and the medium-term outlook to be favorable. Within five to ten years, the company could probably grow annually in the high single-digit percentage range. In the medium term, he believes it is possible for the operating margin to reach slightly above 25 percent on a sustainable basis.      With a ""Reduce"" rating, Baader Bank expects a total return (calculated from share price increase and dividend) of -10 to +5 percent for the share over the next 12 months./tih/edh/mis      Analyzing institute Baader Bank.

More generally, Bernstein believes that the European FMCG sector is currently overvalued by up to 10%, while the economic outlook shows no potential for recovery.According to the analysts, L'Oréal remains one of the best companies in the sector, and one of the strategic stocks to hold alongside Beiersdorf, Lindt and Nestlé, but they feel they are not in a position to recommend that investors increase their positions further in the current environment.While they recognize that the group's organic growth could still surprise on the upside (+13% in the first quarter, and without the help of China), the professionals also judge that the stock remains vulnerable to a possible surge in bond yields.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

In Tradegate trading, it went down by 3.6 percent compared to the Xetra closing price after the operating result did not meet expectations. Driven by rising defense spending, the stock has been the best-performing Dax stock this year, rising more than 40 percent.      According to expert George McWhirter of Berenberg Bank, first-quarter sales exceeded expectations, but operating profit and free cash flow did not.       Above all, cash flow and the lack of a target increase should weigh on the share price at the start on Thursday, he expressed his suspicions. While the consensus is already slightly above the year-to-date targets, Rheinmetall is sticking to them./tih/zb----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Rheinmetall AG,RHM,DE0007030009,Equities,Aerospace & Defense

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SOFTWARE-AG-37926215/news/Investors-speculate-on-bidding-war-for-Software-AG-43709827/,Investors speculate on bidding war for Software AG,"May 02, 2023 at 06:51 am EDT","FRANKFURT (dpa-AFX) - The prospect of a bidding war for Software AG drove the share price on Tuesday to its highest level since June 2022. At last count, the shares were up by more than seven percent to a good 33 euros. This put them in second place in the SDax small caps index - behind the shares of SGL Carbon, which jumped even higher following a buy recommendation from Deutsche Bank.      There may be a duel in the takeover of Software AG. Almost two weeks ago, the technology investor Silver Lake had offered 30 euros per share for a purchase of the software developer. Over the weekend, financial investor Bain Capital surprisingly announced an indirect stake of a good 10 percent in the Darmstadt-based company. The Bloomberg news agency reported that Bain is seeking talks with Software AG regarding a possible merger with its portfolio company Rocket Software.      On Monday of last week, Silver Lake's purchase offer sent the Software share price shooting up by around 50 percent to the 30 euros per share offered by the prospective buyer. But the stock market quickly seemed to be betting on more: On Thursday and Friday, the shares gained a further four percent to 30.90 euros. On Friday, Silver Lake announced that it had purchased a further five percent of the software provider. The company had thus secured a total stake of more than 30 percent. Furthermore, the Software AG Foundation cannot withdraw from the purchase agreement for 25.1 percent of the shares, Silver Lake said - the agreement is also not dependent on reaching the minimum acceptance threshold. Ultimately, Software AG is to be delisted from the stock exchange.      ""Even higher interest rates have not stopped Silver Lake (...) from taking on debt for the intended takeover of Software AG (...),"" wrote analyst Chandramouli Sriraman of investment house Stifel. The topic of M&A - mergers and acquisitions - had returned to the European software industry. Cloud providers are currently proving resilient, said the expert, who referred in this context to recent high revenue growth of industry giants Microsoft and Amazon in the US. Software AG is currently rebuilding its business in the direction of subscription revenues and also intends to offer more cloud software.      The purchase price of 30 euros offered by Silver Lake represents a premium of 48 percent on the weighted average price of the past three months in terms of stock market volume, Sriraman said. The bid values the shares at almost 23 times the company's expected earnings per share for the current year. If the earnings forecast for 2024 were used as a yardstick, the premium offered to shareholders would still be just under 20 times.      Analyst Charles Brennan from US broker Jefferies also referred to a sector-specific aspect of Silver Lake's purchase offer for Software AG. While the former stock market darlings from the semiconductor industry are now struggling, investors are now turning to the software industry as a hoped-for ""safe haven"" in the technology sector. The trend toward acquisitions of medium-sized European software providers is likely to continue, Brennan suspects./bek/men/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Software AG                                                                                                        Xetra,SOW,DE000A2GS401,Equities,Software

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SGL-CARBON-SE-436603/news/Deutsche-Bank-SGL-restructuring-is-paying-off-43708219/,DEUTSCHE BANK :  SGL restructuring is paying off,"May 02, 2023 at 05:40 am EDT","FRANKFURT (dpa-AFX) - Carbon specialist SGL Carbon should gradually reap the rewards of its restructuring, according to Deutsche Bank. Analyst Lars Vom-Cleff upgraded the shares, which are listed in the small-cap index SDax, from ""hold"" to ""buy"" with a price target raised from 9.30 to 13.00 euros. This was stated in a study published on Tuesday.      Vom-Cleff considers the company's 2023 forecast for operating earnings (Ebitda) to be conservative, and the targeted sales merely at a stable level also calls for explanation. The expert raised his estimates for Ebitda in 2023 and 2024 by 15 and 16 percent, respectively. He takes into account the company's targets until 2027 and pointed out that SGL aims to increase profitability faster than sales. In the first quarter, the successful development of the previous year should have continued.      The medium-term outlook is ambitious, but nevertheless achievable. This underlines that SGL is in the process of switching from restructuring to growth mode. Free cash flow and key balance sheet ratios have improved significantly since the start of the latest restructuring program, Vom-Cleff added. He said 2023 will likely still be a year of investment and stabilization, but from next year on, all four of SGL's divisions should again demonstrate sales and earnings growth.      With a Buy rating, Deutsche Bank recommends buying the stock based on the expected total return for the next twelve months.
