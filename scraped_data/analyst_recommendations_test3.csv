              The company, which is feverishly tracked by retail investors following a meme stock frenzy in early 2021 that sent its shares to dizzying levels, has been trying to restructure itself by operating a smaller network of stores and focusing on selling more value-added items to boost sales and profitability.
              The 31% slide in GameStop's revenue in the most recent quarter overshadowed a swing to net profit. It also announced a plan to sell up to 20 million shares to fund acquisitions.
              GameStop has raised a little over $3 billion through share sales in May and June, taking advantage of wild swings in its stock following bullish bets by Keith Gill, also known as ""Roaring Kitty"", who has been a key figure in the so-called ""Reddit rally.""
              The stock more than doubled over a few days in May after Gill returned from a three-year hiatus and then crashed 40% in June after Gill's livestream failed to drum up investor interest.
              Still, the stock is up about 34% this year through Tuesday. It was trading at $21.14 in premarket trading on Wednesday.
              GameStop's stock reached an intra-day peak of nearly $121 in January 2021 from about $10 a few days earlier, in a roller-coaster ride for investors before crashing nearly 90% in the following month.

The Phase 1/2 open-label ADventure study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamic activity of BBP-631 in adults with classic CAH. To date, key results from the study include: Increased endogenous cortisol production was achieved in all patients at higher doses. A maximum change from baseline post-ACTH stimulation test of 4.7 µg/dL and 6.6 µg/dL was observed at the two highest dose levels, respectively, with cortisol levels as high as 11 ug/dL achieved.Substantial and durable increases in 11-deoxycortisol, the product of 21-hydroxylase, and reductions in 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), the substrate of 21-hydroxylase, provide compelling evidence of durable BBP-631 transgene activity. At the highest dose levels, sustained 11-deoxycortisol averaged a 55-fold increase from baseline with a maximum of 99-fold increase from baseline. These represent an average maximum of 23-fold the upper-limit of normal.Robust reduction in 17-hydroxyprogesterone, with the majority of patients reaching a reduction of =50%, with a max reduction of 95%.

              The comments from Leila Serhan came as Visa announced a strategic partnership with 1Link, Pakistan's largest payment service provider, aimed at streamlining remittances into the South Asia country and also encouraging digital transactions.  
              Pakistan, with a population of 240 million, is home to one of the world's largest unbanked populations. Only 60% of its 137 million adult population, or 83 million adults, have a bank account, based on central bank estimates.
              Visa is investing in building digital payment infrastructure in the country, aiming to make digital payments less costly and more manageable. 
              Currently, Pakistan has 120,541 point of sales (POS) machines, according to central bank data. 
              Visa intends to significantly increase this number. ""Some businesses have more than one POS machine. We're aiming at ten-folding businesses' acceptance (of digital transactions),"" said Serhan. 
              The strategy involves technology that transforms phones into payment instruments and accepting various forms of payment, including QR and card tap. Visa aims to expand beyond large cities and mainstream businesses to include smaller merchants.
              The 1Link deal aims to improve the process for sending and receiving remittances, including bolstering payments security, boosting such transactions via legal channels. 
              As one of the top remittance recipients globally, Pakistan relies heavily on funds from overseas Pakistanis, which constitute a vital source of foreign exchange and significantly contribute to the country's GDP.
              ""We're really looking forward to finishing this technical integration in the coming months, and I think it's going to be a game changer for a lot of the consumers in Pakistan,"" said Serhan.
              The partnership with 1Link will also enable 1Link's PayPak cards to be accepted on Visa's Cybersource Platform for online transactions, despite PayPak being a competitor in digital payments.
              Pakistan signed a $7 billion bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund in July, which includes reforms such as raising revenue and documenting the economy.
              ""Digital payments are going to be at the heart of what the government wants to do from a digitization perspective, and we will continue to partner with them,"" Serhan said. (Reporting by Ariba Shahid; Editing by Mark Potter)

              Fearless Fund agreed to settle the case after a federal appeals court in June agreed with the non-profit American Alliance for Equal Rights that the program likely violated a Civil War-era law barring racial discrimination in contracting.
              The non-profit was founded by Edward Blum, who through a different group spearheaded the litigation that led the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court last year to bar the consideration of race as a factor in college admissions.
              The lawsuit against Fearless Fund was filed in August 2023 and targeted the fund's Fearless Strivers Grant Contest, which awarded Black women who own small businesses $20,000 in grants and other resources to grow their businesses.
              According to the Fearless Fund, businesses owned by Black women in 2022 received less than 1% of the $288 billion that venture capital firms deployed. 
              The fund, headed by CEO and founding partner Arian Simone, has said its goal was to address that disparity. Fearless Fund counts JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and MasterCardas investors, and the fund has invested nearly $27 million into 40 startups led by women of color since 2019.
              Lawyers for Blum's group argued that by only considering Black women for grants, Fearless Fund had adopted a categorical racial bar against other applicants in violation of Section 1981 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act.
              A trial court judge initially sided with Fearless Fund. But a 2-1 panel of the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in June held the program likely violated the law, warranting a preliminary injunction pending further litigation.
              Blum in a statement on Wednesday said his group had ""encouraged the Fearless Fund to open its grant contest to Hispanic, Asian, Native American and white women but Fearless has decided instead to end it entirely.""
              Alphonso David, a lawyer for Fearless Fund, in a statement called the settlement agreement ""very narrow,"" as it does not restrict or relate to any other investment or charitable activity by Fearless Fund going forward.
              ""The Fearless Fund can now continue their work toward expanding economic opportunity,"" he said. (Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Marguerita Choy)

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CITIGROUP-INC-4818/news/How-regulators-have-overhauled-contentious-Basel-Endgame-capital-hike-rule-47850392/,How regulators have overhauled contentious Basel Endgame capital hike rule,"September 11, 2024 at 10:54 am EDT","(Reuters) -     The Federal Reserve's regulatory chief on Tuesday outlined major revisions to the Basel Endgame draft rule hiking bank capital, following intense industry pushback. The proposal, which the Fed is expected to publish in coming weeks, is subject to a vote by the central bank's board. Here are the broad changes: CREDIT RISK
              Credit risk capital requirements protect against the risk that a bank's loans will not be fully repaid.
              Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said the revised draft would lower risk-weights for residential real estate loans and loans to retail customers. The original proposal introduced a more risk-sensitive approach to those loans but lenders said that overstated their risks and would affect home affordability and homeownership. 
              The second proposed change would extend a reduced risk weight for low-risk corporate exposures to some investment grade entities that are not publicly traded. The original proposal provided this preferential treatment only to publicly traded investment-grade corporates, but the industry argued that other privately held, stringently regulated entities should also be included. The new draft will now include pension funds and certain mutual funds in this preferential treatment, Barr said.
              The third change will scrap a proposed minimum haircut for securities financing transactions. The proposal included capital requirements for repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans, but Wall Street banks lobbied hard against that proposal,  which conflicts with how other countries treat such assets. EQUITY EXPOSURES
              Barr said he plans to significantly lower the risk weight for tax credit equity funding structures, given their lower inherent risks compared to other equity investments. 
              That approach would match the Fed's approach for other tax credit investments, like low-income housing tax credits, Barr said. OPERATIONAL RISK
              A key plank of Basel aims to better measure and capitalize losses stemming from banks' operational risks, like fraud, lawsuits or cyberattacks. It had proposed adjusting that capital charge based on banks' operational loss history, but Barr said the Fed would scrap that plan, which should reduce swings in those capital requirements. 
              The operational risk part of the proposal had penalized fee-based income as more vulnerable to operational snags. But the Fed will adjust how it measures banks' share of fee-based activities to net income instead of gross revenues. 
              Using net income would produce more consistency in how operational risk is measured across bank activities and would be less sensitive to different bank accounting practices, Barr said. 
              The proposal will also reduce operational risk capital requirements for investment management activities. The Fed has ""found evidence that investment management has historically experienced noticeably low operational losses relative to income produced,"" Barr said. MARKET RISK AND DERIVATIVES
              The new draft will ease proposed constraints on banks' use of internal models for assessing the risk of trading and derivatives activities, Barr said.
              Barr said the Fed would also adjust the capital treatment for some client derivatives which are cleared to better reflect the risks of those transactions, which he noted are highly collateralized and subject to daily margin requirements. TIERING
              Under the Fed's new rule, global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and other internationally active banks would be subject to the strictest requirements. But capital requirements for large non-GSIBs would be simplified, Barr said. 
              Banks with assets between $250 billion and $700 billion that are not GSIBs or internationally active would still have to comply with the new credit risk and operational risk requirements, but only banks that engage in significant trading activity would have to comply with the market risk and certain other frameworks. 
              For those banks, as well as midsize banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, the proposal would use the current definition of capital, with the exception of applying the requirement to reflect unrealized losses and gains on certain securities. Barr said those elements better incorporate interest rate risks into capital requirements, an issue that played a central role in the failure of banks last year. 
              The credit and operational risk frameworks would also not apply to banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion.  (Reporting by Hannah Lang; Editing by Michelle Price and Andrea Ricci)

              Although the shipbuilder's order books are full, it has an almost 2.8 billion euro ($3.1 billion) financing gap due to the delayed effects of a demand dip during the COVID-19 pandemic.WHY IT'S IMPORTANT? 
              The German government and that of the state of Lower Saxony, in northwestern Germany, want to rescue Meyer Werft to secure thousands of jobs in the structurally weak Emsland region. 
              Around 17,000 jobs are directly and indirectly dependent on the family-owned shipbuilder, which has a 229-year history.
              Meyer Werft lists one of its main clients as U.S. entertainment giant Disney. In 2010 and 2011, it built the Disney Dream and the Disney Fantasy, the largest ocean liners ever made in Germany.BY THE NUMBERS
              German federal and state governments will invest 400 million euros ($442 million) in Meyer Werft for an 80% stake.
              The plan also includes guarantees for 2.6 billion euros in loans.KEY QUOTES
              ""Meyer Werft is one of the largest and most modern shipyards in the world. It is of immense importance for German shipbuilding,"" German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said.
              ""It is a temporary aid,"" said opposition politician Andreas Mattfeldt, from the Christian Democrats CDU, adding that the shipbuilder has a successful business model. 
              Green politician Sven-Christian Kindler highlighted that many jobs are at stake and this is a key industry for Germany.
              ""An agreement is now planned this week,"" Kindler said.WHAT'S NEXT?
              Final details will need to be clarified before the package is confirmed in writing in the next few days.

Expands Open Pit and Underground Mineralization At Rainy River, Demonstrates Strong Support for Mineral Resources Growth","September 11, 2024 at 06:32 am EDT","New Gold Inc. provided an update on its ongoing Rainy River exploration program. Over the first eight months of 2024, exploration drilling at Rainy River has proven successful in advancing the Company's exploration objectives to expand existing resource envelopes, confirm the continuity of potential new mining zones, and grow the mineralized footprint through new near-mine discoveries. These results are expected to have a positive impact on Rainy River's mineral resource estimate at year-end 2024 and provide high-quality targets as the foundation of the Company's exploration strategy in the coming years.Diamond drilling conducted from surface and from underground confirmed the extension of gold mineralization along strike at Intrepid and down-plunge at the ODM East and 17-East zones of Underground Main (""UG Main""). In addition, diamond drilling from the connection ramp between Intrepid and UG Main led to the intersection of sulphide-bearing gold mineralization above current underground mining cut-off grade (1.74 g/t AuEq) and minimum mining width (2.4 metres) at the Gap Area target. Completion of the reverse circulation (""RC"") drilling program confirmed the continuity of near-surface gold mineralization at NW- Trend and 280 Zone, including high-grade gold mineralization intersections at NW-Trend, providing potential opportunities for additional open pit mining.Following the highly encouraging results to date, the Company intends to allocate an additional $3 million to the 2024 Rainy River exploration program. Following early success in the first quarter, the Rainy River 2024 exploration budget was increased from $5 million to $9 million, as previously reported. The total budget for Rainy River exploration will be increased by an additional $3 million for a total of $12 million for 2024.The increased budget at Rainy River is expected to provide an additional 13,000 metres of drilling by year-end, targeting high priority targets including UG Main (ODM Main, ODM East, 17 East, and 114-Deep), Gap Area, and Intrepid. This year marks the first major exploration campaign carried out at Rainy River since mine opening in 2017. As such, several promising targets remain untested.The Rainy River 2024 exploration program is divided into three main components of equal priority: 1. Test the potential extension of underground ore zones at depth and along strike. 2. Explore the previously undrilled gap between Intrepid and UG Main. 3. Follow up on previously drilled near-surface priority targets surrounding the existing Rainy River open pit.On the first exploration component, diamond drilling conducted from surface and from underground confirmed the extension of gold mineralization along strike at Intrepid and down-plunge at the ODM East and 17 East zones at UG Main. At Intrepid, new drill intersections locally extend the mineralized envelope by approximately 100 metres towards the east, which has the potential to add underground reserves and increase the gold ounces per level. At UG Main, five boreholes intersected gold mineralization at a depth of up to 850 metres below surface, extending the resource envelopes down-plunge and confirming continuity of existing ore zones.All zones remain open at depth. The new diamond drilling results are expected to have a positive impact on underground resources at year-end. Additionally, diamond drilling conducted from the underground ramp between Intrepid and UG Main intersected new gold mineralization.UG Main and Intrepid deposits are interpreted to occur along the same stratigraphic units. However, the 1,000- metre strike length between the two deposits remained mostly undrilled prior to this year. Borehole RRUG24-0007 intersected gold-bearing sulphide mineralization grading 3.59 g/t gold over 4.50 metres core length (3 metre estimated true width), above current underground cut-off grade and minimum mining width (Figure 3).Additional underground drilling will focus on exploring the extents of this new mineralized area. All new notable diamond drilling intercepts from Intrepid, ODM East, 17 East, and Gap Area exploration programs are summarized in Tables 1 and 3, and Figure 1 below. The third exploration component is to define near-surface mineral resources with the potential to be mined by open pit methods.On review of historical exploration data and following the successful addition of Phase 5 open pit mineral reserves at year-end 2023, high-quality targets were identified, of which the NW-Trend, or Western Zone, and 280 Zone were prioritized for RC drilling in 2024. The recently completed RC drilling program proved successful in demonstrating the near-surface continuity of the targeted gold-mineralized zones. High-grade gold intersections at NW-Trend confirms the continuity of high-grade gold zones intersected in historical diamond boreholes.At 280 Zone, several gold-mineralized intersections over 10 metres wide within the first 100 metres below surface confirmed the up-dip continuity of deeper gold zones intersected in historical diamond boreholes. While the economic viability of these targets is currently under evaluation, further extension of open pit mining has the potential to defer reclaim of the low-grade stockpile and improve the long-term gold production profile.",© S&P Capital IQ - 2024,New Gold Inc.,NGD,CA6445351068,Equities,Gold

  FedEx said talks to extend its contract with the U.S. Postal Service have broken down, and the parcel carrier will let the contract end in September. 

  FedEx said in a regulatory filing that it couldn't reach an agreement to continue providing U.S. transportation services to USPS that included mutually beneficial terms to extend the contract. FedEx has provided domestic transportation services to USPS for over 20 years. 

  In recent years, the USPS contract became a drag on FedEx's earnings. FedEx Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said as recently as last month that the company was making progress on renegotiating the contract on more favorable terms. 

  FedEx has been re-tooling operations over the past year in a bid to cut costs and simplify the delivery giant's network. The company has been slashing billions in costs, spurred in part by an industry downturn in delivery volume. FedEx is also combining its Express and Ground delivery units, changing a decades-old operating structure. 

  Earlier Monday, FedEx rival United Parcel Service said it had been awarded a significant air cargo contract by the U.S. Postal Service, making UPS the primary air cargo provider for USPS. 

  Shares of FedEx fell more than 2% in premarket trading while UPS stock was up about 2%.

less reluctant to finance hostile acquisitions because the
government's new takeover guidelines have shaken off the taboo
on such deals, Japan's new banking lobby chief said.
              The comments from Akihiro Fukutome, the head of the Japanese
Bankers Association, offer evidence of a sea change in Japan
that has helped bring it closer to Western-style dealmaking.
              ""Banks were previously worried about reputational risks"" in
helping unsolicited bids, Fukutome said in an interview. ""But I
believe new takeover guidelines from the industry ministry last
year have helped lower psychological hurdles.""
              Hostile bids, once shunned because they were seen as
disruptive to Japan Inc's collaborative ethos, are still
relatively rare, but the frequency is increasing.
              The Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry (METI) last year
released new M&A guidelines aimed at cracking down on excessive
defence tactics, removing a long-held stigma around unsolicited
bids and spurring corporate takeovers.
              The non-binding guidelines have already prompted companies
such as electric motors manufacturer Nidec and life
insurer Dai-ichi Life Holdings to launch hostile
takeover bids.
              Fukutome, who also heads the core banking arm of Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group, said banks should consider
unsolicited proposals if a deal would benefit the target company
and help improve its long-term value.
              ""The atmosphere for unsolicited bids is changing, and we've
seen a rise in such deals in our pipeline,"" he added.
              There have been three hostile takeover proposals over the
last 12 months in Japan, including a bid by Brother Industries
to thwart a management buyout at Roland DG,
LSEG data shows.
              Japanese investment bank Daiwa Securities Group has
said it is open to advising a hostile acquirer on merit if the
deal would benefit the target company or its industry.

Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) said on Friday it voted to
elect activist investment firm Trian Fund Management's two
director candidates to Walt Disney's board, in one of the most
closely watched and expensive battles for corporate control.
              ""CalPERS believes Walt Disney Co will benefit from fresh
eyes on its board of directors and voted its company shares in
favor of candidates Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo,"" the U.S.
pension fund, which owned 6.65 million shares in the
entertainment giant at the end of December, told Reuters.
              CalPERS, which ranks among Walt Disney's top 30
investors, according to LSEG data, said its ""established voting
guidelines focus on the need for independent corporate boards, a
say in setting executive pay, and increased transparency. Two
new directors who are qualified and capable of leading needed
change in corporate governance will serve the Disney board
well.""
              Shareholders will decide at next week's annual meeting who
will sit on the home of Mickey Mouse's 12-person board and help
guide strategy as CEO Bob Iger seeks to transform a company
valued at $224 billion.
              As more big shareholders are expected to cast votes in
the coming days, Disney is racing to convince investors there is
no need for new blood on the board at a time when the share
price has climbed and Iger has laid out
              new initiatives
              to cut costs and reignite the company's creative spark.
              Trian and another hedge fund, Blackwells Capital, which
is trying to win three Disney board seats, are doing the same,
telling investors the Disney board has bungled succession
planning for Iger, needs to better harness technology, and
should consider separating its real estate holdings.
              Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services
(ISS) recommended that investors elect Peltz, while its much
smaller rival, Egan-Jones, recommended votes for Peltz and
Rasulo, a former Disney chief financial officer who was passed
over for the top job at the entertainment company years ago.
Glass Lewis, another proxy advisory firm, suggested investors
back all of Disney's 12 directors.

  Shares of Estée Lauder on Thursday climbed after Bank of America upgraded its recommendation on the stock to buy from neutral as the beauty giant implements a profit-recovery plan. 

  The beauty-brands conglomerate's stock is the best S&P 500 performer of the day. At 2:30 p.m. ET, shares were up 6.2% at $154.10. The stock is up about 5.4% since the beginning of the year. 

  The owner of cosmetics brands such as Clinique, La Mer and Bobbi Brown should benefit from a reacceleration of sales and profit growth as Estee Lauder exits the fiscal year ending in June 30 with better visibility into end-market demand, Bank of America analysts say in a research note. 

  The New York company lost focus on product upgrades and innovation in recent years. However, its current innovation push to respond faster to trends and repair brands portfolios should come with improvements across the prestige category. 

  Bank of America expects to see innovation specifically aimed at reversing recent market-share softness in makeup from MAC and Tom Ford. 

  Estée Lauder's success is dependent on achieving more consistent growth across developed markets and emerging markets, excluding China, given the slowdown in the travel retail island of Hainan and weaker middle class spending in beauty. 

  Still, the bank expects to see market-share growth and operating leverage as Estée Lauder reduces its reliance on China and travel retail down from a peak mix of 36% and 26% in fiscal 2021. 

  In the U.S., Estée Lauder is better aligning its distribution strategy as it reduces its dependence on department stores, the analysts said. The company just launched its first beauty store on Amazon.com for Clinique, with more brands to follow. 

  Bank of America upgraded its fiscal 2026 earnings estimates to $5.85 a share from $5.50 a share and raised its target price to $170 a share from $160 a share previously.

              The company, which is feverishly tracked by retail investors following a meme stock frenzy in early 2021 that sent its shares to dizzying levels, has been trying to restructure itself by operating a smaller network of stores and focusing on selling more value-added items to boost sales and profitability.
              The 31% slide in GameStop's revenue in the most recent quarter overshadowed a swing to net profit. It also announced a plan to sell up to 20 million shares to fund acquisitions.
              GameStop has raised a little over $3 billion through share sales in May and June, taking advantage of wild swings in its stock following bullish bets by Keith Gill, also known as ""Roaring Kitty"", who has been a key figure in the so-called ""Reddit rally.""
              The stock more than doubled over a few days in May after Gill returned from a three-year hiatus and then crashed 40% in June after Gill's livestream failed to drum up investor interest.
              Still, the stock is up about 34% this year through Tuesday. It was trading at $21.14 in premarket trading on Wednesday.
              GameStop's stock reached an intra-day peak of nearly $121 in January 2021 from about $10 a few days earlier, in a roller-coaster ride for investors before crashing nearly 90% in the following month.

The Phase 1/2 open-label ADventure study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamic activity of BBP-631 in adults with classic CAH. To date, key results from the study include: Increased endogenous cortisol production was achieved in all patients at higher doses. A maximum change from baseline post-ACTH stimulation test of 4.7 µg/dL and 6.6 µg/dL was observed at the two highest dose levels, respectively, with cortisol levels as high as 11 ug/dL achieved.Substantial and durable increases in 11-deoxycortisol, the product of 21-hydroxylase, and reductions in 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), the substrate of 21-hydroxylase, provide compelling evidence of durable BBP-631 transgene activity. At the highest dose levels, sustained 11-deoxycortisol averaged a 55-fold increase from baseline with a maximum of 99-fold increase from baseline. These represent an average maximum of 23-fold the upper-limit of normal.Robust reduction in 17-hydroxyprogesterone, with the majority of patients reaching a reduction of =50%, with a max reduction of 95%. BBP-631 has been well tolerated with only mild to moderate treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and no treatment-related SAEs reported. BridgeBio will no longer be pursuing development of BBP-631 for CAH and the Company is actively seeking partnership opportunities to support future development of BBP-631 or next-generation gene therapies for the treatment of CAH, a very prevalent genetic disease that still has significant unmet need, with more than 75,000 cases estimated in the United States and European Union.",© S&P Capital IQ - 2024,"BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.",BBIO,US10806X1028,Equities,Pharmaceuticals

              The comments from Leila Serhan came as Visa announced a strategic partnership with 1Link, Pakistan's largest payment service provider, aimed at streamlining remittances into the South Asia country and also encouraging digital transactions.  
              Pakistan, with a population of 240 million, is home to one of the world's largest unbanked populations. Only 60% of its 137 million adult population, or 83 million adults, have a bank account, based on central bank estimates.
              Visa is investing in building digital payment infrastructure in the country, aiming to make digital payments less costly and more manageable. 
              Currently, Pakistan has 120,541 point of sales (POS) machines, according to central bank data. 
              Visa intends to significantly increase this number. ""Some businesses have more than one POS machine. We're aiming at ten-folding businesses' acceptance (of digital transactions),"" said Serhan. 
              The strategy involves technology that transforms phones into payment instruments and accepting various forms of payment, including QR and card tap. Visa aims to expand beyond large cities and mainstream businesses to include smaller merchants.
              The 1Link deal aims to improve the process for sending and receiving remittances, including bolstering payments security, boosting such transactions via legal channels. 
              As one of the top remittance recipients globally, Pakistan relies heavily on funds from overseas Pakistanis, which constitute a vital source of foreign exchange and significantly contribute to the country's GDP.
              ""We're really looking forward to finishing this technical integration in the coming months, and I think it's going to be a game changer for a lot of the consumers in Pakistan,"" said Serhan.

              Fearless Fund agreed to settle the case after a federal appeals court in June agreed with the non-profit American Alliance for Equal Rights that the program likely violated a Civil War-era law barring racial discrimination in contracting.
              The non-profit was founded by Edward Blum, who through a different group spearheaded the litigation that led the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court last year to bar the consideration of race as a factor in college admissions.
              The lawsuit against Fearless Fund was filed in August 2023 and targeted the fund's Fearless Strivers Grant Contest, which awarded Black women who own small businesses $20,000 in grants and other resources to grow their businesses.
              According to the Fearless Fund, businesses owned by Black women in 2022 received less than 1% of the $288 billion that venture capital firms deployed. 
              The fund, headed by CEO and founding partner Arian Simone, has said its goal was to address that disparity. Fearless Fund counts JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and MasterCardas investors, and the fund has invested nearly $27 million into 40 startups led by women of color since 2019.
              Lawyers for Blum's group argued that by only considering Black women for grants, Fearless Fund had adopted a categorical racial bar against other applicants in violation of Section 1981 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act.
              A trial court judge initially sided with Fearless Fund. But a 2-1 panel of the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in June held the program likely violated the law, warranting a preliminary injunction pending further litigation.
              Blum in a statement on Wednesday said his group had ""encouraged the Fearless Fund to open its grant contest to Hispanic, Asian, Native American and white women but Fearless has decided instead to end it entirely.""
              Alphonso David, a lawyer for Fearless Fund, in a statement called the settlement agreement ""very narrow,"" as it does not restrict or relate to any other investment or charitable activity by Fearless Fund going forward.
              ""The Fearless Fund can now continue their work toward expanding economic opportunity,"" he said. (Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Marguerita Choy)

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CITIGROUP-INC-4818/news/How-regulators-have-overhauled-contentious-Basel-Endgame-capital-hike-rule-47850392/,How regulators have overhauled contentious Basel Endgame capital hike rule,"September 11, 2024 at 10:54 am EDT","(Reuters) -     The Federal Reserve's regulatory chief on Tuesday outlined major revisions to the Basel Endgame draft rule hiking bank capital, following intense industry pushback. The proposal, which the Fed is expected to publish in coming weeks, is subject to a vote by the central bank's board. Here are the broad changes: CREDIT RISK
              Credit risk capital requirements protect against the risk that a bank's loans will not be fully repaid.
              Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said the revised draft would lower risk-weights for residential real estate loans and loans to retail customers. The original proposal introduced a more risk-sensitive approach to those loans but lenders said that overstated their risks and would affect home affordability and homeownership. 
              The second proposed change would extend a reduced risk weight for low-risk corporate exposures to some investment grade entities that are not publicly traded. The original proposal provided this preferential treatment only to publicly traded investment-grade corporates, but the industry argued that other privately held, stringently regulated entities should also be included. The new draft will now include pension funds and certain mutual funds in this preferential treatment, Barr said.
              The third change will scrap a proposed minimum haircut for securities financing transactions. The proposal included capital requirements for repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans, but Wall Street banks lobbied hard against that proposal,  which conflicts with how other countries treat such assets. EQUITY EXPOSURES
              Barr said he plans to significantly lower the risk weight for tax credit equity funding structures, given their lower inherent risks compared to other equity investments. 
              That approach would match the Fed's approach for other tax credit investments, like low-income housing tax credits, Barr said. OPERATIONAL RISK
              A key plank of Basel aims to better measure and capitalize losses stemming from banks' operational risks, like fraud, lawsuits or cyberattacks. It had proposed adjusting that capital charge based on banks' operational loss history, but Barr said the Fed would scrap that plan, which should reduce swings in those capital requirements. 
              The operational risk part of the proposal had penalized fee-based income as more vulnerable to operational snags. But the Fed will adjust how it measures banks' share of fee-based activities to net income instead of gross revenues. 
              Using net income would produce more consistency in how operational risk is measured across bank activities and would be less sensitive to different bank accounting practices, Barr said. 
              The proposal will also reduce operational risk capital requirements for investment management activities. The Fed has ""found evidence that investment management has historically experienced noticeably low operational losses relative to income produced,"" Barr said. MARKET RISK AND DERIVATIVES
              The new draft will ease proposed constraints on banks' use of internal models for assessing the risk of trading and derivatives activities, Barr said.
              Barr said the Fed would also adjust the capital treatment for some client derivatives which are cleared to better reflect the risks of those transactions, which he noted are highly collateralized and subject to daily margin requirements. TIERING
              Under the Fed's new rule, global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and other internationally active banks would be subject to the strictest requirements. But capital requirements for large non-GSIBs would be simplified, Barr said. 
              Banks with assets between $250 billion and $700 billion that are not GSIBs or internationally active would still have to comply with the new credit risk and operational risk requirements, but only banks that engage in significant trading activity would have to comply with the market risk and certain other frameworks. 
              For those banks, as well as midsize banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, the proposal would use the current definition of capital, with the exception of applying the requirement to reflect unrealized losses and gains on certain securities. Barr said those elements better incorporate interest rate risks into capital requirements, an issue that played a central role in the failure of banks last year. 
              The credit and operational risk frameworks would also not apply to banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion.  (Reporting by Hannah Lang; Editing by Michelle Price and Andrea Ricci)

              Although the shipbuilder's order books are full, it has an almost 2.8 billion euro ($3.1 billion) financing gap due to the delayed effects of a demand dip during the COVID-19 pandemic.WHY IT'S IMPORTANT? 
              The German government and that of the state of Lower Saxony, in northwestern Germany, want to rescue Meyer Werft to secure thousands of jobs in the structurally weak Emsland region. 
              Around 17,000 jobs are directly and indirectly dependent on the family-owned shipbuilder, which has a 229-year history.
              Meyer Werft lists one of its main clients as U.S. entertainment giant Disney. In 2010 and 2011, it built the Disney Dream and the Disney Fantasy, the largest ocean liners ever made in Germany.BY THE NUMBERS
              German federal and state governments will invest 400 million euros ($442 million) in Meyer Werft for an 80% stake.
              The plan also includes guarantees for 2.6 billion euros in loans.KEY QUOTES
              ""Meyer Werft is one of the largest and most modern shipyards in the world. It is of immense importance for German shipbuilding,"" German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said.
              ""It is a temporary aid,"" said opposition politician Andreas Mattfeldt, from the Christian Democrats CDU, adding that the shipbuilder has a successful business model. 
              Green politician Sven-Christian Kindler highlighted that many jobs are at stake and this is a key industry for Germany.
              ""An agreement is now planned this week,"" Kindler said.WHAT'S NEXT?
              Final details will need to be clarified before the package is confirmed in writing in the next few days.

Expands Open Pit and Underground Mineralization At Rainy River, Demonstrates Strong Support for Mineral Resources Growth","September 11, 2024 at 06:32 am EDT","New Gold Inc. provided an update on its ongoing Rainy River exploration program. Over the first eight months of 2024, exploration drilling at Rainy River has proven successful in advancing the Company's exploration objectives to expand existing resource envelopes, confirm the continuity of potential new mining zones, and grow the mineralized footprint through new near-mine discoveries. These results are expected to have a positive impact on Rainy River's mineral resource estimate at year-end 2024 and provide high-quality targets as the foundation of the Company's exploration strategy in the coming years.Diamond drilling conducted from surface and from underground confirmed the extension of gold mineralization along strike at Intrepid and down-plunge at the ODM East and 17-East zones of Underground Main (""UG Main""). In addition, diamond drilling from the connection ramp between Intrepid and UG Main led to the intersection of sulphide-bearing gold mineralization above current underground mining cut-off grade (1.74 g/t AuEq) and minimum mining width (2.4 metres) at the Gap Area target. Completion of the reverse circulation (""RC"") drilling program confirmed the continuity of near-surface gold mineralization at NW- Trend and 280 Zone, including high-grade gold mineralization intersections at NW-Trend, providing potential opportunities for additional open pit mining.Following the highly encouraging results to date, the Company intends to allocate an additional $3 million to the 2024 Rainy River exploration program. Following early success in the first quarter, the Rainy River 2024 exploration budget was increased from $5 million to $9 million, as previously reported. The total budget for Rainy River exploration will be increased by an additional $3 million for a total of $12 million for 2024.The increased budget at Rainy River is expected to provide an additional 13,000 metres of drilling by year-end, targeting high priority targets including UG Main (ODM Main, ODM East, 17 East, and 114-Deep), Gap Area, and Intrepid. This year marks the first major exploration campaign carried out at Rainy River since mine opening in 2017. As such, several promising targets remain untested.The Rainy River 2024 exploration program is divided into three main components of equal priority: 1. Test the potential extension of underground ore zones at depth and along strike. 2. Explore the previously undrilled gap between Intrepid and UG Main. 3. Follow up on previously drilled near-surface priority targets surrounding the existing Rainy River open pit.On the first exploration component, diamond drilling conducted from surface and from underground confirmed the extension of gold mineralization along strike at Intrepid and down-plunge at the ODM East and 17 East zones at UG Main. At Intrepid, new drill intersections locally extend the mineralized envelope by approximately 100 metres towards the east, which has the potential to add underground reserves and increase the gold ounces per level. At UG Main, five boreholes intersected gold mineralization at a depth of up to 850 metres below surface, extending the resource envelopes down-plunge and confirming continuity of existing ore zones.All zones remain open at depth. The new diamond drilling results are expected to have a positive impact on underground resources at year-end. Additionally, diamond drilling conducted from the underground ramp between Intrepid and UG Main intersected new gold mineralization.UG Main and Intrepid deposits are interpreted to occur along the same stratigraphic units. However, the 1,000- metre strike length between the two deposits remained mostly undrilled prior to this year. Borehole RRUG24-0007 intersected gold-bearing sulphide mineralization grading 3.59 g/t gold over 4.50 metres core length (3 metre estimated true width), above current underground cut-off grade and minimum mining width (Figure 3).Additional underground drilling will focus on exploring the extents of this new mineralized area. All new notable diamond drilling intercepts from Intrepid, ODM East, 17 East, and Gap Area exploration programs are summarized in Tables 1 and 3, and Figure 1 below. The third exploration component is to define near-surface mineral resources with the potential to be mined by open pit methods.On review of historical exploration data and following the successful addition of Phase 5 open pit mineral reserves at year-end 2023, high-quality targets were identified, of which the NW-Trend, or Western Zone, and 280 Zone were prioritized for RC drilling in 2024. The recently completed RC drilling program proved successful in demonstrating the near-surface continuity of the targeted gold-mineralized zones. High-grade gold intersections at NW-Trend confirms the continuity of high-grade gold zones intersected in historical diamond boreholes.At 280 Zone, several gold-mineralized intersections over 10 metres wide within the first 100 metres below surface confirmed the up-dip continuity of deeper gold zones intersected in historical diamond boreholes. While the economic viability of these targets is currently under evaluation, further extension of open pit mining has the potential to defer reclaim of the low-grade stockpile and improve the long-term gold production profile.",© S&P Capital IQ - 2024,New Gold Inc.,NGD,CA6445351068,Equities,Gold

              Air Canada said on Monday it was finalizing plans to suspend most of its operations as soon as talks with the pilots' union were nearing an impasse over ""inflexible"" wage demands. The union says the airline needs ""to get serious at the bargaining table.""
              In a letter to Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon, the groups noted he had stepped in quickly last month to halt a stoppage at the country's two main rail companies, forcing employees back to work and imposing binding arbitration.
              ""The federal government needs to take decisive action. The impacts of a labor disruption at Air Canada will ripple throughout the economy,"" they said.
              ""Should the parties not come to a negotiated agreement, the federal government must... be prepared to act in advance to prevent yet another damaging disruption by referring the matter to binding arbitration where a neutral arbitrator can resolve any outstanding issues.""
              A strike could start as soon as Sept 18. In a statement, MacKinnon's office said Ottawa believed in the collective bargaining process.     
              Air Canada and its low-cost subsidiary, Air Canada Rouge, together operate nearly 670 flights per day. A shutdown could affect 110,000 passengers daily.
              ""If Canadian businesses are unable to deliver our goods to market on time, our international partners will begin to seek permanent alternatives,"" the business groups warned. A strike ""will reinforce a growing perception that Canada is not a reliable trading partner.""
