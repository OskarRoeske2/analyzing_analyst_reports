URW published very satisfactory third-quarter data in the wake of a good first half"", says the analyst, who points to ""impressive"" like-for-like rental growth.  These good figures militate in favor of a return to distribution, which is still not certain, but probable, with a pay-out that we expect to be low. However, this should be sufficient to ensure a satisfactory return, given the low share price"", he continues.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

On the contrary, the shares recently gained 1.6 percent in pre-borsday trading on Tradegate compared to the Xetra close at 42.35 euros.      Because of its oil and gas subsidiary Wintershall, the Ludwigshafen-based company suffered a quarterly loss and is becoming more cautious for 2023. The cut in the forecast, however, had been an open secret, said a trader, who advises buying on price weaknesses.      With a minus of a good ten percent so far in 2023, BASF has fared significantly worse than the Dax. In the area of the mark around 40 euros, however, recently held again the support./ajx/zb----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,BASF SE,BAS,DE000BASF111,Equities,Diversified Chemicals

Against this backdrop, Sopra Steria's management has confirmed its 2023 guidance of organic growth and FCF of at least 300 ME. At this stage, the tone is relatively cautious for 2024.

Following this publication, Oddo BHF confirms its Outperform recommendation on the value and its target of 105 E.' Sanofi released its Q3 23 results this morning, which came in below expectations in terms of sales and Core EPS. Sanofi continues to be impacted by a deleterious exchange rate effect over the period (-7% on the top line and -9% on the bottom line)' says Oddo BHF. The analyst points out that the Group's total sales came to 11,964 ME versus 12,097 ME expected (-4.1%; +3.2% cc), its core EBIT to 4,028 ME versus 4,078ME expected (-10.4%; -1% cc) for a core EPS of 2.55 E versus 2.61 E expected (source: Vara Research).  On the Vaccines side, sales of seasonal flu were below expectations, due in particular to a sharp decline in the vaccination rate"", says the research firm. Oddo BHF indicates that the market should focus on the announcement of the strategic plan presented this morning.The plan implies an exit from its Consumer business (at the earliest in Q4 2024), and cost savings of E2 billion between 2024 and 2025, which will be reinvested in full.  The disappointment comes from the initial guidance for 2024 and the announcement of the end of its MT guidance. Indeed, due to a higher-than-anticipated tax rate (up from 19% to 21% next year), the Group expects its Core EPS to fall in the low single-digit range. Consensus forecasts had previously been for a 6% increase next year. In addition, Sanofi will no longer target a Core EBIT ratio of 32% in 2025. An adjustment of expectations of the same order as in 2024 is to be expected' adds Oddo BHF.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

The analyst recalls that Valeo yesterday published Q3 sales of 5224 ME, in line with expectations, and believes that the absence of outperformance is explained in particular by the current weakness of momentum in BEVs (battery electric vehicles). In particular, the broker is cautious about 2024, and below consensus expectations (-6% on EBIT, -29% on FCF), notably due to difficult production momentum, a customer mix that is likely to remain unfavorable, and continuing strong cost pressure (wage inflation).  Nevertheless, despite the cautious messages heard from some competitors and even automakers, management is confident and has fully confirmed its annual targets (consensus in line)"", stresses Oddo BHF, which believes that these factors should largely reassure the markets. The equipment manufacturer has therefore maintained its annual targets unchanged, and is still aiming for 1/ sales of €22-23 bn (cons. €22.2 bn); 2/ an operating margin of between 3.2-4.0% (cons. 3.6%), suggesting a mid-range adjusted EBIT of €810 m (cons. €802 m) and a FCF >€320 m (cons. €352 m).

While the analyst considers this warning to be ""very significant"", particularly in terms of FCF (-30/60% on FCF 23/24), he believes that ""it is above all the Group's communication that was punished yesterday"". Oddo BHF believes that the accumulation of several issues (macro slowdown in Germany, quality of e-tailers) and the decision to proceed at the same time with a restructuring program (250 ME) have created confusion and fed the idea that Worldline could be suffering from more structural problems.Yesterday, following the publication of lower-than-expected sales, Worldline revised its 2023 guidance, now anticipating organic sales growth of 6/7% (vs. 8/10%), which implies growth of ~3% in Q4. In addition, the OMDA margin has been revised down by 150 bp (vs >+100 bp previously). The broker points to three key issues, namely the macro slowdown in Germany, the new restructuring plan and the termination of contracts by certain retailers.Oddo BHF's view is that an extremely gloomy scenario seems 'predicated'.  To justify the current price in our DCF (WACC of 13%), we would therefore need a very pessimistic (and not very credible) financial scenario of a 3% decline in annual sales, operating margins down by 100 bp a year, a cash generation profile well below that of the past, and a zero long-term growth rate"", concludes the broker.

The decisive factor for them now is the way forward and the question of where risks still threaten before things start to look up again.

Most recently, they fell 4.6 percent to 142 euros, reinforcing the downward trend that has been underway since early September. At 141.60 euros, they had marked their lowest level since May 2021 on Monday.      In a recent analysis, expert Richard Vosser of JPMorgan referred to detailed study data on the competitor products Padcev and Keytruda for the treatment of bladder cancer. These would have confirmed the risks with regard to sales of Merck KGaA's corresponding drug Bavencio. Up to 50 percent of these revenues could be lost in 2027.      Since the beginning of the year, the shares of Merck KGaA are among the weakest stocks in the Dax with a minus of more than one fifth. Information from the Darmstadt-based company's Capital Markets Day last week, according to which the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group intends to return to the road to success soon after 2023, which was marked by difficulties, only brought a temporary recovery in the share price.      In the European pharmaceutical sector, the shares were far behind on Monday. The sector as a whole has been under heavy pressure for several days. Negative corporate news, for example from laboratory equipment supplier Sartorius, weighed.       Positive news, such as from diabetes group Novo Nordisk, was interpreted negatively by investors for the shares of Fresenius and Fresenius Medical Care, which have since fallen sharply./ajx/la/zb",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Merck KGaA,MRK,DE0006599905,Equities,Pharmaceuticals

In the morning, the shares of the pharmaceutical and laboratory equipment manufacturer were the tail end of a weak Dax, plummeting 3.50 percent to 231.60 euros. This marked a further low since April 2020 at the start of the week, after they had still risen to almost 632 euros during the biotech boom in the Corona crisis towards the end of 2021.      In mid-October, the Gottingen-based company had reduced its outlook for the year. The company is being hampered by a surprisingly long period of destocking following the end of the pandemic, as well as relatively low production levels at some customers. Added to this is generally subdued investment activity by customers, particularly in China and the USA.      Investors are also concerned about the medium-term outlook. About two weeks ago, Sartorius confirmed its ""fundamentally positive medium- and long-term market outlook. However, it had also said that the medium-term targets were currently being reviewed and that an update would also be communicated at the beginning of next year. Until then, there is uncertainty, which is causing unease among investors.      Since the outlook was lowered, Sartorius' share price has already fallen by around 28 percent. In 2023, the share price is down 37 percent. This makes the shares the second-weakest stock in Germany's leading index, the Dax, which is currently still posting a gain of around six percent.      With the minus, the papers have also now eaten up almost all the gains from the Corona pandemic. At the end of 2019, the shares had still cost around 200 euros. Despite the losses since the record high, the share is significantly more expensive than ten years ago. In October 2013, the share was still worth less than 20 euros; 20 years ago it was less than 2 euros.      The company is currently valued on the stock exchange at just under 16 billion euros. Major shareholders are the heirs of the company's founder and the US company Bio-Rad Laboratories. The capital is divided into ordinary and preferred shares. The latter have been listed on the Dax since September 2021. Since the free float of preferred shares is now only just under six billion euros, membership of Germany's premier Borse league could again be at risk in the medium term./mis/ajx/zb/jha/",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Sartorius AG,SRT3,DE0007165631,Equities,Advanced Medical Equipment & Technology

The commitment has been respected, and the Group confirmed its exit from the ALNG2 project on July 27, 2023 when it published its half-year results"", reports the analyst.The broker believes that the main financial risk lies in a possible fine for non-compliance with the sanctions, a fine that Oddo BHF estimates could potentially amount to between 50 and 100 ME, an amount deemed ""easily affordable for the Group"".However, the analyst also points to another commercial risk, rather localized to the US market, where Technip Energies could be penalized in future tenders in the region.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

This morning, Invest Securities raised its recommendation to buy (from neutral) on the stock, with a target price of 155E in line with the offer price.The analyst believes that the stock has fallen below 150E, and now offers significant potential in relation to Keysight's offer price of 155E, which should be launched in late 2023/early 2024.  Given that Keysight has secured the support of shareholders representing more than 50% of the capital, the risk of failure of the operation is very low, and there is even a possibility that Keysight will have to outbid us if it wants to obtain more than 90% of the capital and carry out the squeeze-out (cf.

Oddo BHF believes that Technip Energies has never concealed this contract or its desire for a controlled exit. The commitment has been respected, and the Group confirmed its exit from the ALNG2 project on July 27, 2023 when it published its half-year results', reports the analyst.  The broker considers that the main financial risk lies in a possible fine for non-compliance with the sanctions, a fine that Oddo BHF estimates could potentially amount to between €50 and €100 million, an amount deemed 'easily affordable for the Group'. However, the analyst also points to another risk, a commercial one, rather localized to the US market, where Technip Energies could be penalized in future tenders in the region.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Given that Keysight has secured the support of shareholders representing more than 50% of the capital, the risk of failure of the operation is very low, and there is even a possibility that Keysight will have to outbid us if it wants to obtain more than 90% of the capital and carry out the squeeze-out (cf.

Unlike its competitor, the German inverter manufacturer is expected to post an excellent third quarter after raising its targets a few weeks ago, analyst Constantin Hesse wrote in a research note published on Friday. However, the expert is concerned about Solaredge's bleak outlook for the final quarter. The order intake in particular could possibly also be a problem for SMA Solar - according to Hesse, this is likely to have already weakened in the past quarter./tav/tih  Publication of the original study: 19.10.2023 / 17:25 / ET First disclosure of the original study: 19.10.2023 / 17:25 / ET----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,SMA Solar Technology AG,S92,DE000A0DJ6J9,Equities,Semiconductors

The topic of GLP-1 is currently dominating discussions, analyst Sam England wrote in a study on the medical technology sector presented on Thursday. This refers to the new class of antidiabetic drugs that are also suitable for people with weight problems and have become a multi-billion market. However, Sartorius is also in the focus of investors after its recent profit warning. Many among them believed that falling market expectations for 2024 were now already priced in.

The food group's papers fell by as much as 6.6 percent to 13.82 euros. The low for the year of 13.41 euros, which was only reached at the end of last week, has thus come back into focus.      The topic of GLP-1 is currently on everyone's lips. This refers to the new class of antidiabetic drugs, which have also proved to be a boon for people with weight problems. As a result, they have become a multi-billion dollar market. But one man's joy is another man's sorrow - because for food producers, curbed appetites are more of a curse.       In a recent industry study, Barclays expert Alex Sloane also addressed the burden of GLP-1, saying that the ""bear scenario"" caused by these drugs is difficult to assess. However, the increasingly negative perception of the health risks of highly processed foods could further depress growth forecasts. In any case, Sloane is becoming very cautious.      He lowered his Südzucker rating to ""Underweight"" with a target of only 12 euros. Südzucker is not directly affected by GLP-1, but could be if the wave of acceptance with the help of the funds spilled over into Europe. In addition, the expert sees a possible shift in the sugar market towards surpluses.

The papers of the laboratory and pharmaceutical supplier recovered by up to 8.6 percent to 276 euros. The day before, at 251.50 euros, they had cost less than at any time since May 2020. Since the forecast reduction last Friday, they had lost almost 22 percent.      Now followed on the penultimate trading day of the week the complete quarterly report. JPMorgan expert Richard Vosser positively assessed the surprisingly good order situation in the Bioprocess Solutions (BPS) division. He expects the share price to recover by 5 to 10 percent - also in the shares of the subsidiary Sartorius Stedim Biotech, under whose umbrella the biotechnology business is largely managed. After plummeting 21 percent in the past few days, these shares had already recovered and recently climbed another 7.8 percent./ag/tav",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Sartorius AG,SRT3,DE0007165631,Equities,Advanced Medical Equipment & Technology

They thus jumped above several chart averages pointing the way for the short- to medium-term trend and were among the biggest winners on the Dax. Since the beginning of the year, they have already gained more than a third in value.      The software group sees itself on course to meet its annual targets following significant growth, particularly in the promising cloud business. Reactions on the market were predominantly positive.      Jefferies analyst Charles Brennan commented that the Walldorf-based company had performed better than he had feared. Michael Briest of the major Swiss bank UBS also attested to SAP's ""very respectable figures. However, he said that in order to achieve the confirmed annual targets, the company would have to increase cloud revenues by at least a quarter in the final quarter - up from 23 percent in the quarter just ended.       Knut Woller of Baader Bank saw the operating result (Ebit) above expectations thanks to the strong licensing business - only cloud revenues had disappointed a little. With a stock market value of almost 160 billion euros, SAP is by far the most highly valued company in Germany./gl/zb----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,SAP SE,SAP,DE0007164600,Equities,Software

The new weight-loss drugs pose a structural threat to food ingredient manufacturers, analyst Alex Sloane wrote in an industry report available Thursday. This is because the increasing public debate about health risks from highly processed foods could further weigh on market expectations for their growth prospects. Therefore, he sees the relevant companies increasingly cautious. Südzucker was still little affected by this due to its low US exposure, but as soon as the weight loss products became more common in Europe as well, this could change./gl/edh      Publication of the original study: 18.10.2023 / 16:19 / GMT First disclosure of the original study: 19.10.2023 / 04:10 / GMT----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Südzucker AG,SZU,DE0007297004,Equities,Food Processing

The issue of 1.9 million new shares at a subscription price of 3.6 euros will raise the capital by 7 million euros, and management believes that this operation will extend the company's cash flow horizon to early 2024.In this context, management is taking advantage of this financing to reiterate and confirm its targets, notably the development of sales in Europe and sales of between 4 and 6 million euros for the 2nd half of the year.  On the other hand, management still needs to find new financing sources quickly if it is to achieve its short-term objectives"", says the analyst, who is nevertheless convinced of the positioning of Carmat's artificial heart, Aeson®.Oddo BHF believes that the share price could remain under pressure in the short term until financial visibility improves significantly.

Sodexo is also expected to communicate differentiated 2024 guidance for OSS and Pluxee. At this stage, Oddo BHF expects organic growth of 7.7% for Sodexo over 2024e (consensus 6.3%), including +7.5% for OSS and +12.0% for Pluxee, and an EBIT margin of 5.8% (consensus 5.8%), including 5.0% for OSS and 32.8% for Pluxee.In addition to the catalyst linked to the Pluxee spin-off, which should drive the share's rerating over the coming months, we appreciate Sodexo's defensive profile in the current context, as 55% of its sales are generated in sectors that are not dependent on the macroeconomic context (healthcare, education, etc.)"", concludes the broker, who adds that he is ""broadly in line with consensus over 2023e, but 3% above on average over 2024e.

Analysts had already feared a profit warning, but also pointed to the announced review of the company's medium-term targets. Richard Vosser of U.S. bank JPMorgan now expects consensus estimates to drop significantly not only for 2023, but also for the coming years.      Sartorius shares slipped 15 percent at the bottom of the Dax to a low since mid-2020 and were still down 11.7 percent to 284 euros at midday. Sartorius Stedim Biotech was down 15.7 percent at 189.55 euros, having at times been as cheap as they were last in April 2020. This dragged down the entire medical sector, with the European sector index, which had recently recovered, losing 1.3 percent.      The year-to-date performance of both stocks is also dismal. While Sartorius has lost around 23 percent, making it one of the weakest stocks in Germany's leading index, the subsidiary's share price has fallen by a good 37 percent. Compared to their record highs in the fall of 2021, Sartorius and Sartorius Stedim Biotech have lost more than half and almost two-thirds of their value, respectively.      With the publication of key data for the third quarter, it became known that Sartorius now expects sales revenue to decline by about 17 percent in 2023. Previously, the company had spoken of a decline ""in the low to mid-teens percent range."" For the operating Ebitda margin (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), Sartorius now expects to achieve slightly more than 28 percent, down from the previous figure of around 30 percent, which also means a more significant decline compared with the previous year's figure.      Sartorius expects to achieve profitable growth in 2024. However, investors will not know more details until January. However, the company also said that its medium-term targets are currently being reviewed and that an update will also be communicated at the beginning of next year.      JPMorgan expert Vosser saw the sales and even more so the operating profit development of both companies in the third quarter clearly below expectations. The same applies to the new annual outlook. Oliver Metzger of the investment bank Oddo BHF attested that Sartorius had a very weak third quarter and considered its medium-term targets to be too ambitious. At the same time, the share is still expensive, added Warburg analyst Michael Heider.      Some experts, however, already see light at the end of the tunnel. After the recent cautious comments by Sartorius and industry peers, the reduced annual targets do not come as a big surprise to him, wrote Odysseas Manesiotis of the private bank Berenberg. Investors should seize the slump in the share price as an opportunity to enter the market.      James Vane-Tempest of the U.S. analyst firm Jefferies predicts some fluctuations in Sartorius shares until the trends stabilize again and there is more clarity. However, he emphasized that the medium- to long-term growth trends in the industry are intact./gl/ag/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Sartorius AG,SRT3,DE0007165631,Equities,Advanced Medical Equipment & Technology

The research firm reports that Moody's has confirmed its Baa3 rating on Alstom, but with its outlook lowered to negative, reflecting Alstom's very limited room for maneuver in the Baa3 category.Moody's points in particular to 'weak credit metrics', impacted by the negative FCF expected in H1 and revised FCF forecasts for FY23/24, which are expected to be negative in the range of -500 ME to -750 ME (versus slightly positive in the previous estimate). Oddo BHF understands that Moody's seems prepared to give Alstom a few more months to restore its balance sheet, provided that the latter rapidly proceeds with disposals (Chinese JVs, US freight signaling business, etc.). Given the current pressure on Alstom (notably on the stock market, and now on credit), Oddo BHF expects the Group to react quickly and present a plan to strengthen its balance sheet. In addition to possible disposals, the Group could consider other measures (entry of a long-term shareholder, convertible bonds, etc.).' A capital increase, given the current share price, does not seem the most likely option in the short term', concludes the analyst. Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/GROUPE-SFPI-5194/news/SFPI-Group-A-difficult-H1-2023-45021750/,SFPI GROUP  :  A difficult H1-2023,"October 09, 2023 at 12:15 pm EDT","A difficult H1-2023EARNINGS/SALES RELEASESThe building-related activities (DOM & MAC) could not escape a sudden softening in the market even though they enjoy the nominal steadiness of renovation markets. The industry-related activities shone but accounted for less than 30% of revenues. The management is worried about H2 and slashed its sales guidance to €680m which now looks like a floor. We have cut our 2023 earning forecast by c.30%. FACTStrong organic sales (up 7.5%) were accompanied by a 200bp drop in the operating margin to 3.9% and a contraction in net earnings to €6.6m from €11m. 
With a still-demanding working capital requirement, the net cash situation (as per the SFPI definition) was down to €11.4m vs. €25.5m a year earlier. The balance sheet remains extremely sound with net cash expected to improve as excess inventories are run down.ANALYSISThe H1 earnings were not expected to be good as European building markets have hit the buffers of fast rising rates. Building is always the first to be impacted. Industry is unlikely to escape a degree of slowdown somewhat later. For 2023, SFPI’s industrial units are doing remarkably well in meeting the solid demand with a lean industrial base.
The negative surprise was the drop in the gross margin to 57.1% from 58.8%. This came from the building side and confirmed that demand has become price sensitive. With the renovation markets accounting for 80%-90% of revenues, MAC (mostly windows and doors) sales were somewhat cushioned  but it is reasonable to expect that this segment will tank as well at a later stage
Solid cost control at the payroll level was sadly not enough to offset the extra layers of miscellaneous costs including the in-depth reorganisation of the industrial bases of MAC. This was well flagged when SFPI released its 2022FY accounts thus should be regarded as costs incurred for a good cause.
The Industrial units were the H1 positive with MMD posting sales up 37% and Neu-JFK up 11.5%. There is no shortage of demand for heat exchangers and air treatment but these are businesses where order books are not very long so that the more than 6 months of business ahead is great to have. 
As with many other manufacturing businesses, SFPI has had to face a supply scarcity in the post-Covid recovery period. Building up inventories was unavoidable and presumably at higher costs than the going prices. This shows up in an increase of working capital requirement of c. €10m yoy but was contained to €2m vs. the close of 2022. After allowing for dividends and acquisitions in the H1, the gross cash position remains very healthy at €117m. This is largely due to strong cash from operations (€21m)IMPACTThe ever-cautious SFPI has slashed its sales guidance from €715m to €680m – a strong statement about the changing visibility. We see €680m as a floor that we have not adopted for our reduced forecast with sales resetting at €695m. Pressuring sales down further would probably imply a collapse of profits. On sales at €695m, our earnings forecasts reset 30% lower for 2023 and c.8% to 10% lower for the following 2 years. This does not change our target price that much (provided that the dividend does not take a hit). The news flow is however unlikely to be positive for the next few quarters.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Groupe SFPI,SFPI,FR0004155000,Equities,Construction Supplies & Fixtures

With Eiffage due to publish its quarterly results on November 8, the analyst expects trends in the second quarter of 2023 to continue.For fiscal 2023, the brokerage slightly increases its sales estimates by +1.1% to 21.8 billion euros (+1.0% vs. consensus), and its current operating profit estimate by +1.1% to 2,396 million euros (+1.1% vs. consensus), implying a stable margin. Nevertheless, Stifel feels that the stock looks 'oversold and cheap', which is not without reason, the analyst pointing in particular to the high level of bond yields and also questioning the long-term strategy.

They fell to their lowest level since mid-July. Most recently, the bills were quoted 8.5 percent lower at 54.54 euros. Next Monday marks the start of the black-out period, during which the Group will cease its financial communications with market participants ahead of its quarterly report at the end of October. Borsians are now worried that Puma will dampen expectations in final analyst rounds.       However, Puma has now once again announced that it is fully on track to meet its annual targets. However, this did not provide lasting relief, and the slight price recovery quickly collapsed again.      In mid-July, Puma had already confirmed its annual targets. In the meantime, however, there have been some negative signals from fashion retailers, for example, regarding September business. Adidas shares lost up to 4.6 percent to a low since the beginning of June.      Analyst Piral Dadhania of Canadian investment bank RBC sees the upper end of Puma's annual targets ""probably out of reach,"" according to a recent outlook. However, he remains optimistic about 2024./ag/ngu",© dpa-AFX - 2023,PUMA SE,PUM,DE0006969603,Equities,Footwear

According to the company, around half of the capital outflow is linked to a sharp increase in inventories that was not followed by an equally sharp increase in production. A further 30% of capital outflows are explained by delays in the UK Aventra program, while the remainder is explained by lower-than-expected order intake' says Stifel. For the year as a whole, the company now expects an improvement in FCF to -500/-700 million, compared with a VAe of 313 ME.Stifel also points out that sales amounted to 8.3 MdE, or -2.4% below a VAe of around 8.5 MdE, while orders of 8.4 MdE were -8.7% below the VAe of around 9.2 MdE.

After +8% in Q2, Stifel expects organic growth of 4.8% in Q3 (consensus is +5.4%). The analyst cites moderate growth in North America (+1% in Q3, after +2% in Q2) and more dynamic activity expected in Europe (+8.5%), Latin America (+12%) and Asia-Pacific (+5%).  We believe the mix will remain solid, driven by recent launches (Varilux XR, Ray-ban Reverse...) and by the continued strength of Stellest (myopia) lenses in China"", concludes the broker, who adds that Ray-Ban Meta lenses are expected to hit the shelves in mid-October.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

As a reminder, the company announced yesterday that it had been selected from a consortium as the winning candidate in the financing solicitation process launched by SAS.Air France-KLM's investment would amount to $144.5 million, of which $109.5 million in ordinary shares and $35 million in secured convertible bonds. In all, the consortium and the Danish government would invest $1.175 billion, of which $475 million in shares and $700 million in convertible bonds. On completion of the transaction, AFKL would hold a minority stake of up to 19.9% in SAS.  While it is still difficult to quantify the benefits of such an agreement, we feel that the investment is limited (1.8% of gross cash at the end of June) to obtain a stake in a strong brand that will have been able to upgrade its cost base by going through the Chapter 11 process', analyzes Oddo BHF. The analyst is now waiting for the Investor Day scheduled for November 7 to initiate a possible rerating of the share. In the meantime, the analyst continues to prefer Ryanair in the sector.

According to analyst James Goodman, this is particularly true for measurement technology and geoanalytics specialist Hexagon and construction software provider Nemetschek.      However, the earnings potential for the majority of the shares is limited in view of the continuing difficult economic environment, according to a sector study published on Tuesday. Therefore, Goodman only upgraded the two shares from ""Underweight"" to ""Equal Weight"". He left the price targets at 100 Swedish kronor and 60 euros, respectively. He thus grants Nemetschek a potential of around two percent based on Monday's closing price - which the share exploited on Tuesday.      After a decent first half of the year, rising interest rates and the fading hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) have weighed on technology stocks worldwide, Goodman explained. Hexagon was the worst hit in Europe, but Dassault, Nemetschek and Amadeus also saw double-digit percentage declines.      At Nemetschek, the analyst now noted a more resistant market environment. The headwind from the second quarter, caused for example by orders being brought forward, should no longer have such a strong impact on the third quarter, which Nemetschek will report on October 26.      Goodman does expect another weak quarter. But the expected acceleration of growth in the final quarter and the outlook for 2024, which is not as bad as feared, make the ratio of opportunities to risks appear more balanced. He also assessed the risks to the double-digit percentage increase in sales targeted for the current year as lower than originally thought.      For Teamviewer, the expert raised the earnings estimates due to the announced end as main sponsor with the English soccer club Manchester United. He raised the price target from 17 to 18 euros, which implies a potential of almost 14 percent on yesterday's closing price. The securities of the remote maintenance software specialist continue to be rated ""Overweight"", as do those of SAP.      In line with the ""Equal Weight"" rating, the analysts at Barclays Capital expect the share to develop more or less in line with the other stocks in the sector under review over the next twelve months. In the case of ""Overweight"", the analysts expect an above-average development compared to the sector./gl/tih/jha/      Publication of the original study: 02.10.2023 / 14:57 / GMT First disclosure of the original study: 03.10.2023 / 04:10 / GMT  Analyzing Institute Barclays Capital.",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Nemetschek SE,NEM,DE0006452907,Equities,Software

Adidas was among the biggest winners in the slightly recovered Dax with a 5.8 percent gain, while Puma shares led the MDax with a nearly six percent gain.      Nike shares themselves had already made strong gains in after-hours U.S. trading. The Americans disappointed the expectations of Wall Street analysts in terms of sales, but the gross margins turned out better than expected. In addition, according to Borsian, Nike made progress in reducing its high inventory levels - an issue where the German competition is currently also ""feeling the pinch"". In most cases, manufacturers have to offer high discounts. Adidas also still has to get rid of the remaining stocks of the ""Yeezy"" range after the end of the cooperation with the scandal rapper Kayne West.      Meanwhile, Jefferies expert James Grzinic wrote that Nike is in ""shining armor"", probably also alluding to its competitor Under Armour. He spoke of great relief at the first fiscal quarter report, which was much better than feared.      ""European competitors should benefit from the fact that the market leader is not experiencing any further negative surprises on the sales front,"" the expert continued. Gross margin, inventory reduction and Nike's slight sales increase forecast for its second fiscal quarter also send positive signals for further profit development at Adidas and Puma, Grzinic said.      According to experts at investment house Bryan Garnier, Nike's confirmed outlook for the full year also reassured investors. ""The modest revenue miss was not enough to dampen investors' positive sentiment after solid margin performance in the first quarter,"" they wrote in a research note available Friday. They believe the downward trend in market expectations seen in recent months should now stop. Nike shares should also benefit from robust consumer demand in China. However, Bryan Garnier also warned, ""Given the fragile mood of the U.S. consumer, black clouds are not far away.""/tav/ag/stk",© dpa-AFX - 2023,adidas AG,ADS,DE000A1EWWW0,Equities,Footwear

Financing is secured for FY22 at least, with no dilutive instruments in sight.
Crossject will release more detailed numbers for H1 23 before the end of October.FACTCrossject released H1 23 results.  Revenues reached €7,926k vs €3,374k, operating result €-6,535k vs €-6,959k, and net result €-4,462k vs €-5,874k. Gross cash at the end of H1 23 amounted to €5.4m vs €5.7m a year ago and €8m at the end of FY23.ANALYSISAs we regularly write, the numbers are of little relevance at this stage since the story of Crossject is based on the future launch of Zeneo. That said, we see as good news that the operating result is about the same as year. In short, the revenues are covering rising costs “as much” as last year, despite a strong increase in depreciation (+2.3m).
The cash burn looks reasonably contained even if net debt is not released at this stage (it includes a €1.2m tax receivable due to a delay in VAT reimbursement as well as an increase in inventories), so not bad news on that front (at least before we have more details) and the liquidity is preserved. Note the group has cashed in €8m from the €14m non-dilutive financing (bank debt). Note also that the group will publish a full set of accounts before the end of October, on which we will comment of course, and that will give even better visibility on Crossject’s financing going forward.
The successful audits in Europe and the US are also supporting the case. The former confirms that the group is getting nearer a clearance from US health authorities concerning the deal with BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority). H1 23 revenues include US$3.2m as part of this cooperation (note the contract could be worth US$155m in revenues in total for the French group). Also, see our Latest dated 20 June 2022 concerning the cooperation with BARDA.
More recently (July), we remind that the company announced the signing of an Australia & New Zealand commercial agreement for ZENEO® Midazolam (treatment of epileptic crisis) with AFT Pharmaceuticals, to cover this region of the world (i.e. a total population of around 30m). AFT is a listed New Zealand Pharma with sales of about NZS130m (c. €65m), addressing Australasia. AFT’s product portfolio comprises both proprietary and in-licensed products (skin care, supplements, allergy).IMPACTAll in all, this set of results looks ok, even if we lack the details on the accounts at this stage (to be released before the end of October; only a short simplified P&L has been made public so far). We will of course revert to these numbers for H1 23 once the full set of results is released, again before the end of October. Expect no change to our numbers at this stage.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Crossject,ALCJ,FR0011716265,Equities,"Medical Equipment, Supplies & Distribution"

In view of the extremely unpredictable economic situation worldwide, the leading managers in German companies are currently setting their targets rather conservatively, wrote analyst Michael Heider in a study published on Thursday.      Therefore, this time around twice as many companies are likely to exceed market expectations as there will be groups where annual targets are likely to be in jeopardy. According to Heider, he came to this conclusion after an intensive screening of the 200 stocks monitored by Warburg.      In his list, 11 companies with negative surprise potential are compared with 21 stocks with good prospects. According to the list, the sporting goods manufacturer Adidas, the cosmetics group Beiersdorf and Deutsche Borse should surprise positively from the Dax.      Surprisingly good results should also be achieved by Deutz, Drägerwerk, Elmos, Freenet, Fresenius Medical Care (FMC), Fuchs, Hugo Boss, Jost Werke, Jungheinrich, Kion, SFC Energy, Traton and Vectron from the MDax and SDax.      On the other hand, reports from leading index members Brenntag and Continental were negative, as were those from Adesso, HHLA, Hypoport, Lanxess, New Work, ProSiebenSat.1 and Secunet./tav/jcf/he",© dpa-AFX - 2023,adidas AG,ADS,DE000A1EWWW0,Equities,Footwear

ACTIONIDI announced today that it has completed, alongside Andera Partners, the sale of Flex Composite Group to Michelin. This operation, unveiled in June, will enable IDI to realise a capital gain of around €255m and to pocket close to €278m, corresponding to an investment multiple of 12 times the initial €23.2m outlay. Not only will this deal fill IDI’s pockets, it also further demonstrates IDI’s ongoing ability to create value.FACT
IDI made its first investment in Flex Composite Group for €23.2m back in 2015. 
At the end of 2022, IDI held 63.39% of the group alongside Andera Partners – a minority investor.
IDI and Andera Partners announced an agreement to sell the entire Flex Composite Group to Michelin for an enterprise value of €700m on 18 June 2023.
IDI and Andera Partners completed the sale agreement on 27 September 2023.
With this transaction, IDI achieves a multiple of 12x and an IRR of 38%.ANALYSISA masterstroke which radically changes IDI’s investment power
After announcing an agreement to sell Flex Composite Group alongside Andera Partners on 18 June, IDI reported today that it has completed the transaction. Flex Composite Group will join Michelin’s portfolio for an enterprise value of €700m. As a reminder, IDI acquired a stake in the group back in 2015 for €23.2m and holds, as of December 2022, 63.39% of the group alongside Andera Partners as a minority shareholder. With this operation, IDI will complete a stellar cash-on-cash multiple of 12x its initial investment, i.e. around €278m, corresponding to a capital gain of €255m and an IRR of 38%. This deal will therefore significantly line IDI’s pockets, enabling it to finance new investments. We estimate that, after this transaction, IDI should have a net cash position of around €352m.
Back to Flex Composite Group 
As mentioned in our last paper, Flex Composite Group is a European leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of advanced composite materials. The group is now made up of three divisions: i) Engineered fabrics, the technical coated fabrics division, ii) Carbon fabrics and technical composites Composite Materials, and iii) a thermoplastic films division, Technical Films, all of which have enabled it to achieve sales of c.€200m in 2022. Starting in 2015 up to 2022, through IDI’s support of its development, FCG has generated an operating margin of between 25% and 30% and average organic growth of 11%. 
Michelin’s acquisition of FCG and integration into its High Tech Materials division is in line with Michelin’s ambition to create a world leader in advanced composite materials. Michelin aims to combine the strengths of FCG and Michelin in R&D, but also geographically.
FY 2023 outlook 
Since 1 January 2023, IDI has completed or announced 14 transactions, including 5 disposals, 4 external growths and 5 acquisitions: the acquisition of a 40% stake in Omnes’ energy transition and innovation activities, the creation of 100% IdiCo (now fully consolidated), the disposal and subsequent reinvestment in Freeland, the investment in Natural Grass as well as in Prévost Laboratory Concept, and external growth transactions for Talis Education, CDS, and Groupe Positive. 
With a net cash position expected to reach €350m or so, IDI will have considerable firepower to finance new investments, and who knows, maybe redistribute some of the money through dividends. This is not unlikely as IDI has a focused investment strategy (less than 20 lines) and prefers its assets to fund their growth autonomously with IDI’s support only for bigger strategic deals. IMPACTWe will incorporate the capital gain from the sale of FCG into our estimates.

Deutsche Bank also said it expects next month's publication to be marked by a possible tightening - or even a slight upward revision - of the annual Ebitda targets communicated by the group.Edenred is scheduled to announce its 3rd quarter sales on October 19.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Jungheinrich even eased from the low since the beginning of January.       UBS expert Sven Weier believes that phase 1 of the turnaround at Kion appears to be almost complete. The next step is for order momentum to pick up, especially in the supply chain solutions (SCS) sector, Weier said. He attributes the recent share price weakness to weak purchasing managers' indices.

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/IDI-5352/news/IDI-Shielded-against-macro-economic-turmoil-44920675/,IDI  :  Shielded against macro-economic turmoil,"September 26, 2023 at 04:44 am EDT","Shielded against macro-economic turmoilEARNINGS/SALES RELEASESThe uncertain macro-economic environment has left IDI unscathed, with NAV growth of 12.4% in H1 23 to €97.73 per share. The first half was particularly active for IDI, which announced 14 transactions, including the sale of Flex Composite Group to Michelin for more than 12x IDI’s initial investment, representing an IRR of 38%. All in all, these are outstanding results for IDI, which ended H1 23 with shareholders’ equity of €730m (+8.6%), investment capacity of €74.1m, and net income of €77.5m (vs. €30.1m in H1 22).FACT
IDI’s NAV per share rose by 12.4% ytd to €97.73 compared to €86.95 at the end of 2022, bringing the NAV discount to 31% (from 42% in H1 22). On an absolute basis, NAV rose from €672.8m to €730.7m in H1 23. 
In H1 23, IDI’s shareholders’ equity reached €730m (+8.6% ytd) and IDI’s investment capacity (net of debt) amounted to €74.1m, plus an undrawn investment credit of €30m and an overdraft facility of €5m.
Ytd, IDI has announced 14 transactions: 5 disposals, 4 external growths and 5 new acquisitions. In particular, IDI and Andera Partners sold Flex Composite Group for an EV of €700m in June, representing an investment multiple of 12x IDI’s initial investment and an IRR of 38%. 
The net result (group share) came in at €77.5m in H1 23, substantially above the €30.1m reported the year before.ANALYSISA commendable performance in a persistently challenging environment
The persistently uncertain macro-economic environment failed to dampen IDI’s resilience in H1 23, with NAV per share up 12.4% ytd to €97.73 compared to €86.95 at the end of 2022. The positive development of NAV is explained by the solid operating performance of IDI’s investment portfolio and, above all, by the integration of the sale value of Flex Composite Group. A feat in a context of fast-declining valuations. 
H1 23 was a particularly busy period for IDI, which announced 14 transactions, including 5 disposals, 4 external growths and 5 acquisitions. IDI continues to thrive, as demonstrated by the main deal of Q2 23: the sale of Flex Composite Group to Michelin for an EV of €700m, i.e. 12x its initial investment and an IRR of 38%. Beyond this transaction, IDI also finalised i) the acquisition of 40% of Omnes’ energy transition and innovation activities, ii) the disposal and subsequent reinvestment in Freeland to MML for a cash on cash multiple of 2.2x and an IRR of 24%, and iii) the disposal of Fidinav, a group specialising in the maritime transport of dry bulk, for an IRR of 6%. IDI also acquired a significant minority stake in Natural Grass, a major European player in the hybrid turf market, and carried out two external growth operations for Talis, a network of post-baccalaureate schools. 
The solid performance of the private equity business, with the successful sale of Flex Composite Group enabled IDI to post a sizeable investment result of €89.5m compared with €34.4m in H1 22. 
Solid balance sheet to face the challenges ahead
As of June 2023, IDI’s balance sheet is stronger than ever, with equity of €730m up 8.6% ytd, crossing the €700m threshold. The group’s investment capacity remains healthy at €74.1m, with an additional €30m of undrawn investment credit and €5m of undrawn overdraft facility. As a reminder, the value of the sale of Flex Composite Group was included solely in the NAV and was not included in the group’s liquidity position. Including the sale of Flex Composite Group, IDI should be sitting on a considerable liquidity hoard, which should enable it to finance new investments.
Looking ahead to the full year 2023 
IDI had an excellent H1 23, with buoyant investment activity at a time when the private equity landscape was expected to be hit by the slowdown in dealflow and cutbacks in financing. As was the case in H1, H2 23 is looking particularly good for IDI, with five deals already in the pipeline or completed post-close including the acquisition of Prévost Laboratory Concept, the sale of B2B telecoms operator VOIP, two external growth deals and the winding-up of Dee Tech. 
Clearly, the macro-economic environment remains lacklustre for private equity players, whose valuations are likely to suffer from rising interest rates alongside persistently high inflation. Yet, with a discount to NAV of around 31% and an undeniable track record of creating value, we remain positive on the stock, which we believe is a long-term hold. IMPACTWe will revise our estimates in line with the H1 23 publication. Our figures will include the consolidation of IdiCo from 2023 and we will treat the stake in Omnes’ infrastructure business like the other financial investments. We will also include in our figures the capital gain on the sale of Flex Composite Group, which should boost our EPS for 2023.",© Alphavalue - 2023,IDI,IDIP,FR0000051393,Equities,Investment Management & Fund Operators

However, analyst Timothy Lee still sees significant upside potential for the Jungheinrich share. However, he considers the Kion share to be fairly valued, not least because its debt is higher than the industry average. This means that his assessment differs from that of the market, which considers the Frankfurt-based company to be undervalued following the share price slide last year, he wrote in two studies published on Friday.      Accordingly, he started Jungheinrich at ""Overweight"" with a price target of 36 euros. Lee took up the valuation of Kion shares with ""Equal Weight"" and a price target of 37 euros.      The Barclays analyst contrasted the two companies' warehouse automation business in particular. In general, a bottoming out is emerging here, from which Kion could benefit strongly as the global market leader in the event of a subsequent recovery. A further recovery in orders should take place in 2024, even if the Barclays expert does not yet expect such a rapid return to the levels seen before the Corona pandemic. As a result, his estimate for adjusted operating profitability in 2025 remains below consensus expectations.      At Jungheinrich, meanwhile, he sees a lot of potential in the still small but growing warehouse automation division, which has not yet been priced into the market. The acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group announced by the Hamburg-based company in January could increase the value of the business fourfold.      Lee also likes Jungheinrich's financial position better. He praised a strong balance sheet with manageable debt. Kion's debt level, on the other hand, is higher than its peers, he said. It should come down as sales and margins recover, but the Frankfurt-based company will still have to work hard to meet its obligations. It will take time for profitability to improve.      In the forklift business, Lee said both companies can rely on a strong order backlog. This should secure sales into 2024. In parallel, the analyst expects a gradual recovery in orders. Currently, the weak economic environment is weighing on both MDax companies. Jungheinrich is also very dependent on the European market and retail customers. At Kion, price increases should ensure stable margins in the rest of the year, but there is hardly any further upside potential here in 2024.      According to Barclays Capital, shares rated ""Overweight"" are likely to outperform the other stocks in the sector under review over the next twelve months. With an ""Equal Weight"" rating, the bank expects the stock to perform roughly in line with other sector stocks over the next twelve months./niw/ck/zb  Analyzing institute Barclays Capital.

The bank included the stock in its valuation with a buy recommendation ('Buy') and a price target of 65 euros. This would give the stock the potential to double in value.         A share investment in the delivery platform operator has been a rather nerve-racking affair in recent months. Since the beginning of the year, the stock has gone up and down. The result of all the fluctuations is sobering: the share price has lost almost 30 percent since the beginning of the year.     However, Hauck & Aufhäuser analyst Christian Salis was confident in a study presented on Wednesday that Delivery Hero will reap the rewards of its good positioning in the future. He said the company offers the most comprehensive online platform for meal delivery and benefits from its strong market position with over a hundred million customers in more than 70 countries - with the MDax member even being the market leader in 56 countries. This not only gives the delivery service major advantages, but also means a significant barrier to entry for competitors.      Salis also sees the focus on emerging markets as an advantage. The strong economic growth of the emerging nations and their pronounced affinity for the Internet are just as favorable as the lower intensity of competition. Added to this is the increasing urbanization of the emerging markets.       According to the industry expert, Delivery Hero should succeed in convincing with positive news in the future thanks to the efficiency measures taken.      Revenue growth had already begun to recover in the second quarter. Profitability should then also improve noticeably in the second half of the year. Hauck Aufhäuser therefore believes that the stock is a buy.      With its ""Buy"" rating, Hauck & Aufhäuser Investment Banking sees a sustained sees a sustainable upside potential of more than ten percent on a twelve-month horizon./mf/tav/mis  Analyzing institute Hauck Aufhäuser Investment Banking  Publication of the original study: 20.09.2023 / 07:17 GMT First disclosure of the original study: 20.09.2023 / 07:55 / GMT",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Delivery Hero SE,DHER,DE000A2E4K43,Equities,Internet Services

On Tradegate, the insurer's papers lost 5.6 percent to 62.15 euros.      With its capital increase of up to 300 million euros, the MDax group wants to drive up the proportion of its shares in free float and also increase its capital resources for further acquisitions and business growth from its own resources.

We were over-optimistic about top-line growth and now estimate sales of €702m with an underlying operating profit of 5%, compared with 6.1%. The downward revision comes mainly from the Chargeurs Advanced Materials division, where we were too enthusiastic about the prospects for a rebound in volumes in a macro-economic environment that remains unfavourable. We have also lowered our estimates for the Fashion Technologies division, which, despite the catch-up effect of the fashion and luxury goods sector, recorded a fall in sales in H1 due to the devaluation of the Argentinian peso. Top-line growth was also impacted by our downward revision of estimates for Chargeurs Luxury Fibers, whose growth was adversely affected by a cyclone in New Zealand. Lastly, our EPS forecasts were penalised by the rise in financial expenses in H1 23.CHANGE IN NAV€ 32.2 vs 41.1 -21.5%Given that we have based our NAV estimate on EV/EBITDA multiples with an average estimated EBITDA for 2023, 2024 and 2025, our downward revision of EBITDA particularly for Chargeurs Advanced Materials has penalised our NAV. We now value the division at around €300m, compared with €452m previously. The downward revision of the estimated EBITDA for Fashion Technology has also had a slight negative impact on our NAV. Lastly, the increase in net debt from €174.4m at the end of 2022 to €194.4m in H1 23 contributed to the fall in our NAV.CHANGE IN DCF€ 17.3 vs 26.3 -34.1%The sharp fall in our DCF comes from our downward revisions to the FY 23-24 EPS forecast (see EPS commentary). We expect revenues of €702m (vs. €789m) with an underlying profit of €35m for 2023 and revenues of €788m (vs. €872m) with an underlying operating profit of €49m (vs. €53m).

A team of analysts led by Bayer expert Gunther Zechmann looked at the efforts of freight forwarders and airlines to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a report published Friday. One quick way to do that, he said, is to switch to renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel. The first effect of that, he said, is the need for greater soybean acreage. Increasing soy volumes would benefit the agrochemical and pharmaceutical company, although a move away from corn would be negative for the Leverkusen-based company./tih/la      Publication of the original study: 14.09.2023 / 14:27 / UTC First transmission of the original study: 14.09.2023 / 23:00 / UTC----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Bayer AG,BAYN,DE000BAY0017,Equities,Pharmaceuticals

Meanwhile, Vivendi's share price remained virtually stable (+1%).  While the valuation of other assets, notably Canal+ Group and Havas, has no reason to have changed, this leads to an increase in the discount. We estimate this to be 55% at present"", stresses Oddo BHF. The broker believes that the current 'particularly low' level is attractive for taking a position on Vivendi.  Visibility on the speculative agenda is limited, but the strategic outcome remains unchanged in our view: Vivendi will be acquired, sooner or later, by Bolloré (and therefore at a premium, since Bolloré holds only 30% of the capital)', adds the analyst.

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CARREFOUR-4626/news/Carrefour-Oddo-BHF-confirms-its-outperform-recommendation-44845314/,CARREFOUR :  Oddo BHF confirms its 'outperform' recommendation,"September 14, 2023 at 10:17 am EDT","Oddo BHF maintains its outperform recommendation on Carrefour shares, with an unchanged target price of 20 euros, the day after the publication in bookshops of a book dedicated to the retailer.In 'Carrefour, la grande arnaque', Jérôme Coulombel, a former employee of the group, describes the franchising system as 'a way for Carrefour to extract value on the backs of its franchisees'. According to Oddo BHF, the main question raised by this book from an operational risk point of view is the Group's ability to continue recruiting franchisee candidates.  If the controversy were to take hold, the short-term financial risk would be that the Group would agree to redistribute a little value to disgruntled franchisees"", says the broker. The book also discusses negotiations with suppliers and certain tactics, some of which are reprehensible and condemned (such as RCD on the Carrefour side, or cartels on the supplier side). Finally, the book describes the loss of benefits linked to the transition from integrated to franchised stores, and the decline in the number of Carrefour employees in France. While this configuration may be reminiscent of the Orpéa case (a group of retirement homes which found itself at the center of a national controversy after the publication of an investigative book), the risks here are 'much less', according to Oddo BHF. The analyst points to the small number of potentially dissatisfied franchisees (a few hundred, according to the book), as well as Carrefour's financial situation, which is not as indebted as Orpéa was.

Concerns over Chinese competition could ease somewhat for European automakers, but there is a retaliation risk conversely, analyst Daniel Roeska wrote in a research note available Wednesday. Renault and Stellantis are likely to benefit particularly as mass-market manufacturers. It's more complicated for Volkswagen, he said, as the Wolfsburg-based company would be hit hardest by countermeasures. Premium manufacturers would also be worse off./tih/la  Publication of the original study: 13.09.2023 / 12:05 / UTC First disclosure of the original study: 13.09.2023 / 12:05 / UTC----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,BMW AG,BMW,DE0005190003,Equities,Auto & Truck Manufacturers

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CHARGEURS-5218/news/Chargeurs-Solace-in-museums-44824278/,CHARGEURS  :  Solace in museums,"September 12, 2023 at 09:24 am EDT","Solace in museumsEARNINGS/SALES RELEASESChargeurs reported results well below our expectations and aligned with consensus regarding both the top-line and profitability for H1 23, solely due to the cyclical weakness of the industrial protection film business. On the other hand, the Museum Studio division is firmly establishing itself as a group’s new growth lever within the Luxury division. Also worth noting is the good momentum of the group’s new growth drivers, which now account for nearly 60% of group revenue. The drop in profitability, compounded by a significant increase in financial expenses (net debt reaching €194.4m secured by ample credit lines), led to a sharp fall in the group’s net profit to €3.3m (vs. €10.2m).FACT
Chargeurs posted H1 total sales of €352.8m, down 12% organically yoy, driven by a 23.1% organic decline in Advanced Materials (new name for industrial protection film) sales to €146.7m and the pullback of Healthcare Solutions, now irrelevant. 
The Chargeurs Museum Studio division reported a strong increase in sales (+48.5% organic growth yoy) to €61.2m. 
In H1 23, Chargeurs reported a 44.5% fall in operating profit to €14.1m, against a consensus of €15.8m. 
Chargeurs recorded an increase in CFO to €4m versus €0.3m due to lower working capital requirements than in H1 22. 
After capital expenditures and dividends paid for FY-22, cash flow was down by €18m, bringing net debt to €194.4m at the close, corresponding to a leverage ratio of 3.5x. 
Despite these disappointing  results, Chargeurs cautiously expects a gradual rebound in its Advanced Materials division, which should enable it to achieve group global sales of €800m by 2024 and an EBITDA margin in the range of 9-10%.ANALYSISLet’s start by prefacing that Chargeurs Advanced Materials (CAM) division is a macro proxy. In 2021, the division had an exceptional year, with inventories built up by customers wishing to manage supply-chain disruptions in a post-COVID environment. CAM has since faced a significant destocking effect. Although the destocking trend seems to be over, industrial customers remain cautious about the near-term outlook with two pain points: construction at large and Germany. Group sales down 12% organically led to a 44.5% yoy fall in operating profit to €14.1m in H1 23.
Turbulent environment weighs on Chargeurs Advanced Materials 
Chargeurs Advanced Materials reported a 23.1% yoy organic decline in sales to €146.7m. The contraction in sales, in H1 23, was due to lower industrial volumes from customers in the context of energy and inflationary shocks. The division was also penalised by the crisis in the real estate and new construction markets (which account for 25% of its sales). As a result, CAM recorded a 74.4% fall in operating profit to €4.1m, although it successfully remainded positive thanks to a flexible organisation and a breakeven point lowered during recent years. Nevertheless, Chargeurs remains confident that business will inevitably pick up again, as the structural demand for industrial film protection is high and will be driven by i) the end of customer destocking, and ii) growth levers such as industrial equipment, renovation, mobility equipment, high-end household appliance and industrial building markets. It looks as if CAM has not pushed prices beyond the mix effects.
Fashion Technologies margin picks up again
While Chargeurs Fashion Technologies (CFT-PCC) excluding Healthcare Solutions recorded a slight decline in sales 1.3% lfl to €100.5m, the division posted a slight improvement in margin of 0.4ppt to 7.2%. CFT PCC benefited from a favourable customer/product mix coupled with pricing power that enabled it to pass on raw material and energy costs to customers. The division is clearly being pulled by technical textiles for the garment industry among the end-markets and pulled by profitability gains in the organisation.
Museum Studio gains ground as new growth driver
Chargeurs Museum Studio (CMS) achieved a clear beat on our expectations, with organic sales growth of 48.5% to €61.2m against €50.5m expected (€51.9m consensus). Top-line growth was driven by the gradual start-up of projects won in 2021 and 2022. The division’s operating income doubled in H1 23 (vs. H1 22) to €3.8m (vs. €1.8m), bringing the operating margin to 6.2% (up 1.2 ppt). The outlook is promising for the division, which should feel the full effect of the projects won in late 2021 and 2022, with deliveries by late 2023, 2024 and 2025. Chargeurs has confirmed its sales outlook of €120m for 2023 and €150m for 2024. This is an impressive achievement for a business started from scratch.
Chargeurs Personal Goods on the rise
Chargeurs Personal Goods, Chargeurs’ new division representing its ambition towards Quiet Luxury through Altesse Studio and Cambridge Satchel, got off to a good start with H1 23 sales of €4.1m and an operating margin of 4.9%. Chargeurs expects the group’s visibility to increase with i) the opening of Swaine’s flagship store on New Bond Street, London, in June, ii) the use of its products by the film industry, notably Indiana Jones’ Stetson for Swaine, and iii) the visibility linked to the coronation of King Charles III.
Luxury Fibers top-line affected by cyclone 
All is not rosy for the Luxury division, however, with a 25.2% yoy organic decline for Chargeurs Luxury Fibers (CLF) which was negatively impacted by the cyclone that struck New Zealand in February 2023. Despite the decline in top-line growth, CLF nonetheless reported an increase in operating profit to €1.2m, corresponding to margin growth of 1.2 ppt. The division continues to be driven by the roll-out of NATIVA, its blockchain based tracking tools and associated confidence about origins, which is increasingly relied upon by major brands.
A growing level of net debt
Despite the 32.7% drop in EBITDA to €24.9m, the reduction in working capital requirement to €3.2m (vs. €17.8m) led to cash flow generation from operations of €4m, compared with €0.3m in H1 22. However, after capex and the dividend paid for 2022, the net debt position deteriorated from €174.7m in FY-22 to €194.4m in H1 23, increasing the leverage ratio to 3.5x. In addition, the environment of rising interest rates coupled with hyperinflation in Argentina resulted in an increase in financial expenses from €8.8m to €12.4m.  Chargeurs’ average interest rate on its debt might end up being a significant 10% for 2023 (Chargeurs, on the other hand, expects it to be 5%), presumably as the price to pay for ample credit lines. 
In line with higher financial expenses and lower profitability, Chargeurs posted net income down 69% yoy in H1 23 to €3.3m.
A solid 2024 outlook
Assuming a gradual recovery in CAM, Chargeurs aims to achieve sales in excess of €800m in 2024 with an EBITDA margin of 9-10%. 
All in all, notwithstanding the decline in CAM and in the group’s industrial activities, we regard Chargeurs’ paradigm shift and premiumisation in a very positive light, as demand and margin shocks on CAM activities such as the one recorded in H1 23 would have been of much greater stress less than 10 years ago.IMPACTWe will be trimming our FY23 estimates, particularly for CAM, following this release.",© Alphavalue - 2023,Chargeurs,CRI,FR0000130692,Equities,Consumer Goods Conglomerates

Analyst Marcus Diebel not only put them on the ""Analyst Focus List"" of particularly interesting investment opportunities. With the status ""Positive Catalyst Watch"", the expert expects on top of that positive price drivers with the upcoming report on the third quarter.      The cooking box shipper is ""ready to exceed expectations,"" the expert stressed. He spoke of strong momentum in key business metrics (KPIs), low expectations and a still attractive valuation. The fundamental rating has been ""Overweight"" since April. At that time, Diebel had raised the stock by two investment levels. He had praised the planned expansion with ready meals.      With a price target raised from 31 to 38 euros in Tuesday's study, he sees further upside potential. The old price target had been reached last after a good run. In mid-June, the shares had still oscillated between 18 and 19 euros, but then they had started a rally of more than 70 percent.      His optimism for HelloFresh had been underpinned at a recent investor event in Berlin. He said management expects a strong second half of the year in terms of customer numbers and revenue and margin growth. This is also based on a new plant in the U.S. state of Arizona and a successful launch of ready-to-eat meals in European countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, he added. As a result, HelloFresh is also likely to take market share from caterers and canteens.      The expert raised his earnings expectations for 2023 and 2024. He was thus up to 10 percent more ambitious than the consensus, although his estimate was thus still well below Hellofresh's 2025 targets. The stock's upside potential pairs with an attractive valuation. He anticipates a strong third quarter and encouraging final quarter statements.      In line with its ""Overweight"" rating, JPMorgan expects the stock to outperform its respective sector over the next six to 12 months./tih/la/mis      Analyzing institute JPMorgan.

According to Oddo BHF, the day will provide an opportunity to review the implementation of the Group's strategy, with a particular focus on retail banking, Boursorama and specialized financial services. The expected evolution of the Group's capital should be at the heart of investors' attention. The Group is expected to explain the expected trajectory of its CET1 ratio, which stood at 13.0% at the end of last June on a fully loaded basis"", stresses the analyst, who believes that ""the policy of returning capital to shareholders should not be modified"".  Beyond the announcements of the next CMD, which we believe are already widely expected by the market, we believe that the re-rating of the share should come in the coming months from the prospects of a strong rebound in NI in 2024 and 2025"", adds the broker. Oddo BHF expects NI to rise by +35% and +14% respectively in 2024 and 2025, while the consensus is for +37% and +15%. Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

In the chart, the path to the record high from 2020 at a good 143 euros is clear.      On Thursday, SAP had announced that the software management company LeanIX will be acquired. According to UBS expert Michael Briest, the solutions of the purchased company should make it easier for SAP customers to switch to the cloud. In his current commentary, Briest considers the possible valuation of 1.2 billion euros calculated by ""Handelsblatt"" to be plausible.       With a stock market value of just over 160 billion euros, SAP is by far the most valuable group in Germany. Siemens and Airbus follow in second and third place with just under 108 billion euros and 106 billion euros respectively. SAP has gained a lead of more than 60 percent since the interim low at the end of September./ag/zb",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Siemens AG,SIE,DE0007236101,Equities,Electrical Components & Equipment

The analyst reports that net income came to 15.5 ME in the 1st half (vs. 12.5 ME in H1 22), benefiting in particular from the rise in investment income from 0.5 ME to 3.8 ME, thanks to higher interest rates.Although operating income came in at 17.8 ME - a little below expectations - the analyst believes that ""the amounts are small enough to be of little significance in terms of a real disappointment, and without any real consequences..."".According to Oddo BHF, the stock market issue is elsewhere, since a proposed takeover bid is underway (50 E or 39.64 E after payment of the 10.36 E dividend). What's at stake is more a question of blocking any withdrawal that certain shareholders might attempt, rather than momentum or the 2023 earnings sequence. Against this backdrop, Oddo BHF is raising its price target to reflect the fact that the stock is worth more than the current draft offer price. Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Wainwright initiated coverage of Sensorion shares this week, with a Buy recommendation and a target of three euros.In a research note published on Tuesday, the US research firm praises Sensorion's positioning in the hearing loss treatment market, which it believes has been strengthened by recent clinical studies and new financing.In its study, the research firm particularly hails the entry into the capital of Redmile, a Californian investor in the healthcare sector, now the company's largest shareholder.According to H.C. Wainwright, the arrival of this 'reference' investor sends a positive signal to the market, and could lead to the arrival of other US-based investors in the near future.The analyst also notes that two of Sensorion's direct competitor biotechs have very recently been acquired by 'big pharmas', namely Akouos taken over by Eli Lilly at the end of 2022, and Decibel acquired by Regeneron last month.For Wainwright, these transactions reinforce Sensorion's status as a potential takeover target, with the research firm considering Novartis as the most likely acquirer given its strong presence in Europe and its expertise in hearing loss and gene therapies.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

Analyst Bruno Monteyne dealt with the costs that a turn towards ""sustainable Palmol"" would have in a study on the household and consumer goods sector available on Wednesday. Contrary to what many companies claim, Palmol's sourcing has not been sustainable to date, he said. In the medium term, the so-called RSPO certification (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil) would have to be expanded with additional factors such as traceability and reforestation. This will eat into the profit margins of many companies. In the long term, the cost pressure will be even higher, as companies will sooner or later look for more expensive alternatives to palm oil. Reasons include rising prices for vegetable oils and lower yields due to climate change./ck/mis/la      Publication of the original study: 05.09.2023 / 16:20 / UTC  First disclosure of the original study: 06.09.2023 / 04:00 / UTC----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Beiersdorf,BEI,DE0005200000,Equities,Personal Products

As a reminder, Vallourec has decided to launch a process to sell or close its production units in Germany by the end of 2021"", says the analyst, who points out that deleveraging is accelerating.  In Q2 23, net debt stood at 868 ME (around 1 MdE at the end of Q1 23 and 2.2 MdE at the end of 2020, before the financial restructuring) and Vallourec expects further deleveraging in H2 23', continues the broker. According to Oddo BHF, the Group could take advantage of this deleveraging to communicate on its future shareholder return policy, since Vallourec has not paid a dividend for almost 10 years.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.

  Orsted continues to suffer a hangover from last week's large writedowns, with shares down 8% on Tuesday after credit rating agency Moody's downgraded the company's outlook to negative from stable. 

  The Danish energy company said on Aug. 30 that it would be taking impairments of up to 16 billion Danish kroner ($2.32 billion), mainly related to U.S. offshore wind projects, which sent its shares down 25% on the day. 

  Moody's said Tuesday that the projects haven't yet been given the go-ahead to proceed, but if they do, capital expenditure to build them will likely be higher and future internal rates of return will likely be lower than previously expected. 

  ""Whereas the impairments don't change the company's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization guidance or expected investment levels in 2023, Moody's expects the headwinds that Orsted is currently facing in the U.S. to lead to its credit metrics being weakly positioned at least until the end of 2025,"" it said.

Thus, Goel expects them to underperform in the coming twelve months compared to other stocks in the banking sector. He also cut his price target from 12.50 euros to 10.80 euros.      In particular, the Barclays analyst expects net interest income to fall in Commerzbank's core business in 2024, as key interest rates have now stabilized after their sharp rise. Commerzbank has been a big beneficiary of rising interest rates so far, he said. Now, however, the risks outweighed the opportunities, although the stock's valuation still appeared undemanding. Goel's estimates for Commerzbank's earnings development in 2024 and 2025, for example, are around ten percent below the consensus estimates.      According to the Barclays expert, Commerzbank is likely to publish its medium-term targets for the period after 2024 at the beginning of November, with the figures for the third quarter. While this is certainly interesting, he does not expect any positive surprises.      On average, a return on equity (RoTE) of 9 to 10 percent is already expected for 2025, but ""such a profitability level would still be below the industry average and is also highly dependent on the development of interest rates,"" he qualifies.      With regard to capital distributions, Goel is also critical of the fact that Commerzbank is not in a position to distribute more than 50 percent of its 2023 profit, part of which will also be returned by the end of the year in the form of share buybacks. In the medium term, distributions are likely to rise to 70 percent, but he sees ""no positive surprise"" in this either./ck/mis/jha/      Publication of the original study: 04.09.2023 / 23:12 / GMT First circulation of the original study: 05.09.2023 / 04:10 / GMT",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Commerzbank AG,CBK,DE000CBK1001,Equities,Banks

The long-term outlook for the capital goods sector remains good, but investors should be prepared for a ""hiccup"" in the third quarter in the wake of a post-Corona normalization, analyst Nicholas Green wrote in an industry report available Monday. That's when orders are likely to fall in many sectors and price momentum will slow. In this environment, investors should focus on companies active in the electrical engineering and automation and software sectors. Here, Siemens is the most broadly positioned. Other favorites are Schneider Electric and Legrand because of their focus on the renewal of electrical engineering. ABB, on the other hand, first needs clearer communication in terms of strategy and software. The expert remains cautious on Siemens Energy due to the burdens from Gamesa and on Kion, as the growth expectations of many investors are too high here and the debt ratio has risen./mis/la  Publication of the original study: 02.09.2023 / 14:05 / UTC First disclosure of the original study: 04.09.2023 / 05:00 / UTC----------------------- dpa-AFX Broker - the Trader News from dpa-AFX-----------------------",© dpa-AFX - 2023,Siemens AG,SIE,DE0007236101,Equities,Electrical Components & Equipment
