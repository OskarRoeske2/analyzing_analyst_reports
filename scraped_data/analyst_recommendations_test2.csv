Announces Positive Clinical Activity Data for VRDN-001","September 10, 2024 at 07:11 am EDT","Viridian Therapeutics, Inc. announced on September 10, 2024, the company issued a press release announcing topline data from a phase 3 randomized trial of VRDN-001 (or veligrotug), a differentiated humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IGF-1R, in active thyroid eye disease (TED), which the company refers to as the THRIVE trial. THRIVE Clinical Activity Data: THRIVE met the primary and all secondary endpoints at 15 weeks after five infusions of veligrotug, showing highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001) improvements on all of the measured signs and symptoms of TED. Veligrotug additionally showed a rapid onset of action, with the majority (53%) of veligrotug-treated patients achieving a proptosis response after just one infusion, or three weeks after start of therapy.THRIVE enrolled 113 patients, randomized to veligrotug (n=75) and placebo (n=38). Patients receiving veligrotug had statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements across the following key disease endpoints at the primary efficacy analysis timepoint of 15 weeks: Proptosis: Proptosis Responder Rate: 70% proptosis responder rate (?PRR?) in patients receiving veligrotug, compared with 5% of patients receiving placebo (64% placebo-adjusted) (p < 0.0001). PRR is defined as at least a 2-millimeter (?mm?) reduction in proptosis from baseline in the study eye without worsening in the fellow eye (=2 mm increase), as measured by exophthalmometry; Proptosis Mean Reduction: 2.9 mm mean reduction in proptosis from baseline in patients receiving veligrotug, compared with 0.5mm reduction in patients receiving placebo (2.4mm placebo-adjusted) (p < 0.0001), as measured by exophthalmometry.Diplopia: Diplopia Complete Resolution: 54% complete resolution of diplopia in patients receiving veligrotug, compared with 12% of patients receiving placebo (43% placebo-adjusted) (p < 0.0001). Diplopia resolution is defined by patients achieving a score of 0 on the Gorman subjective diplopia scale at week 15, among patients with diplopia at baseline (n=76); Diplopia Response: 63% achieved a diplopia response in patients receiving veligrotug, compared with 20% of patients receiving placebo (43% placebo-adjusted) (p < 0.0001). Diplopia response is defined by patients achieving a reduction of at least 1 on the Gorman subjective diplopia scale at week 15, among patients with diplopia at baseline.Clinical Activity Score (CAS): CAS Reduction to 0 or 1: 64% of patients receiving veligrotug achieved maximal or near-maximal therapeutic effect on CAS, compared with 18% of patients receiving placebo (46% placebo-adjusted) (p < 0.0001), defined as reaching a CAS of 0 or 1. CAS measures inflammatory signs and symptoms of TED, providing a composite score of pain, as well as redness and swelling of the eyelids and conjunctiva, on a scale from 0 to 7; CAS Mean Reduction: 3.4-point mean reduction in CAS from baseline for patients receiving veligrotug, compared with 1.7-point reduction in patients receiving placebo (1.7-point placebo-adjusted) (p < 0.0001). Overall Response: Overall Responder Rate: 67% of patients receiving veligrotug achieved an overall response, compared with 5% of patients receiving placebo (61% placebo-adjusted) (p < 0.0001). Overall Responder Rate is defined as achieving a proptosis response and a =2-point reduction in CAS from baseline without worsening in the fellow eye in either proptosis (2mm increase) or CAS (2-point increase).THRIVE Safety Data: Generally Well-Tolerated: Veligrotug was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with previous veligrotug studies. The majority of adverse events (AEs) were mild, and there was a low rate (4%) of discontinuations in the veligrotug arm. There were no treatment-related serious AEs.Low Rate of Hearing Impairment: There was a 5.5% placebo-adjusted rate of hearing impairment AEs in THRIVE (16% incidence in patients receiving veligrotug, compared with 10.5% incidence in patients receiving placebo). Clinical Update: The Company also announced that the second phase 3 clinical trial of veligrotug, THRIVE-2, in patients with chronic TED is ongoing. Viridian completed enrollment of THRIVE-2 in July 2024, and topline data readout is on track for year-end 2024.Viridian anticipates submitting a biologics license application (BLA) for veligrotug for the treatment of TED in the second half of 2025, as planned. The company believes these topline results from THRIVE provide strong support for a potential best-in-class profile of VRDN-003, an IGF-1R antibody with the same binding domain as veligrotug, with the potential to deliver clinical efficacy and safety consistent with veligrotug in a low-volume, infrequent, self-administered, subcutaneous injection that patients take at home. Viridian initiated two global Phase 3 clinical trials for VRDN-003 in August 2024 as planned: REVEAL-1 and REVEAL-2 in active and chronic TED, respectively.Both trials will evaluate VRDN-003 subcutaneously administered every four weeks or eight weeks and will assess outcomes versus placebo. Viridian anticipates topline data from both trials in the first half of 2026, with a BLA submission for VRDN-003 for the treatment of TED by year-end 2026.",© S&P Capital IQ - 2024,"Viridian Therapeutics, Inc.",VRDN,US92790C1045,Equities,Biotechnology & Medical Research

              The Texas-based firm's cloud business - viewed as a less expensive option to leaders Microsoft and Amazon - has seen rapid adoption due to integration of artificial intelligence.
              Oracle's cloud services revenue rose 21% to $5.6 billion in the first quarter. Its overall revenue of $13.31 billion beat estimates of $13.23 billion.
              ""Q1 results were good overall and remain fundamentally positive on certain aspects of Oracle's narrative, particularly Oracle's ability to capitalize on AI training-related opportunities,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a note.
              Oracle's shares have risen more than 32% this year, while Microsoft and Amazon have added 8% and 15%, respectively. 
              Oracle's cloud infrastructure is also powered by Nvidia's hardware, widely considered the gold standard for AI semiconductors.
              The company is also partnering with rival cloud service providers to make it simpler for its customers to connect their data across vendors. On Monday, it announced a tie-up with Amazon Web Services, after having signed a similar one with Alphabet's Google Cloud in June.
              ""Now with the help of all big three (Azure, Google Cloud and now AWS joining force), we will continue to observe a nice cloud revenue lift as well as growth acceleration thanks to the multi-cloud partnership,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note.

              Small and mid-size banks have been ramping up dealmaking to strengthen their balance sheets and compete with rivals more effectively. 
              As of mid-August, banks with assets between $10 billion and $100 billion had struck 38 deals compared with 29 during the same period last year, according to Dealogic data.
              NBT's assets totaled $13.50 billion as of June 30, while Evans had $2.26 billion of assets at the same time.    
              Banks have been looking to reduce deposit concentration via mergers since a more diversified depositor base improves stability and reduces risks to profitability, said Kris Mitchener, professor of economics at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University.
              The latest deal will allow NBT to gain market share in Buffalo and Rochester, it said on Monday. Currently, it primarily serves customers in upstate New York areas of Norwich, Syracuse, Oneonta and others. It is also present in Pennsylvania, Vermont and Massachusetts. 
              NBT was formed in 1856 and is a big lender to businesses. More than half of its loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans as of the second quarter.
              Under the terms of the deal, Evans' investors will get 0.91 of NBT shares for each share they own. After the deal, which is  expected to close in the first half of next year, Evans' CEO David Nasca will join NBT's board.

  Alibaba Group's shares surged in Hong Kong on expectations that easier access to mainland investors may boost demand for the e-commerce giant's stock. 

  Shares rose 4.7% to 81.95 Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to US$10.51, early Tuesday. The stock was the top gainer on the benchmark Hang Seng Index and outperformed the index, which was recently up 0.2%. 

  The gains came after Alibaba Group's Hong Kong shares were included by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in the Stock Connect scheme. 

  Stock Connect is a platform linking Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges with Hong Kong's bourse that allows mainland investors to trade eligible Hong Kong shares. 

  The Southbound Stock Connect inclusion will attract new buying interest for the stocks from mainland-based investors, Daiwa analysts said. 

  Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note that the inclusion of Alibaba in the stock connect could attract around $2 billion to $3 billion of mainland liquidity by the end of this year. 

  Over a two to three-year period, total inflows could reach $11 billion, following the liquidity trajectory of its peers Tencent, Meituan, and Xiaomi, Goldman Sachs analysts said. 

  Alibaba is the largest company in terms of market capitalization among the 13 companies that have secondary listings in Hong Kong. As of Sept. 9, Southbound shareholding accounted for 10% of Tencent's total Hong Kong share, 14.5% for Xiaomi, and 12.8% for Meituan, according to data provider Wind. 

  Although Chinese equities have faced challenging market liquidity amid stricter market regulations and weak faith in the country's economy, southbound net buying has been ""exceptionally strong,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said. 

  Alibaba's Hong Kong shares have risen 8.0% so far this year.

Diamondback and Endeavor will merge in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of Endeavor?s net debt. The transaction consideration will consist of approximately 117.3 million shares of Diamondback common stock and $8 billion of cash, subject to customary adjustments. The cash portion of the consideration is expected to be funded through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under Diamondback?s credit facility and/or proceeds from term loans and senior notes offerings. Citi committed to provide a $8 billion senior unsecured bridge facility to finance the transaction. On February 29, 2024, Diamondback entered into the takeout facility and pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Commitment Letter, the commitments with respect to the bridge facility were reduced to $6.5 billion and certain other financing institutions joined. Diamondback has received commitments for the extension of a senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.5 billion, consisting of a 1 year, $1 billion tranche and a 2 year, $500 million tranche. As result of the transaction, Diamondback?s existing stockholders are expected to own approximately 60.5% of the combined company and Endeavor?s equity holders are expected to own approximately 39.5% of the combined company. The combination will create a premier Permian independent operator. The combined company will continue to be headquartered in Midland, Texas. At closing, Diamondback will enter into a stockholders agreement with the former equity holders of Endeavor. Under that agreement the former Endeavor equity holders will be subject to certain standstill, voting and transfer restrictions and will be provided with certain director nominations rights and customary registration rights with respect to the shares of Diamondback common stock issued to them as transaction consideration. In case of termination of transaction under certain circumstances, Diamondback would be required to pay $1.4 billion termination fee to Endeavor. Upon closing, Diamondback?s Board of Directors will expand to 13 members and Charles Meloy and Lance Robertson, together with two other individuals mutually agreed upon by Diamondback and Endeavor, will be added to the Board of Directors.

              (Reuters) -Vista Outdoor said on Tuesday it has not yet decided on the latest buyout offer from MNC Capital and delayed its special investor meet to vote on a separate deal to sell its ammunition unit to defense firm Czechoslovak Group (CSG).
              The investment firm had over the weekend raised its per share offer by $1, valuing Vista at $2.51 billion, but gave a tight deadline that expired on Monday.
              MNC entered the race in March when it first offered $2.9 billion for Vista, which was then planning to sell its sporting goods business.
              Vista shares were then trading at a much higher price than its current value of about $38. 
              Both MNC and CSG have been locked in a long bidding war for Vista, which divided its performance gear and ammunition businesses into two separate units in 2022.
              Meanwhile, CSG signed a $2.15 billion deal for the ammunition unit, Kinetic Group, in July after raising the offer several times.
              Vista said on Tuesday the investor meet will take place on Sept. 27 instead of Sept. 13, as it ""intends to continue to constructively engage with MNC"".
              Still, the company reiterated its shareholder recommendation in favor of the CSG deal. Its shares were up about 3% in morning trading.

Anaergia is now engaged as a technology supplier in Phase 2 of the upgrade for the complete-mix digester tank. The SCAD project at MS U plays a critical role in effective manure management and eliminates the need for open-air storage of manure, significantly reducing the odors and methane emissions associated with land-applied liquid manure, while also enhancing the value derived from both manure and food waste.It recoups value from the waste streams by utilizing a series of technologically advanced solutions. These include Anaergia's high throughput Omnivore?? AD system that Anaergia delivered under a design-build contract completed in 2014.This facility converts food waste from campus dining halls, manure from MSU's dairy farm and food processing waste from the local community into 380 kW of electricity which is used to power a number of the buildings on MSU's campus.

The Group is therefore revising its Auto 2024 guidance downwards, anticipating ""slightly lower"" volumes (i.e. a range of -1 to -5% according to the Group's definition) vs. ""slightly higher"" volumes, as well as an EBIT margin of 6 to 7% vs. 8 to 10% previously.""Overall, having aligned ourselves with the mid-range of the guidance, we are adjusting our 2024 EBIT downwards by 20%, placing us 18% below the pre-announcement consensus"", says Oddo BHF.  It should be noted that it is difficult to interpret this profit warning clearly, since the Group has not specified the portion attributable to the braking system problem and the portion attributable to the environment in China', points out the broker.Copyright (c) 2024 CercleFinance.com.
