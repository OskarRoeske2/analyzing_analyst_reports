UBS has reaffirmed its 'buy' recommendation on Rémy Cointreau, with its price target maintained at 195 euros, a target that implies a 13% upside potential for the wine and spirits house's stock.'Strong brand equity and consumption oriented towards high-income drinkers should make Remy Martin more resilient as we enter a recessionary environment', the broker judges in the summary of its note.For its part, Stifel anticipates the announcement, on January 27, of a decline of around 6% in organic sales in the third accounting quarter, dragged down by cognac in the United States due to the ongoing realignment of sales and a strong basis for comparison.The company has the highest exposure to China among our main European peers, which should finally pay off despite the disruption resulting from the policy reversal on the Covid zero,"" he notes.While reiterating its 'buy' recommendation on Rémy Cointreau, considering that an 'attractive entry point allows for patience', Stifel adjusts its price target from 200 to 197 euros to take into account a weaker dollar.Copyright (c) 2023 CercleFinance.com.
