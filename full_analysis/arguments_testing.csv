0,0,1,"BOTTOM LINE We and almost every other investor we have spoken to over the years, has been framing the AMZN SOTP valuation wrong. Amazon advertising is only 5 of revenues, but is far greater contributor to overall nonAWS EBIT margins than the street recognizes. Said differently, If advertising was viewed as a standalong business unit we will explain why it shouldnt be, it would represent well north of 300 of 2020E nonAWS EBIT.","{""Valuation"": ""negative"", ""Advertising"": ""positive"", ""EBIT Margins"": ""positive"", ""Business Unit"": ""neutral""}"
1,1,1,"Based on our view that there is massive upside by 2024E, we increase our PT to a Street high of 4,500 based on an average of our 2024 SOTP and 30x our 2024 EBIT power of 91bn vs. our inprint estimates of 71.5bn and the street at 69bn both of these are modeled back at 10, Overall, we think Previous BUY investors are materially underestimating the earnings power of the business. We are going to be good bulls not all our colleagues always are and not factor all of the goodness in our estimates. We wanted to frame a highly likely outcome, as well as dynamics of the AMZN business that we this not totally Previous 3,925 appreciated. As a long time buysider, I think one of the most important values the sellside can bring is reframing an underappreciated dynamic.

2,2,1,"We would highlight that this is not a shortterm call. We do think Street estimates for fulfillment in particular are modeled too low in H121 based on the companys message that they are embarking on another fulfillment center investment cycle made loud and clear in our view on the 2Q20 call. Also, we all know eCommerce has seen a massive acceleration from the pandemic, but can imagine guiding could be challenging.

3,3,1,"Everybody who is using a SOTP model for AMZN is doing so incorrectly ourselves too. We also are not huge fan of SOTP models because the Buyside or Sellside makes inaccurate conclusions, but in AMZNs case think is necessary. Why we are not a fan These SOTP analyses are often done as means to justify that a company is worth more than it is currently trading at, but let us be clear. Analysts may lie the market doesnt lie and the associated price a stock currently trades at is what it is. It can turn out to be true, taking the case of Icahns successful push to separate PYPL from EBAY. We would argue there are a lot more reasons that untethered from EBAY, PYPL has been able to transform into a different business than it would if still owned by EBAY. But back to our initial point, analysts may lie stocks dont lie. Massive kudos to whomever bet alongside Mr. Icahn, but this has been a grand slam home run, with PYPL alone at a 230bn mkt cap. We do not remotely subscribe to the thesis that AWS profits highly profitable and quantifiable are being used to subsidize retail losses.","{""Stock Valuation"": ""neutral"", ""Analyst Credibility"": ""negative"", ""Business Transformation"": ""positive"", ""Cost Management"": ""neutral"", ""Profitability"": ""neutral""}"
4,4,1,"SOTP debates aside, we would all concur that more disclosure is better than less disclosure. This typically leads to multiple expansion given investors greater understanding of the different moving pieces of complex businesses. Examples we would cite are BABA cloud and offline have been huge drags on a highly profitable core business, NFLX domestic is highly profitable vs international, and GOOG most recently took a cue from some of these other megacaps.

5,5,1,"Now lets chitty chat AMZN. We think the street often tries to ascribe different multiples to AWS they certainly should, advertising, subscription, FBA, GMV, 1p revs, 3p revs etc. You name it, somebody has done it.

9,9,1,"We would advocate the investors should essentially look at the business in two primary buckets AWS and Everything Else So why do we think so? AMZN is probably the company that penned the term Flywheel or certainly made it pervasive in the investment and operating communities. What do we mean? Lets start to dissect by reporting line. Retail The 1p and 3p businesses, while with different margin structures 3p is much higher and reported only as the net take, are intimately intertwined. They benefit from the same endcustomer base. With FBAs continued expansion and penetration as a of the 3P business, they often share the same warehouse space, as well as the same logisticsdelivery providers. They share the same payment processing and benefit from the same marketing. We have long put zero stock in trying to look at one vs. the other. FBA increasing as of the mix is good for retail margins and AMZNs take rate, but to our SOTP comment, we are not going to try and put a different multiple on one vs. the other. Subscription Prime Sweet Sweet AMZN Prime. While we get that investors love subscription businesses because they are sticky, recurring, and have much greater degrees of predictability, AMZN Prime is all about the flywheel. There may be a small base of Audible users or more on the come with its recent Luna Cloud gaming service announcement, but end of the day the subscription business at 19.2bn in 2019 is all about Prime. Back to our Flywheel comment, the Prime business exists because of the robust selection, and value proposition it represents to end consumers. And to further sweeten the deal, AMZN over the last 57 years has only further increased the value of a prime subscription by including an increasingly robust offering of streaming video, streaming audio and most recently, 1day shipping. On the other side of the network effect, the larger the Prime subscriber base, the more enfranchised sellers are in participating in AMZNs FBA Fulfillment by Amazon program. Having the Prime Enabled logo next to your item, is a key driver to a shoppers propensity to click. So back to our comments about Retail, Prime and Retail are intimately intertwined. Within that context, we think ascribing a value to Subscription in SOTP separately also makes no sense Advertising As we have framed in our earlier notes about AMZNs ad business, 1 We think they are the only online player really benefiting from trade budgets today, 2 We believe there was an evolution internally in which AMZN found the right advertising business for AMZN. We estimate at least 8590 of the AMZN business today is sponsored listings. In this scenario, an advertiser pays for higher placement within the product sort order, the user stays on AMZN, and AMZN keeps the transaction and transaction data. To use CPG as an example we think by far the largest advertiser vertical on AMZN, we think PG, Unilever, Energizer companies that dont have a real DTC strategy view advertising on AMZN to be not so different than paying for favorable shelf placement at WMT, TGT, KR, etc. The reality is, this is a where their customers are, b has better quantifiable results than the offline analog, so have been happy participants. We think that AMZN could become more aggressive with AMZN Firepotentially giving the TV device away to further drive their video inventory, but think that this hasnt happened yet but who knows prime day is around the bend, but a development worth closely watching. Similar to Retail and Prime, we think investors have potentially thought through the Ad business as being a separate business unit, but we think that it sits under the broader retail umbrella to a greater degree than investors recognize. The ad business doesnt exist without retail.","{""Cost Management"": ""positive"", ""Business Model"": ""positive"", ""Subscription Service"": ""positive"", ""Logistics"": ""neutral"", ""Marketing Strategy"": ""positive"", ""Payment Processing"": ""neutral"", ""Growth Strategy"": ""positive"", ""Customer Base"": ""positive"", ""Product Offering"": ""positive"", ""Advertising Business"": ""positive"", ""Retail Operations"": ""positive"", ""Network Effect"": ""positive"", ""Value Proposition"": ""positive""}"
10,10,1,"So why does this all matter? Lets do a little fun math. 1 FY 2015 North America margin was 4.3, international was 0.3 2 The FY 2015 Other revenue line in totality was 1.7bn with advertising likely 1.21.3bn, 3 Street estimated GAAP EBIT is 69bn for 2024 In our view, 2016 was the year advertising had the real break out with Other revenues growing 74 yy and advertising growing, we estimate, 90 yy. For context, our estimate of advertising was 13.8bn in 2019, growing 41 yy to 19.4bn in 2020. Now this is where it gets interesting based on our channel work, and some common sense, we estimate that advertising EBIT margins if it were a stand alone are north of 80, and believe that could even be CONSERVATIVE. Running this math based on 2019 actuals, NonAWS EBIT was 5.3bn, and","{""Revenue Growth"": ""positive"", ""Margin Expansion"": ""positive"", ""Earnings Performance"": ""positive"", ""Cost Management"": ""positive""}"
11,11,1,"Advertising if looked in isolation would be 11bn implying that the rest of the business is losing money??!?!?!?!?! We actually think of this as a huge positive not a negative. As we stated under bullet 4, we think that there is AWS and Everything Else so we look at advertising as another part of the Flywheel. Valuation is often more of an artform than pure science, but end of the day what matters is what is the underlying earnings potential of the business. In our view, we think the key exercise for valuing AMZN, is to do is the following Take AWS Revenues and EBIT estimates for 2024 newly published today we are at 100bn in revenues and 34.5bn in OI Assume the standalone advertising business does 52bn and an estimated margin of 75 lets assume they do more around CTVFire TV so the margin goes down from predominantly sponsored products, that is 39bn! So combined, between these two lines, we are already at 73.5bn in EBIT If we assume that the nonad components of the north American retail biz are able to get back to a 4 EBIT margin as they were in 2015 North America was 4.3, we would get on our estimates of retail revenues of 19.5bn All in, this is 93bn of EBIT Earnings Power vs the street at 69bn 14 EBIT margins vs the street at 10 Assuming we are correct, by 2024 investors wont need to do these financial acrobatics, because the underlying report EBIT of the busines will show up flowing through the income statement.","{""Valuation"": ""neutral"", ""Earnings Power"": ""positive"", ""Cost Management"": ""positive"", ""Business Model"": ""positive"", ""Revenue Growth"": ""positive"", ""Margin Expansion"": ""positive""}"
12,12,1,"Lets entertain the negative side and see where we could be wrong. Do you mean to say AMZN is back to its old days of selling things at a loss? And dont they always find a way to keep spending? Well yes and no. We think this comparison to 2015 margins is a decent proxy to think through earnings power, and are expect international EBIT will be positive by then as well. We do see a few big step function potential costs that are worth framing, and want to discuss where our logic could be wrong. There has been a huge amount of incremental investment into the business with fulfillment having slowed in 1918 in terms of order of magnitude yy dollar growth pretty substantially we think there is a massive step up this year Content costs a straight up gross margin headwind have increased substantially and potentially could again We actually think a more logical owner of things like NFL rights at the next round of negotiations is more likely to be AMZN, AAPL or GOOG relative to the current rights holders as we suspect we have hit a negative inflection point with linear viewingcable subscribers. We also think that the potential for one of these tech companies, who each have MASSIVE international audiences to have a big impact on the leagues international presence and brand would likely only further drive this this would be a huge step up in content costs One day shipping evolves into same day shipping as we have been writing about since initiating on AMZN last year, we have viewed one day shipping as a step along the road on the way to inevitable same day shipping a clear incremental driver of incremental cost headwinds. The grocery category is clearly one of the last uncaptured categories of huge TAM particularly in the US. We think that the elements of fresh product, different fulfillment center needs in part because of perishable, are subscale at this point. But would highlight that 1 we think Bezos world view is that he wants AMZN to own as large a percent of the consumers wallet as possible if they dominate in grocery, they will have largely achieved that, 2 groceries are arguably to last category within which AMZN is not dominant, so see fewer negative new category introduction headwinds and 3 we are assuming AMZN can ultimately get to a 34 EBIT margin in grocery at scale. Logistics? we have been of the view for several years, that AMZN has ambitions to compete with FDXUPS in the top US citieswhere they have the most density. We think investors have been paying for some of these investments along the way, and think that AMZN has pulled back midCovid from their intentions to compete with the thirdparty carriers, but think this is a function of necessity given the incredible high level of demand for all eCommerce companies. We would be shocked if AMZN is not in market well in advance of 2024 pricing below their peers. Overall, we think this competitive push would be a headwind to EBIT, but would be favorably viewed as a new leg of the AMZN story. The ad business is more mature than we appreciate. We think that the ad biz grows correlated with GMV and while we have estimated GMV growth of 13 in 2024, and ad growth at 20, potentially we are overestimating the headroom in the business.","{""Cost Management"": ""negative"", ""Earnings Power"": ""positive"", ""International EBIT"": ""positive"", ""Investment"": ""neutral"", ""Content Costs"": ""negative"", ""Gross Margin"": ""negative"", ""Fulfillment"": ""neutral"", ""Logistics"": ""negative"", ""Competition"": ""negative"", ""Ad Business"": ""neutral"", ""Growth Strategy"": ""positive""}"
13,13,1,"In summary, we think that most of these potential large pockets of investment exfulfillment buildout would likely be seen as incremental drivers of revenue growth, so to the extent EBIT numbers are too high, we would suspect the revenue numbers are likely too low.

14,14,1,"WHERE WE COULD BE WRONG 1 AWS continues to slow faster than we expect, 2 3 party fees at 26.7 for 2018 we model their exit run rate for Q4 at 27.3 see material pressure. AMZN began reducing some fees over the last 2 months we are nervous that they could actually be way too high, but dont know how to handicap magnitude, 3 offline retail is able to strike back harder than we appreciate we are surprised WMT already had its wheels in motion in terms of a response 4 we are underestimating the size of the investment cycle.
