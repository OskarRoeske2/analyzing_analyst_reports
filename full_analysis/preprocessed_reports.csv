GM already hosted a special Cruise Colin M. Langan event and test drive in September therefore, we expect the investor day to focus on its EV strategy. We also expect the company to provide some broad 2023 guidance Tim Liu and possibly provide midterm margin guidance vs. 2030 target last year. The media has already reported that GM will announce EVs will be profitable by 2025. We remain skeptical that EVs can be sustainably profitable by 2025 even with IRA help, though Kosta Tasoulis pricing raw mat assumptions will be key. The timing of the event is pretty challenging, as GM will likely focus on long term, but investors are keenly focus on the near term. Moreover, we suspect near term color on 2023 might be more negative pension, mix, etc. We remain UW.', 'Current consensus adj EBIT for 2023 is 10.9B vs. 2022 guidance of 1315B and our 9B estimate. GM is expected to provide some color on 2023 drivers, but not full guidance. We expect most updates will be headwinds as consensus still looks too high in our view. We are optimistic that production will rise in 2023 with improved semi supply, and GM will also benefit from the recent decline in raw material costs, which implies part of the 5B in 2022 headwinds should reverse. That said, there are also numerous challenges into 2023 including likely price decline from record levels see Exhibit 2, normalization of vehicle mix see Exhibit 1, lower pension income est. 1B headwind, continued EV investment costs, FX, and the UAW contract negotiations.', 'Can GM deliver on EV profitability by 2025?', 'At the last Investor Day, GM promised ICE like EV margins by 2030. Since then, battery raw material costs have dramatically spiked therefore, it would be surprising if GM can still see EV profitability by 2025. While IRA is a meaningful help, we remain skeptical that EVs will be sustainably profitable by 2025. We estimate EV SUVs will be 2,850 lower profit than a comparable ICE vehicle. More concerning, we estimate EV pickups will be 12,375 lower profit than a comparable ICE pickup. Key factors to understand around EV profitability will be the pricing assumption vs. ICE, raw mat assumptions, and the inclusion of other costs advertising, marketing, RD, etc.', 'At the last investor day, GM guided to doubling sales expanding margins to 1214 910 precrisis by 2030. Given investors were disappointed by the lack of midterm guide posts, we expect GM to provide midterm guides this year. We suspect any 23 year margin targets would be consistent with 910 historic margin vs. longterm targets as it takes time for SaaS to scale.', 'Investment Thesis We rate GM as Underweight. GM is the largest US automaker by market share and actively invests in autonomous technology, electric vehicle development, and connected car capabilities. However, we believe that the rise in battery raw material costs has negatively impacted the outlook for BEV profitability, and consequently, GMs profitability. Moreover, US fuel economy regulations will likely force automakers to sell BEVs to meet targets. Overall, we see limited nearterm catalysts as the normalization of new vehicle pricing and higher input costs likely offset expected volume increases. In addition, we also see headwinds from the 2023 UAW contract negotiations.

Of course the path between now and 2020 is filled with unknown risks, but we mention the above to showcase the long term growth prospects for Google. The company is taking the cash flows from its performance marketing business the best in the world in our view and chasing after large markets such as content, operating systems, enterprise computing, robotics and automation. We are particularly keen on the potential for Googles robotic efforts under the leadership of Andy Rubin, the founder of the Android operating system. While Googles longer term investments tend to have a 10 year horizon, we may see the Robotic effort may monetize at an accelerated pace given the pace of acquisitions over 10 acquired companies targeted to the effort in our opinion. We also expect that the click pricing declines seen since 2011 should reverse in the relatively near future fall of 2015? as mobile monetization improves and location based marketing gains traction.

TSLA was reluctant to guide margins higher in the near term given expected launch ineciencies as Austin Berlin ramp and cost uncertainty. Consistent with the cost concerns, we expect auto margins to moderate in 2022 as BEV raw mat contracts roll o or reset. The stock is trading down slightly post market possibly reect cost concerns.', 'We are raising our 2021 EPS estimate from 5.30 to 6.10 to reect the Q3 beat 0.39 higher Q4 margins 0.41. We are raising our 2022E EPS from 5.70 to 6.25 given the stronger underlying margin performance. We also raise our 2023 EPS estimate from 5.35 to 5.75, our 2024E EPS from 5.35 to 5.60, our 2025E EPS from 6.80 to 7.00. We are raising our price target from 660 to 860 to reect a higher longterm op margin 14 vs. 12 prior in our DCF model. We maintain our Equal Weight rating.', 'Raw material headwinds likely delayed not canceled', 'TSLAs strong Q3 auto margin was impressive in the face of rising battery raw material costs see Exhibits 1 2. Key commodities like lithium, cobalt, and aluminum are up over 50 yy. TSLA indicated the raw material cost increases have already had a substantial impact on results however, the company has many longterm contracts that helped mitigate the full impact. As these longterm contracts expire, the pricing will likely rise. Signicant costcutting would be needed to oset these headwinds. The shift to iron phosphate based batteries would help manage this risk and likely helped in China in Q3 however, it will take time to shift to this chemistry globally.', 'TSLA puts positive spin in NHTSA investigation, but risks remain', 'When asked about the NHTSA investigation, TSLA said it was excited to partner with the regulatory body to help them understand a softwareoriented vehicle. However, the NHTSAs investigation into TSLA continues to expand, and NHTSA is reportedly nominating a senior advisor who has previously commented on the need for better regulatory oversight of new technology. We highlighted in our initiation that we see rising risk of regulation of Autopilot and FSD, particularly following the letter from the Chairman of the NTSB. This risk continues to rise.', 'TSLA remains one of the largest beneciaries of the proposed US EV tax credits. The credits were originally included in the US infrastructure bill however, they were removed when the size of the bill was reduced. Democrats subsequently reintroduced the EV credits as part of the broader budget plan. The new proposed credits would allow up to', '12,500 in credits to buy an EV depending on if the vehicle was made in the US and was made with a labor union.', 'The company also announced that it started to roll out its TSLA insurance product last week in Texas. This product will enable good drivers to qualify for lower cost insurance. The company is nding a strong correlation between its driver safety rating and accident risk.', 'Our 860 price target reects the output of our 3stage DCF analysis of the core auto business assuming an 11.5 WACC, 20 510 year growth, 15 1115 year growth, and a 10.25 terminal growth rate. We also include 28bn in value associated with solarstorage, insurance, and an option on the autonomous rideshare business.', 'Downside Risks New EV competition and regulatory risk associated with Autopilot remains a key risk for Tesla in our view. Commodity ination and increases in tension in China could also negatively impact the stock. Like all automakers, any costly product recalls could also impact TSLAs brand.', 'Upside Risks Any positive news around new capacity additions, the positive reviews of the FSD update, the addition of a US EV credit within the proposed stimulus bill, and a decline in commodity prices would benet the shares. In addition, the announcement of new market expansion like solar or storage in the past could be a positive catalyst.', 'TSLA We have an Equal Weight rating on TSLA. We see modest upside near term from deliveries and likely benets from added US EV credits. However, we see nearterm risks around rising raw material costs and possible increased US regulation on Autopilot. Midterm we are cautious TSLA will have sucient Model 3Y demand to meet the large amount of added capacity.']",860.0,equal,359.0133361816406,371.3333435058594,409.9700012207031,276.3666687011719,381.8166809082031,254.67999267578125,317.5400085449219,209.3866729736328,309.32000732421875,204.9900054931641,False,False,False,False
