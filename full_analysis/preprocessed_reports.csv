0,1,20201001_Pivotal_Research_Group_AMZN_AMZN-_We_Think_the_Street_Buy_and_Sell_side_are_Lo.pdf,2020-10-01,Pivotal Research Group,AMZN,Amazon.com Inc.,Consumer Discretionary,"['BOTTOM LINE We and almost every other investor we have spoken to over the years, has been framing the AMZN SOTP valuation wrong. Amazon advertising is only 5 of revenues, but is far greater contributor to overall nonAWS EBIT margins than the street recognizes. Said differently, If advertising was viewed as a standalong business unit we will explain why it shouldnt be, it would represent well north of 300 of 2020E nonAWS EBIT.', 'Based on our view that there is massive upside by 2024E, we increase our PT to a Street high of 4,500 based on an average of our 2024 SOTP and 30x our 2024 EBIT power of 91bn vs. our inprint estimates of 71.5bn and the street at 69bn both of these are modeled back at 10, Overall, we think Previous BUY investors are materially underestimating the earnings power of the business. We are going to be good bulls not all our colleagues always are and not factor all of the goodness in our estimates. We wanted to frame a highly likely outcome, as well as dynamics of the AMZN business that we this not totally Previous 3,925 appreciated. As a long time buysider, I think one of the most important values the sellside can bring is reframing an underappreciated dynamic. We dont think we are going to disappoint.', 'We would highlight that this is not a shortterm call. We do think Street estimates for fulfillment in particular are modeled too low in H121 based on the companys message that they are embarking on another fulfillment center investment cycle made loud and clear in our view on the 2Q20 call. Also, we all know eCommerce has seen a massive acceleration from the pandemic, but can imagine guiding could be challenging. Long term, we would bet that over a 4year period a Long AMZN Short the market position will be handsomely rewarded.', 'Everybody who is using a SOTP model for AMZN is doing so incorrectly ourselves too. We also are not huge fan of SOTP models because the Buyside or Sellside makes inaccurate conclusions, but in AMZNs case think is necessary. Why we are not a fan These SOTP analyses are often done as means to justify that a company is worth more than it is currently trading at, but let us be clear. Analysts may lie the market doesnt lie and the associated price a stock currently trades at is what it is. It can turn out to be true, taking the case of Icahns successful push to separate PYPL from EBAY. We would argue there are a lot more reasons that untethered from EBAY, PYPL has been able to transform into a different business than it would if still owned by EBAY. But back to our initial point, analysts may lie stocks dont lie. Massive kudos to whomever bet alongside Mr. Icahn, but this has been a grand slam home run, with PYPL alone at a 230bn mkt cap. We do not remotely subscribe to the thesis that AWS profits highly profitable and quantifiable are being used to subsidize retail losses.', 'SOTP debates aside, we would all concur that more disclosure is better than less disclosure. This typically leads to multiple expansion given investors greater understanding of the different moving pieces of complex businesses. Examples we would cite are BABA cloud and offline have been huge drags on a highly profitable core business, NFLX domestic is highly profitable vs international, and GOOG most recently took a cue from some of these other megacaps. Ironically, AMZN over the last few years has gone from the megacap disclosing the least to the one disclosing the most.', 'Now lets chitty chat AMZN. We think the street often tries to ascribe different multiples to AWS they certainly should, advertising, subscription, FBA, GMV, 1p revs, 3p revs etc. You name it, somebody has done it. The only reported FACTS we have about OI is AWS, Domestic and International so all the other assumptions are being made by the Street.', 'We have historically modeled for our SOTP 1 Domestic and 2 International GMV we gross up the 3 party GMV and admittedly are making an assumption on the take rate, as it likely has only continued to uptick given FBA growth, 3 AWS, 4 Advertising, and then have applied a holding company discount.', 'We believe you could nitpick our approach to international GMV. That said, we believe 1 The company remains in aggressive investment mode particularly in India and suspect this market alone is a large of the international losses', '2 Based on our channel work, we are of the view that most of the Western European markets are doing MSD OI margins 3 Unlike China, which was a guaranteed unwinnable fight for AMZN relative to Chinese natives like JD, and BABA, there was a zeroprobability chance the Chinese government would allow ecommerce to be dominated by a foreign player. 4 By comparison, we think the Indian government is way more foreign business friendly, and valuing the company on retail OI god knows how many assumptions you need to make to come up w a clean retail OI number would attribute no value to international revenues.', 'We would advocate the investors should essentially look at the business in two primary buckets AWS and Everything Else So why do we think so? AMZN is probably the company that penned the term Flywheel or certainly made it pervasive in the investment and operating communities. What do we mean? Lets start to dissect by reporting line. Retail The 1p and 3p businesses, while with different margin structures 3p is much higher and reported only as the net take, are intimately intertwined. They benefit from the same endcustomer base. With FBAs continued expansion and penetration as a of the 3P business, they often share the same warehouse space, as well as the same logisticsdelivery providers. They share the same payment processing and benefit from the same marketing. We have long put zero stock in trying to look at one vs. the other. FBA increasing as of the mix is good for retail margins and AMZNs take rate, but to our SOTP comment, we are not going to try and put a different multiple on one vs. the other. Subscription Prime Sweet Sweet AMZN Prime. While we get that investors love subscription businesses because they are sticky, recurring, and have much greater degrees of predictability, AMZN Prime is all about the flywheel. There may be a small base of Audible users or more on the come with its recent Luna Cloud gaming service announcement, but end of the day the subscription business at 19.2bn in 2019 is all about Prime. Back to our Flywheel comment, the Prime business exists because of the robust selection, and value proposition it represents to end consumers. And to further sweeten the deal, AMZN over the last 57 years has only further increased the value of a prime subscription by including an increasingly robust offering of streaming video, streaming audio and most recently, 1day shipping. On the other side of the network effect, the larger the Prime subscriber base, the more enfranchised sellers are in participating in AMZNs FBA Fulfillment by Amazon program. Having the Prime Enabled logo next to your item, is a key driver to a shoppers propensity to click. So back to our comments about Retail, Prime and Retail are intimately intertwined. Within that context, we think ascribing a value to Subscription in SOTP separately also makes no sense Advertising As we have framed in our earlier notes about AMZNs ad business, 1 We think they are the only online player really benefiting from trade budgets today, 2 We believe there was an evolution internally in which AMZN found the right advertising business for AMZN. We estimate at least 8590 of the AMZN business today is sponsored listings. In this scenario, an advertiser pays for higher placement within the product sort order, the user stays on AMZN, and AMZN keeps the transaction and transaction data. To use CPG as an example we think by far the largest advertiser vertical on AMZN, we think PG, Unilever, Energizer companies that dont have a real DTC strategy view advertising on AMZN to be not so different than paying for favorable shelf placement at WMT, TGT, KR, etc. The reality is, this is a where their customers are, b has better quantifiable results than the offline analog, so have been happy participants. We think that AMZN could become more aggressive with AMZN Firepotentially giving the TV device away to further drive their video inventory, but think that this hasnt happened yet but who knows prime day is around the bend, but a development worth closely watching. Similar to Retail and Prime, we think investors have potentially thought through the Ad business as being a separate business unit, but we think that it sits under the broader retail umbrella to a greater degree than investors recognize. The ad business doesnt exist without retail.', 'So why does this all matter? Lets do a little fun math. 1 FY 2015 North America margin was 4.3, international was 0.3 2 The FY 2015 Other revenue line in totality was 1.7bn with advertising likely 1.21.3bn, 3 Street estimated GAAP EBIT is 69bn for 2024 In our view, 2016 was the year advertising had the real break out with Other revenues growing 74 yy and advertising growing, we estimate, 90 yy. For context, our estimate of advertising was 13.8bn in 2019, growing 41 yy to 19.4bn in 2020. Now this is where it gets interesting based on our channel work, and some common sense, we estimate that advertising EBIT margins if it were a stand alone are north of 80, and believe that could even be CONSERVATIVE. Running this math based on 2019 actuals, NonAWS EBIT was 5.3bn, and', 'Advertising if looked in isolation would be 11bn implying that the rest of the business is losing money??!?!?!?!?! We actually think of this as a huge positive not a negative. As we stated under bullet 4, we think that there is AWS and Everything Else so we look at advertising as another part of the Flywheel. Valuation is often more of an artform than pure science, but end of the day what matters is what is the underlying earnings potential of the business. In our view, we think the key exercise for valuing AMZN, is to do is the following Take AWS Revenues and EBIT estimates for 2024 newly published today we are at 100bn in revenues and 34.5bn in OI Assume the standalone advertising business does 52bn and an estimated margin of 75 lets assume they do more around CTVFire TV so the margin goes down from predominantly sponsored products, that is 39bn! So combined, between these two lines, we are already at 73.5bn in EBIT If we assume that the nonad components of the north American retail biz are able to get back to a 4 EBIT margin as they were in 2015 North America was 4.3, we would get on our estimates of retail revenues of 19.5bn All in, this is 93bn of EBIT Earnings Power vs the street at 69bn 14 EBIT margins vs the street at 10 Assuming we are correct, by 2024 investors wont need to do these financial acrobatics, because the underlying report EBIT of the busines will show up flowing through the income statement.', 'Lets entertain the negative side and see where we could be wrong. Do you mean to say AMZN is back to its old days of selling things at a loss? And dont they always find a way to keep spending? Well yes and no. We think this comparison to 2015 margins is a decent proxy to think through earnings power, and are expect international EBIT will be positive by then as well. We do see a few big step function potential costs that are worth framing, and want to discuss where our logic could be wrong. There has been a huge amount of incremental investment into the business with fulfillment having slowed in 1918 in terms of order of magnitude yy dollar growth pretty substantially we think there is a massive step up this year Content costs a straight up gross margin headwind have increased substantially and potentially could again We actually think a more logical owner of things like NFL rights at the next round of negotiations is more likely to be AMZN, AAPL or GOOG relative to the current rights holders as we suspect we have hit a negative inflection point with linear viewingcable subscribers. We also think that the potential for one of these tech companies, who each have MASSIVE international audiences to have a big impact on the leagues international presence and brand would likely only further drive this this would be a huge step up in content costs One day shipping evolves into same day shipping as we have been writing about since initiating on AMZN last year, we have viewed one day shipping as a step along the road on the way to inevitable same day shipping a clear incremental driver of incremental cost headwinds. The grocery category is clearly one of the last uncaptured categories of huge TAM particularly in the US. We think that the elements of fresh product, different fulfillment center needs in part because of perishable, are subscale at this point. But would highlight that 1 we think Bezos world view is that he wants AMZN to own as large a percent of the consumers wallet as possible if they dominate in grocery, they will have largely achieved that, 2 groceries are arguably to last category within which AMZN is not dominant, so see fewer negative new category introduction headwinds and 3 we are assuming AMZN can ultimately get to a 34 EBIT margin in grocery at scale. Logistics? we have been of the view for several years, that AMZN has ambitions to compete with FDXUPS in the top US citieswhere they have the most density. We think investors have been paying for some of these investments along the way, and think that AMZN has pulled back midCovid from their intentions to compete with the thirdparty carriers, but think this is a function of necessity given the incredible high level of demand for all eCommerce companies. We would be shocked if AMZN is not in market well in advance of 2024 pricing below their peers. Overall, we think this competitive push would be a headwind to EBIT, but would be favorably viewed as a new leg of the AMZN story. The ad business is more mature than we appreciate. We think that the ad biz grows correlated with GMV and while we have estimated GMV growth of 13 in 2024, and ad growth at 20, potentially we are overestimating the headroom in the business.', 'In summary, we think that most of these potential large pockets of investment exfulfillment buildout would likely be seen as incremental drivers of revenue growth, so to the extent EBIT numbers are too high, we would suspect the revenue numbers are likely too low. AMZN longterm skeptics will respond to an analysis such as this that they always manage to spend away the upside, but if grocery is in fact the last frontier category, we think they will', 'WHERE WE COULD BE WRONG 1 AWS continues to slow faster than we expect, 2 3 party fees at 26.7 for 2018 we model their exit run rate for Q4 at 27.3 see material pressure. AMZN began reducing some fees over the last 2 months we are nervous that they could actually be way too high, but dont know how to handicap magnitude, 3 offline retail is able to strike back harder than we appreciate we are surprised WMT already had its wheels in motion in terms of a response 4 we are underestimating the size of the investment cycle. Incremental investment for oneday is impacting shipping costs if they really want to get this right, it could be a material investment in fulfillment too.', 'RISKS 1 Over saturation of AMZN within eCommerce, 2 macroeconomic deceleration causes greater than expected declines in commerce, 3 AWS slows materially, and 4 antitrust action.']",4500.0,buy,161.06300354003906,156.25,172.18150329589844,150.2239990234375,169.0,147.59750366210938,175.27200317382812,157.5970001220703,186.57049560546875,159.3874969482422,False,False,False,False

This framework holds that the modern analyst should measure prices in relation to gold for tangible assets and measure the market value of intangibles in relation to bitcoin to derive real prices and real estimates of economic activity and values.', 'Under our Bitcoin Gold Dow Theory analysis framework, there are three ways overvalued stock prices can return to fair value. 1 Share prices can fall 2 Share prices can remain the same while the companies increase their underlying value value and price converge in the future 3 The value of money falls this could result in an increase in nominal share prices but a decline in the real purchasing power of the shares.', 'Since the time of our previous report, the price of money as measure by gold and BTC has declined and Amazon has increased its underlying value.

We point this out given that our initial BTC target was surpassed in December 2017. Based on todays level of monetary insanity we have a BTC target of 20,568 and a gold price target of 6,652.

Main markets are the Americas 45, Europe 25, Greater China 15, Japan 8, and the rest of Asia Pacific 7.', 'Investment Merits 1. 5G to drive record iPhone sales. Apples flagship 5G iPhone 12 lineup launched in 2020 sold 100mn units two months earlier than the iPhone 11. Volumes were close to its iPhone 6 supercycle during the 4G transition in 2015. Customers see 5G as a key reason for upgrading their iPhones after years of holding back replacements. Apples new iPhone 13 lineup is expected to be launched in September 2021, featuring up to 20 more efficiency and larger batteries to complement the powerhungry 5G phone. In anticipation of strong demand, Apple has ordered more than 100mn A15 chips from TSMC for the launch, 25 more than the 75mn chips for its 2020 iPhones. We expect the iPhone supercycle to continue, with FY21e and FY22e sales potentially topping 2015s record of 231mn units sold. This would be powered by upgrades from an estimated 48 of the iPhone users still using iPhone X and older. iPhone sales are Apples main cash cow, at 50 of sales in FY20.', '2. Margins to remain elevated. Strong growth in Apples services is expected to lift gross margins, together with higher ASPs of 5G devices in the product segment. Service margins of 66 are more than double product margins. Service revenue has also been expanding at a faster CAGR of 17 vs flat growth for iPhone. Growth is spearheaded by Apples evergrowing installed base, which topped 1.65bn in January 2021. Apple expects service growth to moderate after a bumper 3Q21 when YoY growth was 33 from the COVID19 rebound to more sustainable double digits. Apples 5G products also allow it to raise weighted ASPs by more than 20 from a year ago, boosting product margins. We expect gross margins to track above 40 in FY21e and FY22e, higher than their 5year historical average of 38.', '3. Gaining market share through supplychain dominance. As competitors grapple with chip shortages, Apples share of global smartphone sales breached 5year highs, hitting 21 in 4Q21. In the highend market, Samsung was hit by its Texas semiconductor fabrication plants monthlong power shutdown and Vietnam factory suspensions due to COVID19. Samsungs new Galaxy Notes launch in 2H21 may be delayed as a result. Apple managed to mitigate shortages in 3QFY21, with the revenue impact coming in lower than its US34bn guidance. Apple holds buying power over suppliers through scale purchases and upfront cash payments, leaving competitors handling price shocks and shortages created by Apple deals.', 'We initiate coverage with a BUY rating.

Antitrust laws could affect service revenue. Apple could lower its App Store fees for larger developers as a result of lawsuits. Apple last year lowered its fee to 15 for smaller developers making less than US1mn per year from their apps.

We have adjusted a few of our underlying assumptions to better reflect the likely more challenging operating environment during 4Qi.e., increased pricing actions but more than offset by worsened supply chain pressures as well as updated FX outlook, which results in our totalorganic sales moving to 8.98.4, from 9.28.6 previously. Even after reducing this outlook, we are still ahead of the current Consensus Metrix and implied company guided 4Q organic growth of 7.6 and 7.1, respectively. From a bottomline perspective, our 4Q21 EPS of 1.53 remains unchanged and is ahead of current Bloomberg consensus of 1.52and, for what its worth the implied 4Q company guidance of 1.47 that is likely the bare minimum. We expect that underlying consumer demand remained strong at the end of the year and that the additional pricing actions in the fall began to flow though in the 4Q21 although more so in 1Q22 and help to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures. While some of the operational issues experienced in 3Q should have resolvedlessened e.g., FLNA plant disruption, Gatorade shortage, we would not be surprised to see other pain points in 4Q including potential for employee absenteeism impacting productionsupply and publicized snacks issue in UK relating to SAP upgrade. Netnet, our estimates imply a 6.6 twoyear organic sales CAGR, just in line with 3Q. Looking ahead to 2022, we think PEP got a good amount of credit for providing muchneeded visibility earlier in 3Q21 by committing to its longterm financial algorithm MSD top line and HSD EPS despite the significant inflationary pressures. As such,weare not expecting much of a surprise when the company provides official initial guidance now with 4Q earnings under its belt, although expected dilution from juice brands divestiture announced in August 2021 could lead to core EPS modestly below HSD growth were modeling for 5.2 organic topline and 6.1 EPS growth, or 7.7 predilution. As has been the norm from staples earnings so far, in particular HPC, the operating environment has arguably gotten incrementally challenging from a supply chain perspective near term, which is the main reason we are now more conservative, although we think PEP has enough levers to mitigate e.g., RGM, productivity. Netnet we expect continued solid performance from PEP, and its resilient and defensive business model is clearly in favor as evidenced by its outperformanceof late since 3Q results PEP 16.1 vs. XLP 11.1 and SPX 3.1, and while current valuation is making it tougher to see more meaningful upside in shares near term, we think PEP remains a core staples holding given its resilience of aboveaverage underlying topand bottomline growth and better visibility, which are the primary investment merits that investors look for in staples..', 'Framing TopLine Expectations for 2022. Following a very strong year from a top line organic growth perspective in 2021 expectation to close the year at approximately 8 on top of 4.3 organic growth in 2020 despite pandemic impact, the company is expecting 2022 to be consistent with its longterm financial algorithm, which calls for MSD 46 organic growth. While the company moved past the worst of the pandemic impacts in 2021, the year was not without challenges, and with still recovering marketsand various supply chain issues through the year, we see continued runway for recovery and underlying growth in 2022 across segments excluding juice divestiture impact in PBNA given pricing actions and volume growth with improving supply conditions, recovering awayfromhome volumes, and resilient athome performance. At a high level, we think the underlying momentum driven by investments in marketing and innovation position the company well to deliver in line with its MSD organic growth targets, particularly given momentum in FLNA and PBNA which we discuss more in the note. All in, we are currently forecasting organic revenue growth of 5.2 volumesup 1.6 and pricemix up 3.6, which is very slightly ahead of Consensus Metrix consensus of 5.1.', 'What Will Margins Look Like in 2022? PEPs ability to potentially drive margin expansion in 2022 despite the significant inflationary pressures being seen throughout the industry should set it apart from the majority of CPG peers and highlight the resilience and attractiveness of its business model, which calls for core operating margin expansion of 2030 bps per annum. PEP has solid visibility into expected cost pressures and has taken multiple rounds to price through higher inflation, including some over the summer and much more in the fall, with the full impact being seen in 1Q22. The company should also continue to execute against 1 billion annual productivity initiatives, which is mostly reliant on leveraging automation and digitization and should be particularly helpful in an environment with higher labor inflation. The divestiture of lowermargin juice business we estimate the business generated HSD EBIT margins will be a benefit to margins, which we estimate could be worth about 2030 bps to gross and EBIT margins. While the input cost environment continues to evolve, given the pricing and productivity efforts across the business, we think PEP can deliver about 20 bps gross margins expansion in 2022 roughly flat predivestiture and operating margin expansion of 65bps33 bps pre divestiture.', 'Updated FX Outlook. With its 3Q21 earnings release, PEP reiterated its outlook for FX to be a 1 translational tailwind to both revenue and EPS, and since the day prior to that release October 4, 2021 FX has turned less favorable by about 60 bps for 4Q according to our currency model, and looking ahead to 2022, the impact of currency has gotten incrementally unfavorable by about 50 bps. Netnet for 2022, we would expect currency to be a headwind of about 1. For 4Q21 and 2022 we are now forecasting FX to be a 30 bps benefit and 100 bps headwind, respectively, vs.60 bps benefit and flat previously.', '4Q21 Expectations. Our 4Q21 EPS of1.53is unchanged vs. Bloomberg consensus of 1.52 and companyguided implied 4Q EPS of at least 1.47 even as we tweak a number of our underlying assumptions to better reflect our view of the operating environment in 4Q and the scanner data, as well as updated FX outlook. As such, our 4Q organic growth estimate moves to 8.4 from 8.6 previously, but is still ahead of current Consensus Metrix of 7.6 and companyguided implies 4Qorganic growth of 7.1. We are expecting an acceleration of pricemix in the quarter as additional pricing actions begin to flow through our 5.3 pricemix is ahead of consensus', '5.0 and implies a modest sequential acceleration in the twoyear CAGR while our 3.0 volume growth is 20 bps ahead of consensus and implies roughly flat sequential twoyear CAGR. From a margin perspective, we expect gross margin compression of 75 bps to 52.7 vs. consensus 52.5 and 5 bps of leverage on SGA to 40.7 vs. consensus 40.6 as incremental pricing actions and productivity partially offset inflationary and supply chain pressures while increased AM is offset by reduced COVID19 costs.

While these steps do show promise, but at this point in time, the impact on total revenue is negligible compared to the revenue from the iPhone.', 'iPhone had a phenomenal year in FY2015, which saw accelerated upgrade rate leading to close to 40 yoy sales growth. Unit sales have increased at an impressive CAGR of 17 yoy over the past 4 years.', 'However, with the poor showing in its latest quarter results, coupled with near term macro headwinds and market saturation, it is likely that iPhone sales for the remaining of 2016 could be flattish, and this year could be the first year that AAPL will report a decline in unit sales.', 'That said, AAPL mentioned several mitigating factors that could underpin iPhone Sales Upgrades. The first half of the upgrade cycle for iPhone 6s has seen a slightly higher rate than the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago. It cited a Kantar survey showing a 95 iPhone loyalty rate. Furthermore, according to Kantar, the iPhone 6 and 6 plus accounted only for 24 of all iPhones being used in US and China US and China iPhone users account for 65 of its total user base. Coupled with iPhones 6s sales, that represents a sizable portion of current iPhone users that have yet to upgrade to the 6 or 6s, which AAPL could tap on when the next iteration is introduced. This was also mentioned previously by Tim Cook, with 60 of current iPhone users have yet to upgrade.', 'Switchers. AAPL mentioned that there were more switchers from Android or other platforms to iOS in the 1HFY16 compared to any other sixmonth period ever.', 'First timer. AAPL mentioned that India could be the next growth driver and market for iPhones, citing iPhone sales in India were up 56 yoy. While global smartphone market seems to have reached saturation point in developed nations, Indias LTE network is still rolling out, representing a large untapped market. First timers are crucial to the Companys long term growth. Each new user is a potential loyal AAPL user. Once the user becomes entrenched into its Ecosystem, the user could start engaging in its Services and purchasing other AAPL products.', 'iPhone SE, released on 31 March was not included in 2QFY16s results. AAPL cites that demand for iPhone SE has exceeded its expected supply, leading also to the depressed 3QFY16 profit guidance. Should sales for the iPhone SE take off, it would be indicative of pent up demand for cheaper iPhones and an opportunity for AAPL to create further headway into developing markets.', 'Should AAPL follow its previous release schedules and release the iPhone 7 around September end FY16, it could also entice the large pool of older iPhone users to upgrade as the iPhone 5 and 5s would be 2 product cycles old by then. However, the new iPhone 7 could only start contributing to its bottom line in FY17.', 'Given these factors, we believe that while iPhones will face headwinds in the increasingly saturated developed nations smartphone market, the fears of peak iPhone are', 'overblown and believe that there is potential for iPhone sales to grow in the future, albeit at a slower rate.', 'AAPLs tablet offering the iPad, used to account for about 18 of AAPLs total revenue. However, the rapid growth of iPhones and falling iPad sales has led to iPad now making up only 10 of AAPLs total revenue.', 'Tablets have longer replacement cycles compared to smartphones as consumers are less compelled to upgrade their tablets compared to smartphones. In 2QFY16, AAPL reported iPad sales were down 19 yoy with unit sales of 10.25 mn. iPad sales were slightly better than consensus estimates which were on average about 9.95 mn. Of note however, the new 9.7 inch iPad Pro was only released at the end of Q2 2016 and sales figures would not have captured the full extent of demand. AAPL expects the next quarter to be the best iPad quarter in two years based on their estimates. For now, we expect the iPad to continue accounting for a smaller component of AAPLs revenue over time.', 'Macs are AAPLs laptops offering, they account for 11 of AAPLs revenue. Mac unit sales have been on the uptrend over the past 3 years as the Macbook has gained popularity and more mainstream acceptance. However, Macbook sales fell 9 yoy in 2QFY16, which was worse than consensus estimates. However, a silver lining is that AAPL is gaining traction in China, where 80 of the Chinese Mac buyers were purchasing for the first time. Management has given guidance that it expects Mac sales to increase in 3QFY16 on the back of an updated Macbook, which was thinner and lighter with better specs. As one of AAPL core offerings, we expect Mac sales to maintain its share of revenue as it gains traction as a viable alternative to PCs. We believe that Mac sales will increase as compared to the iPad, despite both having similarly long replacement cycles compared to iPhone due to Mac having greater functionality.', 'Apple Watch led to a 30 yoy growth in Other Product revenue, since it is a relatively new product offering, the Watch has generated new avenues of revenue for AAPL. Whether the take up rate can continue or the Watch becoming like the iPad in terms of replacement rate remains to be seen.', 'Revenue from Services rose 20 yoy to US6 bn in 2QFY16. Apple as a service is a concept that AAPL has taken large steps towards and is increasingly becoming the bright spot in the current environment of stalling hardware sales. Services create the Eco system which allows AAPL to further entrench its user base, creating more reasons for its stickability. AAPL has been showing that it is increasingly able to monetize that active user base to generate more revenue from its services. In the 1QFY16, AAPL revealed that it had 1 bn active installed base, devices that were actively engaged in Services within that quarter, leading to Installed Base Related Purchases of US8.9 bn. This figure grew by 27 yoy to US9.9 bn in the March quarter.', 'App Store. Revenue grew by 35 yoy, generating 90 more global revenue than Google Play.', 'Apple Music. Music grew from 10 mn to 13 mn paying subscribers since introducing a download and streaming model, leading AAPL to be optimistic that Apple Music revenue will start growing again moving forward.', 'Apple Pay. Being very new, Apple Pay is not expected to make significant contribution to AAPLs FY16 revenue. However, adoption rate is increasing exponentially, with transactions volume growing by 500 yoy. AAPL has launched over 2.5 mn locations that accept Apple Pay, with plans to expand further. While usage rates remain low, as the idea of NFC Near Field Communication payment is still new and not widely adopted yet, there is still much room for growth and eventually monetization. However, with credit card companies like Visa, as well as other phone companies like Samsung, are also heading into the space, the idea of NFC payments might not take that long to be legitimized. As such, we view this as an avenue with great potential in the future.', 'Overall, we see great potential in Apple as a service. It remains the one category of revenue that AAPL has been able to achieve consecutive doubledigit growth, on average about 20, over the past 5 years. Services provide recurring revenue stream for AAPL that could grow independent of the unit sales, making it especially helpful in the current environment of slowing hardware sales. We expect Services revenue to continue to grow and become a greater part of AAPLs revenue as upgrade cycles for iPhones stretch to 23 years.', 'Of note though, is Chinas recent ban of AAPL iBooks and iTunes Movies, which could be a potentially worrying trend. Considering that if Services are to be the future of AAPL and Chinas important role in this strategy, then it would be a huge detriment to AAPLs future growth if the ban expands to the rest of AAPLs services. For now however, with just the iBooks and iTunes Movies ban, while worrying, it is not a large dent in AAPLs services growth and the thesis of Service growth should still hold.', 'AAPL main revenue source by region comes from Americas, which makes up 40 of the total revenue. While Americas contribution to AAPLs revenue has been increasing on an absolute value, it has not been growing at a very fast pace. Americas revenue grew 4 in 2014 when total revenue grew 7, and grew at 17 yoy in 2015 when total revenue grew at 28. It is likely that Americas revenue will continue to grow at a slower pace as compared to the total revenue.', 'On the other hand, Greater China, which currently makes up 25 of its total revenue, has been rising at an incredibly fast pace. In 2014, Greater China only made up 17.4, this represents an 84 yoy increase. In the 2QFY16, China had a qoq change of 32 from 1QFY16, and a yoy change of 26. China was the main reason for AAPLs explosive growth in the previous year, growing by 84 yoy in FY15. In comparison, 2QFY16s results appears dismal, coming in at US12.5 bn vs previous years US16.8 bn. When seen against the backdrop of such a breakout year previously, it is not surprising that investors have reacted negatively to AAPLs performance this quarter in China. However, we feel that this is less of a slowdown and more of a normalization of AAPLs sales in China. AAPLs YTD revenue from China stands at roughly US30.8 bn, already almost as much as FY14, where revenue from China was US31.8 bn. As LTE network continues to expand in China and adoption increases, we expect Chinas demand for iPhones to continue to grow. However, whether China adopts the same replacement rate that Americas has had over the past years remains to be seen. Regardless, China should continue to be a growing source of revenue for AAPL.', 'As mentioned earlier, India is also a developing market which could provide avenues of future growth for AAPL, sales having grown 56 yoy. As LTE networks continue to rollout, smartphones become more useable as compared to 2.5G or 3G networks, leading to increase demand. APAC ex Japan accounted only for US15 bn, being home to more developing nations, but as those nations continue to develop, AAPL should be able to take advantage of improvements in infrastructure to expand there.', 'AAPL has amassed a large amount of cash, with US232.9 bn in cash and marketable securities as of 31 Mar 2016, up almost US20 bn yoy. However, 90 of this cash hoard is outside the USA. This is significant due to USA tax laws, which would cause AAPL to have to pay upwards of about US60 bn if it was to remit back to the USA. AAPL has thus taken advantage of the current low interest rate environment to take on more debt. AAPL issued another US15.5 bn in USD notes in the latest quarter, bringing its debt level to about US72 bn. This puts its current net cash position at about US160 bn, which is equivalent to about US30 per share. Most of the borrowings has been put to fund the Capital return program, mainly dividends and share buybacks.', '5. Attractive Capital Return Program Dividends and buyback increased . AAPL announced a further increase to its capital return program on 26 April 2016, increasing it to US250 bn from US200 bn in April 2015. The dividend was increased to US0.57 per share for shareholders on close of business 9 May 16, up c.10 from US0.52. Since AAPL started paying a dividend in 2012, it has increased the dividend each year consecutively, from US0.38 per share to US0.52, with a CAGR of about 8p.a. This represents a payout ratio of about 24, which is relatively low, indicating that there is still substantial room for future dividend growth. Share repurchase authorization was also increased from US140 bn to US175 bn.', 'Valuation Methodology Discounted Free Cash Flow Model DCF model was used to derive a valuation of AAPLs intrinsic value.', 'We have made the following assumptions for the model Headwinds in iPhone sales leading to decline and slow growth over the next two years, after which iPhone sales should start growing at a slower rate iPad sales may pick up in the next FY but repeat the cycle of slow replacement, leading to flat revenue Increase in Mac take up as Macbooks gain traction and more mainstream acceptance as PC and laptop replacements Service Revenue will increase as AAPL expands their ecosystem and continues to increase the monetization of their user base', 'We initiate coverage for AAPL with a Buy rating with a target price of US119.37 , derived from our DCF estimates.', 'Poor response to iPhone 7. While AAPLs customer base is very loyal, if iPhone 7 has a lacklustre showing and fails to excite that base, it could lead to even lower take up and a longer replacement cycle. Weaker consumer sentiment amidst slowdown in the global economy could also negatively impact the take up of iPhones.', 'Slowdown in Services. Services have been growing at an incredible rate and been the one bright spot in the 2QFY16. AAPL transitioning into more of a Services company rather than a Hardware company also forms the basis for our estimates of future growth. If Services revenue slows down or if consumers fail to become entrenched into AAPLs ecosystem, it would adversely affect AAPL and our valuations.', 'It is difficult to find a one to one comparison to AAPL in the US market, as while its peers do have some overlap with AAPL, there is also large differences between them. As such, we have chosen to show Google and Microsoft as peer comparisons. Google is relevant for the Android comparison and Microsoft is relevant for the Windows phone, PC and its recent move into a Service company as well.', 'AAPL remains the largest of the three companies by market cap. Based on PER, it is also the more undervalued stock amongst the three, trading at about 10x PER while the other two trade at more than 30x PER.', 'AAPL, at US92.79, is also trading near its 52 week low of US91.85. Based on the Historical PER chart below, it is also trading at near 8 year low valuations. At US92.79, AAPL is trading at 10.32x PER as compared to its 5year historical average of 13.7x PER.', 'AAPL gave poor guidance for 3QFY16, citing continued macro headwinds sending AAPL shares tumbling down. We expect AAPLs share price to remain depressed in the short term, while the market reacts bearishly to AAPL prospects and fears on iPhones saturation.', 'However, AAPLs balance sheet remains strong with net cash at almost US160 bn, which works out to almost US30 net cash per share. At current prices, that indicates a net price US60 per share, indicating a c.7x FY16e PER.', 'Additionally, its brand equity and loyal consumer base allows AAPL to continue to generate large profits and cash flow even in difficult seasons. Its growing Services revenue is promising as it shows AAPL is making headway in their transition to a Services company.', 'Therefore, we believe that the current knee jerk reaction in the market to AAPL is overblown, leading to AAPL being undervalued. As such, we initiate a Buy rating on AAPL with a Target Price of US119.37 , indicating about a 28 upside to the share excluding dividends.']",,none,21.402904510498047,21.194419860839844,25.063861846923828,20.697263717651367,27.23832130432129,23.75549697875977,30.791845321655273,24.47480583190918,35.807559967041016,30.722087860107425,False,False,False,False

The company reported iPhone unit sales of 39.3 million, growth of 21.8 on a revenue basis and 16.2 on a unit basis. We mention the unit growth remains materially below the IDC industry growth rate of 25.3. Given that Apple is generating the majority of its revenue and profits from sales of the iPhone, we mention a few statistics taken from IDC data', '1 The total growth of the mobile phone market feature and smart phones was 4.8 in 2013 1.82 billion units.', '2 Smartphones have passed over 50 of mobile phone shipments, representing 55.1 of total in 2013.', '3 The smartphone market itself is slowing, from 46.6 in 2012, to 38.5 in 2013, the to 25 rate in the June quarter of 2014.', '4 Android took 84.7 market share in the June quarter, with iOS at 11.7 and we do not expect the iPhone 6 to materially change this dynamic.', '5 Apple was able to increase its ASP to 605 in the September quarter. This compares to 58.6 of the Android shipments in the June quarter costing less than 200 off contract. Apple commands a price more than double the average selling price of the broader market.', 'We mention these points to highlight that Apples current dependence on iPhone hardware sales may be a looming headwind. The market dynamics for smartphone growth is slowing and may converge to the 5 growth rates of the overall mobile phone market. For us to turn more positive on Apple shares we prefer to see a stronger recurring revenue stream with a monthly component coming from streaming music and movie, payments and advertising. We understand the company is positioning for these markets, and it remains to be seen if Apple can build up a robust service layer before the smartphone product cycle elongates.', 'Apple reported September quarter revenue of 42.1B. Revenue grew 12.4 YoY. Revenue for the FY 2014 was 182 B 7 YoY International sales accounted for 61.4 of total revenue in the September quarter and 64.3 for the full year. Apple returned over 19B to its shareholders in the September quarter.', 'iPhone The company sold 39.2M 12 YoY units in the September quarter. Macintosh Apple sold 5.5M 25 YoY Macs during the quarter. iPad Unit sales and revenue declined for the third consecutive quarter. iPad revenue was the 5 worst level of the 18 quarters the product has been in existence, with the only quarters being lower the initial four quarters at launch. There are now over 50 models of the Company Data iPad compared to just a handful at launch. Unit sales of 12.3 million were the lowest in 10 quarters, and a warning signal to what the future could hold for the smartphone market. Company guidance for the fiscal 2015 first quarter is 63.566.5B in revenue, gross margin of 37.538.5, tax rate to be 26.5, and operating expense of 5.45.5B.

We expect iPhone unit sales to drop to 42.5 million in the March quarter, reflecting typical seasonal declines and implying a 19 decline from the prior year. This is clearly an important metric and one that Apple said they would no longer report when they issued guidance 63 days ago. It is not helpful to investors to not report this metric.', 'Subsidies? CEO Tim Cook primarily cited a weakening economy in China as the reason for the revenue shortfall and the environment sounds very bad there and obviously not being helped by the ongoing trade war or the rising prices of Apples products. Cook also noted the lack of subsidies by wireless operators in developed markets. That is not a new trend. On CNBC, Cook suggested that tradeins offered by Apple can act as an effective subsidy, but operators have been offering tradein promotions for years, albeit at lower levels in the past two years. Link There has not been evidence of an incremental acceleration in the decline in upgrade rates in the United States or other developed markets. The replacement cycle might not be rebounding, but its very hard to believe that a further lengthening in the product cycle is a material contributor to the miss reported this afternoon.', '0.0 revenue growth is our new expectation for Fiscal 2019, but we believe Apple can return to revenue growth in the June quarter.

We see that it is more likely that the market for smartphones decelerates than accelerates. 3 September quarter guidance likely includes the benefit of building up channel inventory, which was decreased in the June quarter by 4 million units. 4 Channel inventory build may negatively impact December quarter results. 5 iPhone revenue declined for the second consecutive quarter, and we estimate that iPhone revenue to decline for the next 5 quarters on a year over year basis. 6 Average selling price for the iPhone dropped 10 YoY and 7 sequentially, driven by customer interest in lower priced iPhone SE, resulting in the lowest gross margins in 7 quarters. 7 Operating margin of 23.9 was the lowest in 7 years. 8 Greater China revenue declined 33 YoY and 29 sequentially, and even with adjustments for currency, we note the market declined in a quarter where the low cost iPhone SE was released. 9 Only two areas of the company produced revenue growth, iPad and Services. Services revenue, while touted by management, is only 14 of total. iPad revenue grew although units sold declined driven by higher ASPs. 10 Domestic cash is down to 7 of total, at 17 billion, a 29 sequential decline, limiting flexibility as the company returned 13 billion in the quarter, with a dividend commitment of 3.2 billion per quarter.

However, when we ask ourselves Do we see Apple gaining or losing its next 100 billion of Company Data value, the answer remains losing. The reason we picked 100 billion is to accommodate a rally such as today, and we still see that the dynamics of the next iPhone cycle is positioned to disappoint the market.

A return of mobility could dent the at home strength PEP has seen both in Food and Beverage albeit thats more conceptual at this point, and PEP has invested heavily into sustaining brand momentum into 2022. Nevertheless, a year of 7 pricing on top of a year with 5 pricing with historically dicult volume comps creates a bit of a balancing act momentum yes, but tough comps too so its hard to say if the volume call is conservative.

For COGS, this would imply commodities in Q123421 were a negative 1.72.85.27.1 impact, i.e. an exit rate of over 7, and our sense is this is building into 2022 with a HSD potential impact to COGS just from commodities.

Revenue from iPhone unit sales grew at an even slower pace at 10 YoY, as customers opted for older models at lower prices. Average selling price declined 35 sequentially and 76 from the December quarter. ASPs of 561 are still materially above the expected industry average of 314 in 2014 according to IDC. While Apple is currently enjoying success selling its old model phones into emerging markets, one has to question the long term viability as competition becomes more aggressive in the mid and entry markets, offering consumers current model phones at similar or lower price points, and with a willingness to capture less gross margin. The mix shift to the older model Apple phones resulted in gross margins of 39.4, above the company guidance of 3738, and 250 basis points above the prior year June quarter. We expect the favorable gross margin trends to reverse starting in the current quarter as the next generation iPhone should have a lower margin profile particularly if the phone has a sapphire screen.', 'iPad. The company saw its second consecutive quarter of decline in iPad units sold on a YoY basis. Unit sales at 13.3 million were approximately half of the December quarter unit sales. While investors have largely glossed over the decline in iPad revenue, we mention it is a distinct possibility that Apple may experience declines in iPhone unit sales after the next upgrade cycle, if consumers lengthen the life span for smartphones as core features such as LTE, fingerprint scanning, and larger screens have the potential to satiate the typical customer. Our estimates for the coming upgrade cycle include some larger numbers such as 59.5 million phones in the December quarter, a number that may be hard to eclipse in the December 2015 quarterly results.', 'Channel inventory. We estimate that iPhone channel inventory was kept near record levels at 15.25 million units, a small decline of 150k units from the March quarter. We also mention that while the company disclosed the change in channel inventory, it stopped providing the absolute number. For comparison, the company reduced channel inventory by 600K units in the prior year June quarter to 11 million units. The growth of channel inventory at 39 YoY meaningfully outpaces the unit sales volume of 10 YoY. Using 13 weeks in the quarter, and based on the 35.203 million units sold in the quarter a pace of 2.7 million units per week, we note that 15.25 million units in the channel represents approximately 5.5 weeks on inventory.

With a market capitalization of 282 billion, our take is that the AWS business is priced in to stock. It is possible that risks to the margin of the AWS business may appear over time if services become commoditized. We see that the question of generating leverage from the core retail business is partially driven by controlling delivery costs, with net shipping costs estimated at 4.1 of net sales, and total shipping losses to exceed 1 billion for the second consecutive quarter.

Looking at Apples share performance chart over the last two years, we mention that the other time that Apple has traded above the 100 mark was in September 2012. This raises the question, is the company poised to break out to new life time highs, or could shares be negatively impacted by overheated expectations and a slowing market for iPads?', 'While we remain concerned on the iPhones shrinking market share, which was just 11.7 worldwide in the June quarter according to IDC Android was 84.7, we are positive on the burgeoning service layer that the company is growing. This includes Apple Pay, iBeacons, and improvements to iAds in iOS8 that allows for retargeting consumers. While we still see iAd as a faltering business, the potential when connected with iBeacons and Apple Pay is impressive. We would like to see the company build a robust subscription streaming music Beats and video offering to complement its other products.', 'iPhone We expect the company reverses the rather steep recent decline in average selling price given the product refresh and the addition of the premium priced iPhone 6 to the product mix. We estimate 38.5M units sold at an ASP of 600 representing 56.7 of revenue. Unit volumes are growth of 13.9 YoY and 9.4 sequentially. While the iPhone is an impressive revenue and profit driver for the company, unit volume growth remains materially below the broader market which posted growth of 25.3 in the June quarter according to IDC. Our HOLD rating is driven in part by concern that the upgrade cycle for premium smartphones may elongate as the current iPhone provides the core needs for most users fast connection speeds, biometric identification, larger screens. Faster and thinner may prove to be a less compelling reason to upgrade going forward. In our view, we are already seeing an elongation in the iPad refresh cycle. We expect the upgrade cycle for phones could also be stretched out by carrier reluctance to continue to subsidize handsets. We are currently modeling 59.5 million iPhones in the December quarter with an ASP of 655. This represents unit growth of 17 above the prior record for the company. Apple remains particularly vulnerable to posting record smashing results but having the outcome viewed as a disappointment due to overheated expectations.', 'iWatch. We are adding in the Watch to our FY2015 estimates, with 18 million units at an ASP of 500. Given the watch is not available for sale, we expect this estimate could have a wide variance.', 'Our estimate of revenue for September quarter at 40.8B is growth of 8.8 YoY and 8.9 sequentially.

While it is too early to tell whether ecommerce penetration will permanently ratchet higher, strong digital demand appears likely to persist over at least the near to midterm. While digital demand appears to have ramped aggressively, we also note omnichannel retailers have rapidly launched or expanded local fulfillment capabilities leveraging store footprints, and have so far seen an enthusiastic consumer response e.g., TGTs sameday services 278 YoY in its F1Q20. What does this mean for our mostly pureplay ecom coverage? Our view is somewhat mixed, but positive on balance we view accelerating growth and persistence of digital demand as strong positives that likely outweigh enhanced fulfillment capabilities among omnichannel players.', 'AMZN Raise Estimates, Raise PT to 3,000. While we note ramping local fulfillment capabilities and exceptionally strong e commerce data pts from omnichannel retail competitors, we nonetheless expect that AMZN is likely to benefit from exceptionally strong ecommerce demand in 2Q, likely extending into 2H20. Though we view omnichannel retailers recent progress on BOPIScurbside as very much worth monitoring, we believe that AMZNs continued buildout of lastmile fulfillment capacity and a gradual return to more hectic work and school schedules among consumers will likely shift momentum back toward rapid delivery AMZNs 1day Prime and Prime Now from competitors storebased fulfillment options. Based on our increased forecasts and improving comparative valuations, we have raised our price target to 3,000 23x 2021E EVEBITDA from 2,725 prior and maintain our Overweight rating on AMZN shares.', 'Estimate Changes. We have raised our ecommerce paid unit growth forecasts for the remainder of 2020 and 2021, and have also modeled higher 3P unit mix vs. our prior forecasts.

Unit growth and 3P mix are also revised upward for 2H and, modestly, for 2021.

News sources indicate that the super app may be launched as a joint venture that would leverage Tatas e commerce business and Flipkart. Note that WMT made another 1.2 billion investment in Flipkart in July, roughly two years after purchasing an almost 80 stake in 2018 for 16 billion. Its clear that some initial operational and regulatory challenges have not deterred the companys interest in this massive market. We view the news as mixed for now. While a path to value creation in Flipkart looks to be evolving positively given the potential for a future IPO, and we applaud managements willingness to think outside the box TikTok is another example here, doubling down on this complicated market is not without risk. Further assessment is difficult without more details. We continue to rate WMT Equal Weight.', 'Price Target 130 from NC Our 130 price target reflects 25x our NTM earnings estimate. We see numerous upside and downside risks to our Equal Weight ratingtarget. 1. Continued progress in digital could earn greater credibility with investors and a higher valuation. 2. International divestitures would be positive for returns and the stock. 3. Traffic and comps could slow as instore initiatives mature, putting pressure on the stock. 4. Margins could fall by more than expected if digital losses grow, competition intensifies, and costs rise.', 'WMT has made strong progress in its repositioning against high initial skepticism, and the pace of change should be applauded. The company has essentially turned itself into Amazons biggest online retail competitor while returning its stores to positive traffic growth. We have been impressed with the effort, but simply cannot get behind the stock after its recent run given that structural issues still loom large. E commerce risk is shifting to foodconsumables, hard discount poses a threat, traditional competitors are beginning to fight harder, and the cost of doing business in retail continues to rise. We also find it difficult to ignore the fact that WMT still operates 700 million sq. ft. of selling space 3x its closest peer at a time when retail is under siege, and is the countrys largest grocery store during the most challenging period in the industrys history. As we assess the companys progress against our concerns and the stocks improved valuation, the riskreward appears balanced at current levels.', 'Walmart, Inc. is the worlds largest retailer, operating stores in various formats around the world and providing a broad assortment of merchandise and services at every day low prices EDLP.

Periodend securities rose by 24b this qtr and mgmt signaled additional purchases were possible. However, a material increase in the securities book still seems unlikely with rates at current levels as JPM views the long term return as being too low.', 'That said, JPM has a ton of dry powder to add securities over time if rates rise andor they change their view on rates. On todays call, we asked how much this could be if rates rise to a level that mgmt felt comfortable would generate a good long term return. JPM noted it could easily deploy 200b of cash into securities.', 'This 200b compares to nearly 600b of excess deposit growth since 4Q19 ie before COVID and related central bank actions. We define excess deposit growth as the change in deposits of 840b vs. a combined 244b increase in loans securities. Recall that mgmt has previously acknowledged that some of the deposit growth over this period is noncoreless sticky as system liquidity is reduced over timerates rise.', '200b of liquidity deployment can add nearly 20 to EPS with rates at 3', 'Deutsche Bank does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports. Thus, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of this report. Investors should consider this report as only a single factor in making their investment decision. DISCLOSURES AND ANALYST CERTIFICATIONS ARE LOCATED IN APPENDIX 1. MCI P 051042021.', 'It all depends on the level of rates and whether JPM would deploy the full 200b. But assuming they would, we can run some earnings sensitivities shown below.', 'If 10 year Treasuries hit 2 and JPM were to deploy the full 200b into 30 year agency backed RMBS pass throughs what big banks typically buy, this would boost net income by 11.', 'Each 100bp rise in base rates would increase this 5... RMBS spreads remain around current levels of 50bps and JPM deploys the full 200b. These are a lot of ifs, but this helps illustrate the potential earnings upside from deploying excess liquidity. As noted in the prior section, the earnings leverage outlined just above from deploying excess liquidity is in addition to the rate leverage disclosed in JPMs 10Q. Recall that as of 630, a 100bp rise in rates would boost JPMs 2022 net income by 15.', 'Other tidbits from the call Mgmt noted expenses would increase in 2022 vs. 2021, even though capital markets related revenue and related comp would likely be lower. This is higher than the flattish costs assumed in consensus for 2022 prior to today, but also not a huge surprise given expense pressure at JPM and across the banking industry. On the call, JPM noted the likely higher costs in 2022 reflected continued inflationary pressures and investment spend. We previously assumed flat costs and now assume a 12 rise.', 'Mgmt acknowledged that FY22 net II guidance implied a 300mplus increase in 4Q21 vs. 3Q. However, JPM cautioned not to run rate the implied 13.5b given seasonal boosts from marketstrading and one time benefits from PPP. Looking out to 1Q, theres also day count adjustments to make. This caused some market concern that consensus FY22 net II expectations of 55.1b may be too high. However, wed point out that mgmt was also upbeat about card growth in 2022 and as discussed above has already started to deploy some liquidity into securities.', 'Accounting for all this, our 1Q22 net II estimate is 13.1b and our FY22 estimate is 55.8b.', 'Card fees In the Consumer Bank, card fees were 651m in 3Q vs. 1.2b in 2Q. Mgmt noted on the call that the sequential decline was primarily due to higher marketingacquisition costs and due to a 180m adjustment to rewards liabilities. The adjustment is considered a one time event while marketing costs are expected to continue and be slightly higher in 4Q.', 'On loan growth, mgmt noted it has seen some recovery across lending products including the following For card, mgmt noted faster spend down of excess deposits for customers who are generally inclined to revolve and believe card outstandings should grow in 2022.', 'In home lending, mgmt expects portfolio additions to outpace prepayments in 4Q similar to 3Q trends.', 'For CI, mgmt noted that utilization rates had a little bit of an uptick among smaller corporates.', 'In CRE, mgmt noted robust origination pipelines and have removed any pandemicrelated pullbacks in credit and expect to see a little bit of net loan growth going forward.', 'Mgmt also noted expected loan growth in markets but noted its', 'FICC trading In the earnings materials, it was noted that the current qtr included an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio. Mgmt noted that while FICC declined 20 yoy on a reported basis, ex the adjustment, FICC declined 15.

It was a strong quarter overall. The biggest drivers of the EPS beat were a large loan loss reserve release and lower than expected chargeoffs and a tax credit.

We have adjusted our margins assumptions and our 4Q21 EPS estimate of 0.41 moves up a penny and is inline with the current Bloomberg consensus. We think KO is set up for a strong quarter as ourconsensus estimates contemplate only a modest acceleration from 3Q in the twoyear CAGR on unit case volume and pricemix despite all indications that the operating environment was likely supportive sequentially e.g., October started strong, 3Q Delta variant impact, full benefit of offcycle price increase, positive US scanner data trends. From a margin perspective, we are more conservative vs. consensus on gross margin as six fewer days in the quarter and convergence of shipmentsunit cases drives deleverage in addition to headwind from incorporation of BODYARMOR closed 111, finished product all co manufactured and faster finished good sales, although our SGA estimates are modestly below the Street. Looking ahead to 2022, management tone around the underlying momentum has been positive were confident that were going to come out of COVID with a model that can drive the revenue at the topend of the model and our expectation for another abovealgorithm year in 2023 modeling 7.0 doesnt feel aggressive as it implies a 3year unit case volume and pricemix CAGR of just 1.1 and 2.4 vs. preCOVID 2year CAGR 2.1 and 3.3, respectively, despite the accelerated pricingRGM and marketinginnovation efforts bearing fruit. Management may choose to stick with its longterm algorithm when it initially guides 2022 given the COVID19 variants, but we think investors appreciate the strong brand equity ability to take pricing and favorable setup and would welcome a raise through the year as visibility increases, which should further help the stock narrative, although FX headwinds could limit USD EPS flow through. Despite KOs recent rally shares 9.5 vs. XLP 3.6 since December 13 see ournote, valuation is still at a 1x PE discount toOWratedPEP, which we expect to narrow we actually like both stocks and believe they are not mutually exclusive. Our Dec22 target price moves up 1 to 64 based on 24x our 2023 EPS inline with 2year average.', 'Framing TopLine Expectations for 2022. Management has sounded confident on the underlying topline momentum given recent organizational changes, investments behind innovation, and marketing optimization and as noted above management believes it can drive the topend of 46 organic revenue algorithm. We are anticipating another abovealgorithm year in 2022 given stillrecovering volumes from COVIDimpacted 2021 1H21 volumes remained below 2019 levels and continuation of strongerthanhistorical pricemix given pricingRGM focus to offset cost pressures. Allin, we are currently modeling 7.0 organic revenue growth with unit case volumes 3.0 and pricemix 4.0, although we think there could be further upside tension with further normalization of the operating environment.', 'Margin Expectations for 2022. Despite its more assetlite model, KO still faces impacts from the inflationary costsupply chain environment and FX, and with its 3Q earnings guided to a midsingledigits headwind to COGS for 2022 i.e., higher than midsingle digits inflation for commodities as the company rolls into higher cost hedges in 2022. We think its possible that the cost environment has gotten incrementally more challenging for at least some of KOs cost exposures, particularly for juice, which is The CocaCola Companys largest direct commodity exposure orange juice concentrate prices have surged 30 since KOs 3Q21 earnings call. Price increases and accelerating RGM initiatives should help to offset some of the inflationary impacts, although we see other headwinds including acquisition of BODYARMOR and faster growth of finished goods carries lower gross margin. From a GA perspective, we expect the company to be able to drive some leverage overall as the company further optimizes marketing spending. Netnet, we are modeling for gross margin compression of 39 bps in 2022 and operating margin contraction of 6 bps', 'Updated FX Outlook . During the companys 3Q21 earnings call on October 27, 2021, management reiterates its fullyear 2021 currency outlook including a 12 benefit to the topline and 23 benefit to EPS and introduced expectations for 4Q21 including flat impact from FX on the topline and a 2 tailwind to EPS. The company also provided an initial 2022 currency outlook of a 2 to 3 headwind to both the top line and EPS. Since the 3Q21 earnings call, the USD has further strengthened according to our currency model by an average of about 80 bps between 4Q213Q22. For 4Q21, given hedging in place for G10 currencies we think its likely that KO could remain close to its approximately even impact guidance on the topline, and while we would assume that the currency impact implied by our model would fall within KOs initial 2022 guidance at this point to the topline, we do think it could be toward the lowerend, and could be below the lowend on EPS given historical multiplier of 1.2 1.5x currency impact from topline to bottomline. For the quarter, we forecasting a 0.5 impact to the topline inline with consensus and for 2022 we are forecasting an FX headwind of 2.7 vs. consensus 2.2.', '4Q21 Expectations. We are expecting another quarter of doubledigits organic revenue growth on unit case basis as we expect a modest acceleration in the twoyear volume and pricemix CAGR given further recovery in awayfromhome performance through the quarter vs. 3Q and also higher pricemix given additional pricing actions and further progress on RGM initiatives. We are forecasting 4Q21 organic revenue growth of 12.8 unit case volume 6.2, pricemix 6.6 versus the applesto apples Consensus Metrix forecast of 13.0 unit case volumes 6.4 and pricemix 6.6. Using concentrate shipments consensus is currently modeling for 3.9 organic growth shipments 2.7, pricemix 6.6 and on an applestoapples basis our model also calls for organic growth of 3.9 shipments 2.6, pricemix 6.6. On gross margins, we are below the Street as we see tailwinds from pricing and away fromhome recovery being offset by the fewer shipping days in 4Q six fewer, which drives deleverage, and headwind to gross margins from full acquisition of BODYAMOR, which closed on November 1 finished product model typically carries lower margins. We are forecasting 4Q21 EPS of 0.41, which is inline with the current Bloomberg consensus estimate and up a penny from our prior estimate.', 'KOprovided some broad strokes around its initial outlook for 2022 with its 3Q earnings on October 27th, most directly around the costcurrency environment anticipating MSD COGS inflation and 2 to 3 toplineEPS impact from FX and more indirectly around the topline, as we recall below. That said, a lot has obviously changed since then, and we provide our view on where KO will likely land on its initial 2022 guidance below.', 'Management has sounded confident on the underlying topline momentumgiven recent organizational changes emerging stronger, investments behind innovation, and marketing optimization doing more with the sameand CEO Quincey noted at a recent conference that were confident that were going to come out of COVID with a model that can drive the revenue at the topend of the model, which calls for organic revenue of 46.

However trends improved sequentially in September and momentum heading into 4Q sounded solid with management describing October results started strong and inline with expectations so we feel comfortable modeling for some modest improvement in the twoyear CAGR. From an organic growth perspective, the calendar 4Q has six fewer shipping days relative to the prior year which had two extra days, which will impact the concentrate shipment volumes and result in a convergence of concentrate shipments to unit case volumes year to3Q21 concentrate shipments 13 vs. unit case volume 8, which had been running ahead due to five extra calendar days in 1Q21 and inventory build by bottlers to mitigate anticipates supply chain pressures.', 'From a pricemix perspective, underlying our expectations for a slight acceleration in the twoyear trend is further pricing actions, which should be felt more fully in 4Q e.g., off cycle price increase of HSD in US put through in August, as well as further benefits from RGM initiatives to offset supply chain inflationary pressures incidence pricing from bottlers that are feeling pressures more.

Since the 3Q21 earnings call, the USD has further strengthened according to our currency model by an average of about 80 bps between 4Q213Q22. For 4Q21, given hedging in place for G10 currencies we think its likely that KO could remain close to its approximately even impact guidance on the topline, and while we would assume that the currency impact implied by our model would fall within KOs initial 2022 guidance at this pointto the topline, we do think it could be toward the lowerend, and could be below the lowend on EPS given historical multiplier of 1.21.5x currency impact from topline to bottom line. For the quarter, we are now forecasting a 0.5 impact to the topline vs. prior flat, inline with the current Consensus Metrix consensus of 0.5.

The exchange offer expired on Friday. An aggregate principal amount of 288.7m at maturity of the old notes, representing 82.5 of the old Notes, were validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn. Ciena Our View In the prospectus filed on Friday 728, the company mentioned that it has not made a determination that it will use the treasury stock method to account for these modified converts. However, we note that if the company decides to use the Treasury method it will help reduce dilution from the converts and boost estimated EPS looking forward by around 6 for the consensus on our calcs.

Shares have traded anywhere from 6 to 14 on earnings, with the stock trading up 4 of the last eight quarters.', 'We mention that if we take our 2017 revenue estimate of 158 billion, and generously apply a 10 margin, followed by a 25 tax rate also generous, and divide by the 487 million shares we estimate, this is 24.33 in EPS. Using a stock price of 735share, that EPS gives a 30x multiple for a company that is growing revenue 16 YoY . The point of this exercise is to show that even if the company was able to obtain a 10 overall margin profile, one could view that the valuation is already reflected at current share price levels.', 'Regarding AWS, our estimates are revenue of 2.7B with margin of 28, revenue growth of 50 YoY and 9 of total revenue. We see risks to growth slowing and profitability being reduced via a combination of competition, price cuts and overall service commoditization. If one were to assign the value of Walmart to Amazons retail operations, approximately 228B, that would leave 119B in value for Amazons remaining businesses, which are primarily AWS. While we respect the growth and margin profile of AWS, it is subject to commoditization risk and a valuation of over 100 billion at its current level seems more than reasonable. CEO Jeff Bezos is reported to have used the line Your profit is my opportunity, and we mention that AWS competition may seek to flip this around on Mr. Bezos by using price as a lever to win business.', 'We estimate revenue for the June quarter to be 29.2B, which is growth of 26 YoY and 0.2 sequentially. This compares to the consensus estimate of 29.6B. Our earnings per share estimate of 1.05 compares to 0.19 in the prior year and 1.07 in the prior quarter. Consensus is 1.11.', 'North America We expect revenue from the North America segment to be at 17.0B in the quarter for 58 of total, 24 YoY growth and segment operating income of 869M. We expect Media to grow in North America at 24 YoY for 19 of North American revenue and EGM electronics and other general merchandise revenue to grow at 23 YoY, accounting for 80 of North American revenue.', 'International We expect revenue from International segment to be 9.4B in the quarter with a growth of 24 YoY.
