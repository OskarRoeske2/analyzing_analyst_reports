    "        - Assign identified arguments to existing categories as much as possible.\n",
    "        - If the argument could fit into a broader category instead of creating a new one, prefer the broader category (e.g., 'Ad Revenue'/'Mobile Revenue' should map to 'Revenue').\n",
    "        - Create a new category ONLY if no broader category is existing\n",
    "        - A new Category MUST be generic and short (MAXIMUM 2 words) and distinct from existing ones.\n",
    "    3. Sentiment Classification:\n",
    "    - Label each argument’s sentiment as 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral' depending on the context it is used (financial perspective).\n",
    "    4. Output:\n",
    "    - Return a JSON (Structure: {{'Category 1': 'negative', 'Category 2': 'positive'}}).\n",

      "        Text: Last night, ahead of the 2014 CES, NVDA hosted a press conference where CEO Jen-Hsen Huang took the cover off of several next-generation Consumer Semiconductors products and platforms. The press conference, thematically centered around Games, Chips and Cars, left little doubt about the direction the company is heading, and while we find the technology compelling, we think the companys focus on penetrating the baseband and application processor markets will prove to be more difficult than imagined. We will be attending CES this week, and will provide more details after our meeting, but we opt to remain on the sidelines at this juncture.\n",

      "        Text: GameStream works hand in hand with the PC gaming device and NVDAs Shield, allowing gamers to stream PC-based games through Shield to their TVs supporting up to 1080p, 60Hz in real time while capturing and sharing the game play footage in real time. This demo was streamed through a server based in France, processed through the GRID server, with only 60 milliseconds of latency the human eye cannot recognize latency below 200 milliseconds. NVDAs second unveiling was its G-SYNC solution, which syncs the frame refresh rates between the monitor and the GPU, virtually eliminating stutter and lag in game play. For G- SYNC, NVDA has partnered with leading gaming monitor OEMs such as ASUS, Philips, 192-Core - Tegra K1 - super-chip based on Kepler: ViewSonic, Acer, BenQ and others, and will be available in 2Q14. NVDA sought to bridge the gap between PC and mobile gaming, spending several years developing an integrated app processor based on Kepler architecture and Tesla to deliver a PC-like experience on a mobile device. The Tegra K1, expected to be released 1H14, is a big jump forward in mobile graphics processing power, and is 1.5 times more power-efficient Stock Price Performance than QCOMs N/R S800 and Apples A7 processor. The new processor also allows game developers to develop titles that run across any device thanks to its Kepler Project Mercury - Bringing Tegra K1 performance to the road: architecture roots. Recognizing the shift to advanced automobile functionality, NVDA unveiled the Tegra K1 VCM visual computing module, which allows OEMs to design more advanced technologies such as pedestrian detection, blind-spot monitoring, land departure warning, collision avoidance, traffic-sign recognition and adaptive cruise control into their vehicles. Additionally the VCM leverages the visual computing power of the K1, allowing OEMs to completely customize the instrument cluster of the vehicle, and allowing customers to customize and visualize a vehicle like never before. NVDA is currently Market Data in 4.5MM vehicles worldwide, and is currently engaged with 20 OEMs in over 100 Compelling Technologies, But Saturated Competitive Markets: specific models. NVDA has spent heavily on its mobile application processor and baseband over the last several qtrs, creating a disconnect between OPEX and top-line growth. While NVDAs GPUs and level of integration are without equal, in our view its late entrance to the baseband market, which has become increasingly competitive at the mid to low end of the market, will likely present topline growth issues. We expect NVDA will seek to align itself with the top-tier OEMs in both smartphone and tablets however, given that AAPL dominates the tablet, and pricing pressure is fierce at Samsung and other Asian OEMs, we believe attach rates are likely to be muted.\n",

      "        Text: Holiday November-December comp of 5% easily beat Street consensus of 3%. The same store sales were impressive on a number of levels: 1 for the first time in recent history, the United Kingdom stores preformed better than the domestic locations, registering a 5.2% comp watches and a deeper emphasis on bridal were key 2 domestic same store sales of 4.9% were solid, as both Jared and Kay registered a 5.6% increase regional brands remain a drag, driven by key branded products, colored diamonds and charms 3 online sales, up 27.2% reflect an even deeper emphasis on the channel by management and increasing acceptance of the online channel as a purchasing resource for jewelry we note the company is able to leverage its omnichannel status by offering online customers the ability to buy items online and pick them up in the stores, allowing for the best of both worlds and 4 the outlet channel was among the key stars, outperforming the overall comp and validating managements confidence in the Ultra acquisition outlets are on track to be accretive in FY15 and offer a material unit expansion opportunity. All that glitters is not gold in the margin arena. While the comps were impressive, updated EPS guidance for 4Q was not, as management reduced overall EPS guidance to $2.12 to $2.16, from the previous level of $2.30 to $2.40. Key negatives on the margin side include: 1 more aggressive on the promotional side while the company did not run higher sales, they offered store management the ability to cut prices to drive deals in store, resulting in a 50 bp shortfall to gross margins 2 overestimating its ability to take advantage of lower gold prices, another 50 bp gross margin shortfall management did mention that in FY15 the company will take advantage of lower gold prices in all quarters, and 3 an anticipated slowdown in comps in January, as the bitter cold has hurt initial sales in the month management estimated that the cold weather has so far hurt 4Q revenue by $15-$18 million. The company is very pleased with the fashion level of offerings and its advertising campaign for the key jewelry Holiday for the first quarter. We note that, unlike most specialty retailers, Q1 is a material quarter for Signet on both the top and bottom lines, representing the second-largest quarter on both the top and bottom line. Reducing our FY14 EPS to $4.51 from $4.75 and FY15 EPS to $5.10 from $5.35, reflecting the 4Q guidance and a slightly more cautious stance on margins going forward even though we could argue that much of the 4Q margin miss was somewhat self contained, we believe it is best, at least in the uncertain near term, for us to be more cautious in our assumptions we also note that management stated that inventories are a bit heavy entering FY15 while not as big an issue as for our apparel players, it is another reason to be less aggressive, in our view. We believe, while the bottom line was below expectations, that Signets performance will be one of the strongest at the mall in what was a dreary Holiday season. Further, we view the company as poised to take further market share and drive upside as we go through FY15 and the positive at the UK stores, the outlets and online become an even bigger piece of the overall pie. As such, we would use todays weakness as a buying opportunity.\n",

      "        Text: We are reiterating our Hold rating and estimates for Urban Outfitters after the company reported a Holiday comp of 3%, which came in 170 bp below Street expectations, primarily driven by the Urban Outfitters concept. The poor and negative comp performance in the Urban division provides evidence that its not immune to the fierce price competition within the teen space and while we believe the introduction of incremental clearance sales likely aided in maintaining a desired inventory position, merchandise margins will suffer. In addition, although we applaud management for reviving the Anthro segment, we believe that there are clearly still issues within Urban that are yet to be corrected. We continue to wait for a more appealing risk/reward entry point and reiterate our Hold rating.\n",

      "        Text: Holiday comp of 3% was below the Streets expectation of 4.7%. By concept, Urban Outfitters comp was down 6% vs. 10% LY, Anthropologies comp was 11% vs. 5% LY and Free Peoples comp was 21% vs. 33% LY. While we view results in the contemporary concepts as a key positive, weak performance at Urban Outfitters, which represents 48% of the total business, was significantly affected by a highly promotional teen retail environment and continued weak fashion choices, especially within the womens division. Assumptions include: 1 a 1% comp 2 10 bp gross margin decline YoY and 3 140 SG&A deleverage YoY. With the continuation of brutally cold and messy weather in January and much tougher comparisons than the November/December period, we believe the January performance will drag down the overall quarterly comp. We do not see any reason to become more aggressive in our estimates, with severe industry pressures affecting the entire retail landscape and more specifically, the teen space. Bottom line: While we are at a point where we are more positive on URBN than we have been in the past, due to the improvements made to Anthropologie, we prefer to wait on the sidelines until comparisons ease, pricing pressure mitigates in the teen space, and results provide evidence that issues in the Urban Outfitters concept have been addressed and corrected. We reiterate our Hold rating as we seek a more compelling entry point into URBN.\n",

On the bottom line, EPS fell short of the $0.53 we previously modeled, and the $0.54 the Street had been looking for, due largely to higher than expected OpEx and a slightly higher tax rate 26% vs 25%. Gross margin of 62% was down 40bps Q/Q, but slightly better than our estimate and Quarter Product Mix: the midpoint of managements guidance. As mentioned, INTCs product mix during the quarter was quite a bit different than our prior expectations. We believe the strong demand for desktop PCs was likely related to upgrade purchases ahead of MSFT discontinuation of support for Windows XP OS on March 31st. With this upgrade activity likely to conclude in 1Q14, we believe desktop PC demand could hit an air pocket beyond 1Q14. Conversely, Data Center Group sales came in $225MM below our prior estimate, despite strong demand from Cloud up 31% Q/Q, Storage up 24% Q/Q and Networking up 24% as INTC seems to have overestimated the rate of recovery In-line Guide: in enterprise spending. INTC guided 1Q14 to be in the range of $12.8bn /- $500MM, Stock Price Performance which brackets our prior estimate of $12.6bn and the Streets $12.77bn estimate. Sequentially, revenue is expected to be down 7%, in line with typical seasonality. Gross margin is expected to be down roughly 300bps Q/Q, driven by higher platform Not Filling Fab 42: write-offs ahead of Broadwell, and lower overall platform volumes. INTCs decision not to equip Fab 42 may seem like a good decision on the surface as demand for PCs is not quite what it was three years ago when INTC began construction. Yet, we believe that longer term it may slow the ramp of the foundry business as Intel may now have less overall capacity to support high-volume customers such as AAPL.\n",

      "        Text: Haiku: We like the business, but the guidance is likely, to disappoint some. eBay meaningfully underperformed the market in 2013 producing a total return of 7.6% compared to a total return of the S&P500 index dividends reinvested of 32.4%. The company produced revenue and earnings that have skewed towards the lower end of its full year guidance driven by a range of factors such as macro spend trends and currency fluctuations. While its easy to be frustrated at the share performance in 2013, the counterbalance is that eBay continues to position itself as a critical partner to retailers as omnichannel commerce gains momentum. The collection of assets that eBay is building and buying, including its mobile leadership, one hour delivery, and the ability to assist with local store inventory by routing orders effectively, positions the company as a vastly different entity that its beanie-baby-bidding roots. The fact that the company does not compete with retailers remains an important platform differentiator. That said, when the company reports results after the market close on Wednesday January 22, we expect revenue and earnings to be in the guidance range no upside surprises and that the 2014 initial guidance may disappoint certain investors. Based on the fact that the company skewed to the low end of its 2013 guidance, it is reasonable that management may offer a conservative outlook for 2014. Given the increase in short interest to over 20 million shares, a doubling from the level a year ago, it appears that others are also expecting a tempered initial 2014 outlook from the company. Based on our expectations for a lack of near-term catalysts for the stock, we contemplated lowering our rating on the shares, but decided that the positive aspects of the business, including the omnichannel potential, the growth in active users, and the free cash ability, outweigh any near-term stock price fluctuations. We see that eBays core businesses remain healthy and well positioned. Our estimate of $4.5B in revenue represents 14.4% YoY growth and 17.3% sequential growth and is in line with consensus revenue of $4.5B. Our earnings estimate is $0.81 EPS, which compares to $0.70 in prior year and $0.64 in prior quarter. Our estimates compare to current company issued December quarter guidance of revenue expected between $4.5B to $4.6B and EPS of $0.79 to $0.81. Metrics - Marketplace: We estimate total gross merchandise volume GMV ex-auto of 21.7B, with fixed price format accounting for 71% of transactions for Q413. Total GMV ex-auto growth estimate is 14% YoY. We estimate US GMV ex-auto of 8.8B 40.5% of total GMV ex-auto. Marketplace revenue is estimated at 2.3B and 51.5% of total, representing 14.7% YoY growth and 16% sequential growth. Payments revenue is estimated at 1.8B and 41% of total, representing 21.5% YoY growth and 15.6% sequential growth for Q413. Total payment volume is estimated at 45.1B, growth of 3% sequentially and 8.9% YoY with 851M net number of payments. Metrics eBay Enterprise: We estimate eBay Enterprise revenue to be $342.5M and 7.5% of total, representing 14% YoY decline and 44% sequential growth for Q413. Company Data Other Metrics: We expect 51.5% $2.3B of revenue is international in Q413 while net revenue estimate for US is $2.2B 48.5% of total. We expect 126M 12.3% YoY, 2% QoQ global active users in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013 and active registered accounts of 140M 14.4% YoY, 2.2% QoQ. Mobile: 2.4M new users were added to Ebays mobile purchase in the September quarter. We maintain our FY13 and FY14 estimates, our BUY rating and our price target of $59 on shares of eBay Inc. eBAY trades at 19.7x our FY13 estimate with $10.2B in cash $7.82 / share, $4.1B long-term debt and $1.3B in cash from operations as of September 30, 2013. 1\n",

      "        Text: Marketplaces core GMV growth was 12% YoY, flat sequentially and down from 16% in 4Q12. We believe the slower growth was a result of lower levels of ecommerce spending in the U.S. and internationally. We note that holiday ecommerce spending was weaker than expected in the U.S. The company highlighted that Europe was below expectations, particularly volumes in Germany, its 2 largest market. Mobile continues to be a key Marketplace growth driver. eBay added 4.5 million new accounts in 4Q13, which we estimate over 40% were activated through mobile devices. However, new mobile accounts are still not translating into revenue in the same fashion as online accounts are, as evidenced by the solid 14% YoY increase in accounts, but flat 11% YoY growth in sold items. Segment margin of 41.1% was largely in line with our estimates of 41.5%. Looking through to 2015, the company expects eBays revenue growth to slow from the previous guidance of 14%, but segment margin to remain in line at 38-42%.\n",

      "        Text: Haiku: Enterprise demand, and a record quarter make, a fitting farewell. Microsoft reported upside December quarter results that showed its continued success in the Enterprise, and improved momentum in its device business. The quarter was a fitting farewell for outgoing CEO, whose successor is likely to be in place before the next earnings date in April in our opinion. While critiques of the outgoing CEO are well documented, and the company was late to participate in several key computing trends, our view is that the positives generated from Steve Ballmers tenure as CEO are broadly overlooked. It will be interesting to see if the strong quarterly results, and traction with devices and search, may serve as a mandate for a stay the course CEO, perhaps resulting in an internal candidate getting the nod. Microsoft reported record revenue of $24.5B for its fiscal second quarter that ended December 31, 2013. Revenue grew 14.3% YoY and 32.3% sequentially and was above our estimate of $23.3B. EPS of $0.78 3.4% YoY was above our estimate of $0.71 and consensus of $0.68. The standout metrics for us were cash flow from operations of $4.4B, operating income of $8B, and cash of $4.3B was returned to shareholders in the December quarter. Devices and Consumer: Revenue for this segment was $11.9B 13.3% YoY. - Windows OEM revenue decline of 3%. - Surface revenue of $893M, more than doubled revenue and units sold sequentially. Revenue for this segment was $12.6B 9.9% YoY. - Server product revenue growth of 12%. PC shipments Worldwide declined for the seventh straight quarter, by 5.6% YoY in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013, with 82.2M PCs shipped in Q413 compared to 87M in Q412. MSFT has $84B in cash $10.00 / share and $20.6B long-term debt as of December 31, 2013. $75.7B of the cash is offshore as of December 31, 2013. Microsoft generated cash flow of $4.4B from operations in the December quarter. We adjust our FY14 and FY15 estimates, maintain a HOLD rating and our price target of $35 on shares of Microsoft Inc.\n",
