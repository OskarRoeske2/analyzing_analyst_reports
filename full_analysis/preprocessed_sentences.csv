35,3,1,1,Apple Inc. Snapshot Apple Inc. AAPL recently released its 2QFY16 results on 26 Apr16.
36,3,1,2,"Results were not well received, with AAPL share price taking a tumble by more than 6 on the next market day."
37,3,1,3,iPhone units sales were slightly above consensus expectations but revenue and EPS came in below consensus estimates.
38,3,1,4,This marked the first time iPhone sales have fallen.
39,3,1,5,"Poor results along with poor profit guidance for the quarter ahead, which is far below consensus estimates, led to the drop in share price."
40,3,1,6,AAPL has experienced a 10.5 decline in share price over a 1 year period.
41,3,2,1,Fall in revenue and earnings.
42,3,2,2,"AAPL reported quarter revenue of US50.6 bn, missing consensus estimate by US1.37 bn and EPS of US1.90, missing by US0.10."
43,3,2,3,Gross margin was 39.4 vs 40.8 yoy.
44,3,3,1,Services were the saving grace.
45,3,3,2,"AAPL reported US6 bn in revenue for Services, an increase of 20 yoy."
46,3,3,3,"It cited growth in its App store, where revenue grew 35 yoy and Apple Music increased its paying subscriber base from 11 mn to 13 mn over the year."
47,3,3,4,Apple Pay also increased its transactions volume by 5x.
48,3,4,1,Other Products revenue increased.
49,3,4,2,Apple Watch sales helped to pull up the Other Products category by 30 yoy.
50,3,5,1,Hardware sales continue weakening.
51,3,5,2,"iPhone unit sales were down 16 yoy, iPad and Mac unit sales were also down by 19 and 12 yoy, respectively."
52,3,6,1,"Initiating coverage with Buy rating AAPL has had impressive 840 growth rate over the past 10 years, with iPhone as its main growth driver."
53,3,6,2,"Despite recent weakness, AAPL is still generating enormous profits and cash."
54,3,6,3,AAPL generated more than US50 bn in revenue and more than US10 bn in net income during a difficult quarter.
55,3,6,4,"Additionally, its expansion in Services segment could provide support to its future growth."
56,3,6,5,"Services has been increasing at an incredible rate, averaging about 20 growth over 5 years, and as AAPL expands its services, users would become more entrenched into its ecosystem."
57,3,7,1,"We are Positive on the Companys long term prospects, supported by its robust established user base and strong balance sheet."
58,3,7,2,"Nonetheless, much would still hinges on the Companys ability to innovate and contribution from its new products."
59,3,8,1,We have a DCF valuation of US119.37 for AAPL .
60,3,9,1,iPhone sales are the main revenue source for AAPL and accounts for 65 of AAPLs total revenue.
61,3,9,2,"As such, AAPL is known primarily as a hardware company, selling iPhones."
62,3,9,3,The Company has taken steps to diversify its revenue streams.
63,3,9,4,"While these steps do show promise, but at this point in time, the impact on total revenue is negligible compared to the revenue from the iPhone."
64,3,10,1,"iPhone had a phenomenal year in FY2015, which saw accelerated upgrade rate leading to close to 40 yoy sales growth."
65,3,10,2,Unit sales have increased at an impressive CAGR of 17 yoy over the past 4 years.
66,3,11,1,"However, with the poor showing in its latest quarter results, coupled with near term macro headwinds and market saturation, it is likely that iPhone sales for the remaining of 2016 could be flattish, and this year could be the first year that AAPL will report a decline in unit sales."
67,3,12,1,"That said, AAPL mentioned several mitigating factors that could underpin iPhone Sales Upgrades."
68,3,12,2,The first half of the upgrade cycle for iPhone 6s has seen a slightly higher rate than the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago.
69,3,12,3,It cited a Kantar survey showing a 95 iPhone loyalty rate.
70,3,12,4,"Furthermore, according to Kantar, the iPhone 6 and 6 plus accounted only for 24 of all iPhones being used in US and China US and China iPhone users account for 65 of its total user base."
71,3,12,5,"Coupled with iPhones 6s sales, that represents a sizable portion of current iPhone users that have yet to upgrade to the 6 or 6s, which AAPL could tap on when the next iteration is introduced."
72,3,12,6,"This was also mentioned previously by Tim Cook, with 60 of current iPhone users have yet to upgrade."
73,3,13,2,AAPL mentioned that there were more switchers from Android or other platforms to iOS in the 1HFY16 compared to any other sixmonth period ever.
74,3,14,2,"AAPL mentioned that India could be the next growth driver and market for iPhones, citing iPhone sales in India were up 56 yoy."
75,3,14,3,"While global smartphone market seems to have reached saturation point in developed nations, Indias LTE network is still rolling out, representing a large untapped market."
76,3,14,4,First timers are crucial to the Companys long term growth.
77,3,14,5,Each new user is a potential loyal AAPL user.
78,3,14,6,"Once the user becomes entrenched into its Ecosystem, the user could start engaging in its Services and purchasing other AAPL products."
79,3,15,1,"iPhone SE, released on 31 March was not included in 2QFY16s results."
80,3,15,2,"AAPL cites that demand for iPhone SE has exceeded its expected supply, leading also to the depressed 3QFY16 profit guidance."
81,3,15,3,"Should sales for the iPhone SE take off, it would be indicative of pent up demand for cheaper iPhones and an opportunity for AAPL to create further headway into developing markets."
82,3,16,1,"Should AAPL follow its previous release schedules and release the iPhone 7 around September end FY16, it could also entice the large pool of older iPhone users to upgrade as the iPhone 5 and 5s would be 2 product cycles old by then."
83,3,16,2,"However, the new iPhone 7 could only start contributing to its bottom line in FY17."
84,3,17,1,"Given these factors, we believe that while iPhones will face headwinds in the increasingly saturated developed nations smartphone market, the fears of peak iPhone are"
85,3,18,1,"overblown and believe that there is potential for iPhone sales to grow in the future, albeit at a slower rate."
86,3,19,1,"AAPLs tablet offering the iPad, used to account for about 18 of AAPLs total revenue."
87,3,19,2,"However, the rapid growth of iPhones and falling iPad sales has led to iPad now making up only 10 of AAPLs total revenue."
88,3,20,1,Tablets have longer replacement cycles compared to smartphones as consumers are less compelled to upgrade their tablets compared to smartphones.
89,3,20,2,"In 2QFY16, AAPL reported iPad sales were down 19 yoy with unit sales of 10.25 mn."
90,3,20,3,iPad sales were slightly better than consensus estimates which were on average about 9.95 mn.
91,3,20,4,"Of note however, the new 9.7 inch iPad Pro was only released at the end of Q2 2016 and sales figures would not have captured the full extent of demand."
92,3,20,5,AAPL expects the next quarter to be the best iPad quarter in two years based on their estimates.
93,3,20,6,"For now, we expect the iPad to continue accounting for a smaller component of AAPLs revenue over time."
94,3,21,1,"Macs are AAPLs laptops offering, they account for 11 of AAPLs revenue."
95,3,21,2,Mac unit sales have been on the uptrend over the past 3 years as the Macbook has gained popularity and more mainstream acceptance.
96,3,21,3,"However, Macbook sales fell 9 yoy in 2QFY16, which was worse than consensus estimates."
97,3,21,4,"However, a silver lining is that AAPL is gaining traction in China, where 80 of the Chinese Mac buyers were purchasing for the first time."
98,3,21,5,"Management has given guidance that it expects Mac sales to increase in 3QFY16 on the back of an updated Macbook, which was thinner and lighter with better specs."
99,3,21,6,"As one of AAPL core offerings, we expect Mac sales to maintain its share of revenue as it gains traction as a viable alternative to PCs."
100,3,21,7,"We believe that Mac sales will increase as compared to the iPad, despite both having similarly long replacement cycles compared to iPhone due to Mac having greater functionality."
101,3,22,1,"Apple Watch led to a 30 yoy growth in Other Product revenue, since it is a relatively new product offering, the Watch has generated new avenues of revenue for AAPL."
102,3,22,2,Whether the take up rate can continue or the Watch becoming like the iPad in terms of replacement rate remains to be seen.
103,3,23,1,Revenue from Services rose 20 yoy to US6 bn in 2QFY16.
104,3,23,2,Apple as a service is a concept that AAPL has taken large steps towards and is increasingly becoming the bright spot in the current environment of stalling hardware sales.
105,3,23,3,"Services create the Eco system which allows AAPL to further entrench its user base, creating more reasons for its stickability."
106,3,23,4,AAPL has been showing that it is increasingly able to monetize that active user base to generate more revenue from its services.
107,3,23,5,"In the 1QFY16, AAPL revealed that it had 1 bn active installed base, devices that were actively engaged in Services within that quarter, leading to Installed Base Related Purchases of US8.9 bn."
108,3,23,6,This figure grew by 27 yoy to US9.9 bn in the March quarter.
109,3,24,2,"Revenue grew by 35 yoy, generating 90 more global revenue than Google Play."
110,3,25,2,"Music grew from 10 mn to 13 mn paying subscribers since introducing a download and streaming model, leading AAPL to be optimistic that Apple Music revenue will start growing again moving forward."
111,3,26,2,"Being very new, Apple Pay is not expected to make significant contribution to AAPLs FY16 revenue."
112,3,26,3,"However, adoption rate is increasing exponentially, with transactions volume growing by 500 yoy."
113,3,26,4,"AAPL has launched over 2.5 mn locations that accept Apple Pay, with plans to expand further."
114,3,26,5,"While usage rates remain low, as the idea of NFC Near Field Communication payment is still new and not widely adopted yet, there is still much room for growth and eventually monetization."
115,3,26,6,"However, with credit card companies like Visa, as well as other phone companies like Samsung, are also heading into the space, the idea of NFC payments might not take that long to be legitimized."
116,3,26,7,"As such, we view this as an avenue with great potential in the future."
117,3,27,1,"Overall, we see great potential in Apple as a service."
118,3,27,2,"It remains the one category of revenue that AAPL has been able to achieve consecutive doubledigit growth, on average about 20, over the past 5 years."
119,3,27,3,"Services provide recurring revenue stream for AAPL that could grow independent of the unit sales, making it especially helpful in the current environment of slowing hardware sales."
120,3,27,4,We expect Services revenue to continue to grow and become a greater part of AAPLs revenue as upgrade cycles for iPhones stretch to 23 years.
121,3,28,1,"Of note though, is Chinas recent ban of AAPL iBooks and iTunes Movies, which could be a potentially worrying trend."
122,3,28,2,"Considering that if Services are to be the future of AAPL and Chinas important role in this strategy, then it would be a huge detriment to AAPLs future growth if the ban expands to the rest of AAPLs services."
123,3,28,3,"For now however, with just the iBooks and iTunes Movies ban, while worrying, it is not a large dent in AAPLs services growth and the thesis of Service growth should still hold."
124,3,29,1,"AAPL main revenue source by region comes from Americas, which makes up 40 of the total revenue."
125,3,29,2,"While Americas contribution to AAPLs revenue has been increasing on an absolute value, it has not been growing at a very fast pace."
126,3,29,3,"Americas revenue grew 4 in 2014 when total revenue grew 7, and grew at 17 yoy in 2015 when total revenue grew at 28."
127,3,29,4,It is likely that Americas revenue will continue to grow at a slower pace as compared to the total revenue.
128,3,30,1,"On the other hand, Greater China, which currently makes up 25 of its total revenue, has been rising at an incredibly fast pace."
129,3,30,2,"In 2014, Greater China only made up 17.4, this represents an 84 yoy increase."
130,3,30,3,"In the 2QFY16, China had a qoq change of 32 from 1QFY16, and a yoy change of 26."
131,3,30,4,"China was the main reason for AAPLs explosive growth in the previous year, growing by 84 yoy in FY15."
132,3,30,5,"In comparison, 2QFY16s results appears dismal, coming in at US12.5 bn vs previous years US16.8 bn."
133,3,30,6,"When seen against the backdrop of such a breakout year previously, it is not surprising that investors have reacted negatively to AAPLs performance this quarter in China."
134,3,30,7,"However, we feel that this is less of a slowdown and more of a normalization of AAPLs sales in China."
135,3,30,8,"AAPLs YTD revenue from China stands at roughly US30.8 bn, already almost as much as FY14, where revenue from China was US31.8 bn."
136,3,30,9,"As LTE network continues to expand in China and adoption increases, we expect Chinas demand for iPhones to continue to grow."
137,3,30,10,"However, whether China adopts the same replacement rate that Americas has had over the past years remains to be seen."
138,3,30,11,"Regardless, China should continue to be a growing source of revenue for AAPL."
139,3,31,1,"As mentioned earlier, India is also a developing market which could provide avenues of future growth for AAPL, sales having grown 56 yoy."
140,3,31,2,"As LTE networks continue to rollout, smartphones become more useable as compared to 2.5G or 3G networks, leading to increase demand."
141,3,31,3,"APAC ex Japan accounted only for US15 bn, being home to more developing nations, but as those nations continue to develop, AAPL should be able to take advantage of improvements in infrastructure to expand there."
142,3,32,1,"AAPL has amassed a large amount of cash, with US232.9 bn in cash and marketable securities as of 31 Mar 2016, up almost US20 bn yoy."
143,3,32,2,"However, 90 of this cash hoard is outside the USA."
144,3,32,3,"This is significant due to USA tax laws, which would cause AAPL to have to pay upwards of about US60 bn if it was to remit back to the USA."
145,3,32,4,AAPL has thus taken advantage of the current low interest rate environment to take on more debt.
146,3,32,5,"AAPL issued another US15.5 bn in USD notes in the latest quarter, bringing its debt level to about US72 bn."
147,3,32,6,"This puts its current net cash position at about US160 bn, which is equivalent to about US30 per share."
148,3,32,7,"Most of the borrowings has been put to fund the Capital return program, mainly dividends and share buybacks."
149,3,33,2,Attractive Capital Return Program Dividends and buyback increased .
150,3,33,3,"AAPL announced a further increase to its capital return program on 26 April 2016, increasing it to US250 bn from US200 bn in April 2015."
151,3,33,4,"The dividend was increased to US0.57 per share for shareholders on close of business 9 May 16, up c.10 from US0.52."
152,3,33,5,"Since AAPL started paying a dividend in 2012, it has increased the dividend each year consecutively, from US0.38 per share to US0.52, with a CAGR of about 8p.a."
153,3,33,6,"This represents a payout ratio of about 24, which is relatively low, indicating that there is still substantial room for future dividend growth."
154,3,33,7,Share repurchase authorization was also increased from US140 bn to US175 bn.
155,3,34,1,Valuation Methodology Discounted Free Cash Flow Model DCF model was used to derive a valuation of AAPLs intrinsic value.
156,3,35,1,"We have made the following assumptions for the model Headwinds in iPhone sales leading to decline and slow growth over the next two years, after which iPhone sales should start growing at a slower rate iPad sales may pick up in the next FY but repeat the cycle of slow replacement, leading to flat revenue Increase in Mac take up as Macbooks gain traction and more mainstream acceptance as PC and laptop replacements Service Revenue will increase as AAPL expands their ecosystem and continues to increase the monetization of their user base"
157,3,36,1,"We initiate coverage for AAPL with a Buy rating with a target price of US119.37 , derived from our DCF estimates."
158,3,37,1,Poor response to iPhone 7.
159,3,37,2,"While AAPLs customer base is very loyal, if iPhone 7 has a lacklustre showing and fails to excite that base, it could lead to even lower take up and a longer replacement cycle."
160,3,37,3,Weaker consumer sentiment amidst slowdown in the global economy could also negatively impact the take up of iPhones.
161,3,38,1,Slowdown in Services.
162,3,38,2,Services have been growing at an incredible rate and been the one bright spot in the 2QFY16.
163,3,38,3,AAPL transitioning into more of a Services company rather than a Hardware company also forms the basis for our estimates of future growth.
164,3,38,4,"If Services revenue slows down or if consumers fail to become entrenched into AAPLs ecosystem, it would adversely affect AAPL and our valuations."
165,3,39,1,"It is difficult to find a one to one comparison to AAPL in the US market, as while its peers do have some overlap with AAPL, there is also large differences between them."
166,3,39,2,"As such, we have chosen to show Google and Microsoft as peer comparisons."
167,3,39,3,"Google is relevant for the Android comparison and Microsoft is relevant for the Windows phone, PC and its recent move into a Service company as well."
168,3,40,1,AAPL remains the largest of the three companies by market cap.
169,3,40,2,"Based on PER, it is also the more undervalued stock amongst the three, trading at about 10x PER while the other two trade at more than 30x PER."
170,3,41,1,"AAPL, at US92.79, is also trading near its 52 week low of US91.85."
171,3,41,2,"Based on the Historical PER chart below, it is also trading at near 8 year low valuations."
172,3,41,3,"At US92.79, AAPL is trading at 10.32x PER as compared to its 5year historical average of 13.7x PER."
173,3,42,1,"AAPL gave poor guidance for 3QFY16, citing continued macro headwinds sending AAPL shares tumbling down."
174,3,42,2,"We expect AAPLs share price to remain depressed in the short term, while the market reacts bearishly to AAPL prospects and fears on iPhones saturation."
175,3,43,1,"However, AAPLs balance sheet remains strong with net cash at almost US160 bn, which works out to almost US30 net cash per share."
176,3,43,2,"At current prices, that indicates a net price US60 per share, indicating a c.7x FY16e PER."
177,3,44,1,"Additionally, its brand equity and loyal consumer base allows AAPL to continue to generate large profits and cash flow even in difficult seasons."
178,3,44,2,Its growing Services revenue is promising as it shows AAPL is making headway in their transition to a Services company.
179,3,45,1,"Therefore, we believe that the current knee jerk reaction in the market to AAPL is overblown, leading to AAPL being undervalued."
180,3,45,2,"As such, we initiate a Buy rating on AAPL with a Target Price of US119.37 , indicating about a 28 upside to the share excluding dividends."
181,4,1,1,"Nektar announced positive results from the Phase 3 SUMMIT07 study of NKTR 181, the companys proprietary novel abuse resistant opioid for pain."
