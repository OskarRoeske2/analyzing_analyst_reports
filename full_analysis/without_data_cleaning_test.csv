12,12,2,"Sum is more than the parts. A rare case of the sum being more than the parts, Salesforce continues to deliver on its broadening platform strategy. Ongoing strength in its core CRM product augmented by high growth in marketing, platform, and service, driving plenty of upsell opportunities, including the new Einstein AI engine. Along with increasing contribution from recent acquisitions, we are comfortable that the product portfolio can drive low to mid20s growth on a consolidated basis, which give us clear line of sight to 20B. A rare achievement.","{'Growth Strategy': 'positive', 'Product Strategy': 'positive', 'Revenue Growth': 'positive'}"

15,15,3,"Company Background Apples revenue comes from the iPhone 50 of FY20 revenue, iPad 9, Mac 10, wearables, home and accessories 11, and services 20.

16,16,3,"Investment Merits 1. 5G to drive record iPhone sales. Apples flagship 5G iPhone 12 lineup launched in 2020 sold 100mn units two months earlier than the iPhone 11. Volumes were close to its iPhone 6 supercycle during the 4G transition in 2015. Customers see 5G as a key reason for upgrading their iPhones after years of holding back replacements. Apples new iPhone 13 lineup is expected to be launched in September 2021, featuring up to 20 more efficiency and larger batteries to complement the powerhungry 5G phone. In anticipation of strong demand, Apple has ordered more than 100mn A15 chips from TSMC for the launch, 25 more than the 75mn chips for its 2020 iPhones. We expect the iPhone supercycle to continue, with FY21e and FY22e sales potentially topping 2015s record of 231mn units sold. This would be powered by upgrades from an estimated 48 of the iPhone users still using iPhone X and older. iPhone sales are Apples main cash cow, at 50 of sales in FY20.","{'Growth Drivers': 'positive', 'Revenue Growth': 'positive', 'Product Strategy': 'positive', 'Market Trends': 'positive'}"
17,17,3,"2. Margins to remain elevated. Strong growth in Apples services is expected to lift gross margins, together with higher ASPs of 5G devices in the product segment. Service margins of 66 are more than double product margins. Service revenue has also been expanding at a faster CAGR of 17 vs flat growth for iPhone. Growth is spearheaded by Apples evergrowing installed base, which topped 1.65bn in January 2021. Apple expects service growth to moderate after a bumper 3Q21 when YoY growth was 33 from the COVID19 rebound to more sustainable double digits. Apples 5G products also allow it to raise weighted ASPs by more than 20 from a year ago, boosting product margins. We expect gross margins to track above 40 in FY21e and FY22e, higher than their 5year historical average of 38.","{'Gross Margins': 'positive', 'Revenue Growth': 'positive', 'Product Strategy': 'positive', 'Growth Drivers': 'positive', 'Financial Performance': 'positive'}"
18,18,3,"3. Gaining market share through supplychain dominance. As competitors grapple with chip shortages, Apples share of global smartphone sales breached 5year highs, hitting 21 in 4Q21. In the highend market, Samsung was hit by its Texas semiconductor fabrication plants monthlong power shutdown and Vietnam factory suspensions due to COVID19. Samsungs new Galaxy Notes launch in 2H21 may be delayed as a result. Apple managed to mitigate shortages in 3QFY21, with the revenue impact coming in lower than its US34bn guidance. Apple holds buying power over suppliers through scale purchases and upfront cash payments, leaving competitors handling price shocks and shortages created by Apple deals.","{'Supply Chain': 'positive', 'Market Position': 'positive', 'Revenue Growth': 'positive'}"
