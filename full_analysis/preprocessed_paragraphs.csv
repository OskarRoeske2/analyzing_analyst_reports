0,1,"We maintain our Overweight rating and raise our price target to 75 Key Takeaway. Roger D. Read 6.5x 2023E EVEBITDA from 71. Through the combination of reating commodity prices, substantial opex reductions and signicantly restrained capex, XOM has thoroughly Lauren Hendrix Walker reversed the nearcatastrophe that was 2020. This time last year, investors were seriously questioning XOMs ability to sustain its dividend. On todays 1029 earnings call, XOM was able to illustrate how it can return net debt to preCOVID status by yearend 2021, modestly raise its dividend and reinstate a 10bn share repurchase program. Following the inline Q321 results and update to our Q421 and 2022 forecasts, we raise our 2021 and 2022 EPS estimates. Our newold EPS estimates for 2021 and 2022 are 4.954.56 and 5.394.48."
1,1,"We remain in the minority with less than a third of the analysts rating XOM the equivalent of buy. We believe the lack of enthusiasm stemmed from concerns about XOMs balance sheet and liquidity, ability to sustain its dividend and recent history of aggressive investmentpoor returns. In our view, recent results, BoD and senior management changes and the ability to restart a share repurchase program are quite supportive of our more positive views."

We estimate production of 3,635 mboed, or up 20 mboed versus Q3 2021. We lift our Q4 2021 downstream and chemicals margins on better cracks and an improved demand environment. We expect XOM to repurchase roughly 7bn in shares through 2023 while reducing debt. Given our more conservative oil price forecast, we do not expect XOM to repurchase the full 10bn over the next two years. We expect capex will be towards the lowerend of the 2025bn range in 2022 and move closer to the midpoint in 2023."

Companyspecic risks include operational production shortfalls, California regulatorytax hurdles, and civil strife in international locations."
9,1,"XOM We have an Overweight rating on XOM. Opex reductions combined with meaningful reversion to the mean margin performances at Chemicals and the Downstream supported by the fundamentals should allow XOM to generate 47bn of EBITDA in 2023 at just 60bbl Brent, 56bbl WTI and 2.75mmbtu natural gas. This level of EBITDA generation would be in between XOMs 2018 and 2019 performances which beneted from much higher commodity prices. We do not expect production growth and only minimal free cashow generation, which is inclusive of disposition proceeds. However, this represents a signicant change from the last several years of signicant cash burns and increased leverage. In our view, this is likely enough to lift the shares a bit higher and lessen worries about dividend sustainability and allow a resumption in share repurchases in 2022."

16,3,"Investment Merits 1. 5G to drive record iPhone sales. Apples flagship 5G iPhone 12 lineup launched in 2020 sold 100mn units two months earlier than the iPhone 11. Volumes were close to its iPhone 6 supercycle during the 4G transition in 2015. Customers see 5G as a key reason for upgrading their iPhones after years of holding back replacements. Apples new iPhone 13 lineup is expected to be launched in September 2021, featuring up to 20 more efficiency and larger batteries to complement the powerhungry 5G phone. In anticipation of strong demand, Apple has ordered more than 100mn A15 chips from TSMC for the launch, 25 more than the 75mn chips for its 2020 iPhones. We expect the iPhone supercycle to continue, with FY21e and FY22e sales potentially topping 2015s record of 231mn units sold. This would be powered by upgrades from an estimated 48 of the iPhone users still using iPhone X and older. iPhone sales are Apples main cash cow, at 50 of sales in FY20."
17,3,"2. Margins to remain elevated. Strong growth in Apples services is expected to lift gross margins, together with higher ASPs of 5G devices in the product segment. Service margins of 66 are more than double product margins. Service revenue has also been expanding at a faster CAGR of 17 vs flat growth for iPhone. Growth is spearheaded by Apples evergrowing installed base, which topped 1.65bn in January 2021. Apple expects service growth to moderate after a bumper 3Q21 when YoY growth was 33 from the COVID19 rebound to more sustainable double digits. Apples 5G products also allow it to raise weighted ASPs by more than 20 from a year ago, boosting product margins. We expect gross margins to track above 40 in FY21e and FY22e, higher than their 5year historical average of 38."
18,3,"3. Gaining market share through supplychain dominance. As competitors grapple with chip shortages, Apples share of global smartphone sales breached 5year highs, hitting 21 in 4Q21. In the highend market, Samsung was hit by its Texas semiconductor fabrication plants monthlong power shutdown and Vietnam factory suspensions due to COVID19. Samsungs new Galaxy Notes launch in 2H21 may be delayed as a result. Apple managed to mitigate shortages in 3QFY21, with the revenue impact coming in lower than its US34bn guidance. Apple holds buying power over suppliers through scale purchases and upfront cash payments, leaving competitors handling price shocks and shortages created by Apple deals."

20,3,"Apple has five revenue segments iPhone 50 of sales, Mac 10, iPad 9, Wearables, Home and Accessories 11, and Services 20. The first four are grouped under products. Wearables, home and accessories consist of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and other Applebranded and thirdparty accessories. Services are licensing, App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iTunes. Service revenue grew by a 17 CAGR from FY16 to FY20 to double from 9 to 20 of total revenue Figure 3. iPhone revenue was flat in the same period but is expected to surge in FY21 and FY22."

23,3,"Gross margins averaged 38 in the past five years. Margins for services averaged 61 in the past four years, almost double the product margins of 33. We forecast elevated margins for both services and products for FY21 and FY22 on the back of higher ASPs of new 5G devices and a higher installed base for services boosting operating leverage. Normalisation of freight costs could jack up product margins further."
24,3,"Assets Fixed assets increased modestly by 36 in the past five years to US37bn, roughly in line with revenue growth of 27 between FY16 to FY20. Fixed assets only comprised 8 of total assets as Apple outsources most of its manufacturing needs. Inventory grew 90 in the past five years to US4bn, likely due to Apples wider range of product lineups in recent years."
25,3,Liabilities Net debt averaged US19bn in the past five years. It was pared down to lower levels in FY19 and FY20 as fixed assets were flat in those years.
26,3,"Apple historically generates strong cash flows every year. Cash flow from operations in FY20 jumped 16 YoY to US81bn from a strong iPhone 12 launch.

Customers are primarily in the consumer, small and midsized business, education, enterprise and government markets. Apple sells its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its markets directly to customers through retail and online stores and a direct sales force. It also distributes indirectly through thirdparty cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. FY20 net sales through direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 34 and 66, respectively, of total net sales. No single customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Next is licensing, which includes payments from companies like Google to be featured on Apple products. Other services include AppleCare, which is Apples extended warranty service with a price range that depends on the product. iCloud generates revenue through subscription fees for use of cloud data. Apple Music also generates subscription fees as well as revenue from carrier partnerships. Apple Pay earns a percentage of transaction fees from users and banks. New to services and not yet meaningfully contributing are Apple TV, which earns subscription fees, and Apple Card, where Apple likely takes a cut of the interest charged by its partner bank."

34,3,"1. Antitrust laws could affect service revenue. Apple could lower its App Store fees for larger developers as a result of lawsuits. Apple last year lowered its fee to 15 for smaller developers making less than US1mn per year from their apps. But App Store revenue is largely driven by its larger developer base, contributing 30 fees."
35,3,"2. Chinas gaming crackdown could hit App Store spending. Chinas gaming revenue contributed an estimated US2bn or 13 to App Store revenue in FY19. That said, even if Chinas gaming crackdown intensifies, we believe the impact will be minimal as Chinas gaming revenue translated to less than 1 of FY19 revenue."
36,3,3. Chip supply shortage. Apple guided for a US34bn of impact from chip shortages earlier this year. This will affect iPhone and iPad sales in the coming quarter. There is a risk of the impact coming in at the higher end of the range.

We have adjusted a few of our underlying assumptions to better reflect the likely more challenging operating environment during 4Qi.e., increased pricing actions but more than offset by worsened supply chain pressures as well as updated FX outlook, which results in our totalorganic sales moving to 8.98.4, from 9.28.6 previously. Even after reducing this outlook, we are still ahead of the current Consensus Metrix and implied company guided 4Q organic growth of 7.6 and 7.1, respectively. From a bottomline perspective, our 4Q21 EPS of 1.53 remains unchanged and is ahead of current Bloomberg consensus of 1.52and, for what its worth the implied 4Q company guidance of 1.47 that is likely the bare minimum. We expect that underlying consumer demand remained strong at the end of the year and that the additional pricing actions in the fall began to flow though in the 4Q21 although more so in 1Q22 and help to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures. While some of the operational issues experienced in 3Q should have resolvedlessened e.g., FLNA plant disruption, Gatorade shortage, we would not be surprised to see other pain points in 4Q including potential for employee absenteeism impacting productionsupply and publicized snacks issue in UK relating to SAP upgrade. Netnet, our estimates imply a 6.6 twoyear organic sales CAGR, just in line with 3Q. Looking ahead to 2022, we think PEP got a good amount of credit for providing muchneeded visibility earlier in 3Q21 by committing to its longterm financial algorithm MSD top line and HSD EPS despite the significant inflationary pressures. As such,weare not expecting much of a surprise when the company provides official initial guidance now with 4Q earnings under its belt, although expected dilution from juice brands divestiture announced in August 2021 could lead to core EPS modestly below HSD growth were modeling for 5.2 organic topline and 6.1 EPS growth, or 7.7 predilution. As has been the norm from staples earnings so far, in particular HPC, the operating environment has arguably gotten incrementally challenging from a supply chain perspective near term, which is the main reason we are now more conservative, although we think PEP has enough levers to mitigate e.g., RGM, productivity. Netnet we expect continued solid performance from PEP, and its resilient and defensive business model is clearly in favor as evidenced by its outperformanceof late since 3Q results PEP 16.1 vs. XLP 11.1 and SPX 3.1, and while current valuation is making it tougher to see more meaningful upside in shares near term, we think PEP remains a core staples holding given its resilience of aboveaverage underlying topand bottomline growth and better visibility, which are the primary investment merits that investors look for in staples.."

Following a very strong year from a top line organic growth perspective in 2021 expectation to close the year at approximately 8 on top of 4.3 organic growth in 2020 despite pandemic impact, the company is expecting 2022 to be consistent with its longterm financial algorithm, which calls for MSD 46 organic growth. While the company moved past the worst of the pandemic impacts in 2021, the year was not without challenges, and with still recovering marketsand various supply chain issues through the year, we see continued runway for recovery and underlying growth in 2022 across segments excluding juice divestiture impact in PBNA given pricing actions and volume growth with improving supply conditions, recovering awayfromhome volumes, and resilient athome performance. At a high level, we think the underlying momentum driven by investments in marketing and innovation position the company well to deliver in line with its MSD organic growth targets, particularly given momentum in FLNA and PBNA which we discuss more in the note. All in, we are currently forecasting organic revenue growth of 5.2 volumesup 1.6 and pricemix up 3.6, which is very slightly ahead of Consensus Metrix consensus of 5.1."
60,5,"What Will Margins Look Like in 2022? PEPs ability to potentially drive margin expansion in 2022 despite the significant inflationary pressures being seen throughout the industry should set it apart from the majority of CPG peers and highlight the resilience and attractiveness of its business model, which calls for core operating margin expansion of 2030 bps per annum. PEP has solid visibility into expected cost pressures and has taken multiple rounds to price through higher inflation, including some over the summer and much more in the fall, with the full impact being seen in 1Q22. The company should also continue to execute against 1 billion annual productivity initiatives, which is mostly reliant on leveraging automation and digitization and should be particularly helpful in an environment with higher labor inflation. The divestiture of lowermargin juice business we estimate the business generated HSD EBIT margins will be a benefit to margins, which we estimate could be worth about 2030 bps to gross and EBIT margins. While the input cost environment continues to evolve, given the pricing and productivity efforts across the business, we think PEP can deliver about 20 bps gross margins expansion in 2022 roughly flat predivestiture and operating margin expansion of 65bps33 bps pre divestiture."
61,5,"Updated FX Outlook. With its 3Q21 earnings release, PEP reiterated its outlook for FX to be a 1 translational tailwind to both revenue and EPS, and since the day prior to that release October 4, 2021 FX has turned less favorable by about 60 bps for 4Q according to our currency model, and looking ahead to 2022, the impact of currency has gotten incrementally unfavorable by about 50 bps. Netnet for 2022, we would expect currency to be a headwind of about 1.

But even in a spin scenario, Ts RemainCo trades at 6.7x our 2022E RemainCo EBITDA and 6.2x EPS, with a 6.4 dividend yield. More encouragingly, we now have greater clarity on Ts path to 20B of FCF in 2023 based on the outlook.

For instance, T is guiding to 23B of combined FCF for FY2022, or 20B if you strip out a 3B contribution from WarnerMedia. Looking into 2023, cash capex will likely be 4B higher as they accelerate wireless and ber spending, but interest expense should be 1.6B lower and organic EBITDA, by our estimates, should grow 23B.

75,6,"T We have an Equal Weight rating on Ts stock, as we believe strength and execution in its core wireless business will oset some secular challenges in other business segments i.e. legacy wireline. With the WarnerMedia spinsplit looming, proforma T should be a healthier company with the opportunity to organically grow at a low to midsingledigit rate."
76,7,"Summary V reported FYQ4 adj EPS of 1.12, 5c above our estimate and 3c ahead of consensus. The beat vs our model was driven by lower incentives and slightly better cross border revs on fx volatility. Net revs were 5.1B, down 17 yy or 11 adjusting for the service rev lag. Net revs were slightly above our 4.97B est and consensus at 5.0B. Opex was 1.94B, a tad above our 1.92B est. Payment volumes were 4 yy vs down 10 yy last qtr. They repurchased 1.6B of stock during the qtr. Quarterly dividend increased to 0.32c."
77,7,"October Spend Volumes Steady Cross border volumes ex intraEurope stayed range bound and late October was down 37 yy, the same as early Septembers temporary pick up. US volumes showed modest improvement in October but that likely benefited from the Amazon Prime Day, so well view it as unchanged."
78,7,"2021 Guidance Mgt expects negative revenue growth in H121, then rebounding significantly in H221. Client incentives 25.526.5 though lower in Q1. This is an unusually high level of incentives for V and is a function of volume recovery price point. If processed trans and CB volume growth remains at October levels, theyd expect net revs to be down in the high single to low double digit range for FYQ1. Valueadded services up midteens in 21. Opex H121 down 5 or roughly equal to H220 level. Then midsingle digit growth in Q2 and double digit growth in H221 partly on Olympics."
79,7,"The Stock Solid qtr for V given the environment, but the results were a reminder that networks face earnings risk as cross border travel is still down hard. V noted that of 217 countries around the world, 74 still had complete or partial border closings, with most of the remainder requiring quarantine and COVID tests. This is at least some improvement from 87 last qtr. We expect some volatility as COVID levels increase, but we believe the longterm story remains intact and we are buyers through the weakness."
80,7,"Estimate Revisions We are lowering our 2021 EPS estimate to 5.35 from 5.90, reflecting a longer time frame for the cross border volume recovery. This is partially offset by lower operating expenses. Target down to 210 31x CY22 EPS est."
81,7,"Price Target 210 from 230 We rate Visa shares Overweight with a price target of 210. Our target is based on just over 36x our CY21 estimate of 5.72 and implies a 31x PE on our 2022 CY EPS estimate. The primary risks to our price target include heightened regulatory scrutiny, litigation, disintermediation from banks and emerging payment types, and adverse currency movements."
82,7,"We remain constructive on V and believe they are well positioned to rebound solidly once we get through the challenging global environment due to the virus. Quarterly spend trends improved through the quarter, and crossborder is showing signs of life. The pandemic pulled forward secular trends, such as online and digital, where V has greater market share."

84,8,APPLE EARNINGS PREVIEW DOWNGRADE TO HOLD AS SHARES HIT PRICE TARGET.
85,8,"PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART The risks seem balanced, to the upside and downside, with good news priced in."
86,8,"Shares of Apple have produced a total return dividends reinvested of 42.5 since our upgrade on April 22, 2013 compared to a total return of the SP500 index of 16.4 dividends reinvested. We are reducing our rating to HOLD from BUY as the stock has reached our 550 price target and we expect the performance of the stock to track more in line with the broader market index."
87,8,"We expect Apple to post an astounding quarter with over 80 million iOS units sold, powered by the view that the company makes the best products in the space. That said, we see that the market has already broadly anticipated a record quarter, and the upside risks seem balanced with downside risks in our view. Yes, we could be giving away some upside on the reaction to the December quarter print, particularly if the company can ship 5760 million iPhones or produce results with revenue and EPS around 60 billion and 15. That said, we see that expectations are again possibly overheating, particularly with regard to the opportunity with China Mobile. Additionally the market dynamic where the functionality gap between products is closing, while the price gap is widening remains an issue for Apple. Broadly speaking, the next 1 billion people purchasing smartphones are going to be from demographics less wealthy than the first billion, and the skew towards lower priced hardware is likely to continue. We do not suggest that Apple, as a highend brand, needs to chase after the lowend market, but we do suggest that the company introduce new products to its customer base."
88,8,"We remain positive on Apples ability to introduce wearable products that target the quantified self, a market we see as a natural fit to the Apple customer base. We are also positive on the potential for beacons and payments. We appreciate the concept of ultrahigh definition TVs, and the streaming potential for associated content from iTunes, but caution this type of product may capture less than the 10 market share suggested by certain investors in a recent SEC filing."
89,8,"It is also worth mentioning that one can argue that Apple is lagging in critical areas, with high profile wearable products from competitors already on the market such as Glass, inexpensive products such as Chromecast linking tabletsphonesPCs to TVs, and Apples approximately 575 million credit cards associated with iTunes an underutilized asset as it is not being broadly used for other payments."
90,8,"Valuation. While we appreciate that Apples shares may look appealing from a ratio perspective, trading at 12.3x our FY2014 earnings estimate, we mention again that Company Data earnings of companies in a fast moving technology landscape can change quickly. Apple remains that largest capitalized company on a U.S. listed exchange with its 493B valuation and as such we see the company as also being subject to selling for reasons outside of its fundamentals such as cash liquidation needs."
91,8,"Company guidance for the December quarter is 5558B in revenue, gross margin of 36.537.5, tax rate to be 26.25, other incomeexpense of 200M and operating expense of 4.44.5B."

107,11,"Verizon was the fourth straight carrier to beat wireless subscriber expectations. Sub trends, which accelerated yy on a"
108,11,"tough comp, were expected to be robust after the company launched its muchanticipated Disney promo in December."
109,11,"However, cost growth once again came in above expectations which led to a miss on wireless EBITDA margin. While VZ"
110,11,"has suffered from this more than other carriers throughout the year, and part of this is due to accounting, this theme has"
111,11,appeared to have picked up this quarter industrywide. The company also missed its service revenue growth guidance.
112,11,"Going into 2020, VZ will no longer report Wireless segment results separately, which will make it difficult to benchmark"
113,11,organic margin trendlines. This could make for a tricky dynamic given that margin expansion expectations continue to
114,11,fall but visibility will be limited beginning next quarter.
115,11,Sub beat potentially driven by promos VZ postpaid phone net adds of 790k beat our already optimistic
116,11,expectations of 747k consensus 652k with the second derivative accelerating yy. Much of this strength appears to
117,11,aggressive in the handset promotion market as well as on Black Friday. While perhaps some had expected stronger
118,11,"performance on the Disney front considering headlines around Disney initial sub ramp, we do acknowledge that"
119,11,"Disney likely had much more significant uptake on the existing phone base rather than driving gross adds. In addition,"
120,11,"last years Q4 benefited heavily from the successful iPhone launch, which we estimate could have created a comp"
121,11,headwind by as much as 100200k subs. If we assume this impact from last years iPhone on top of organic growth say
122,11,"50k, this implies that Disney itself could have added 200250k subs in the quarter. While this is optically rather"
123,11,"small relative to the 20mm Disney sub number, we do acknowledge that the sub tailwind was over only one month and"
124,11,it appears that the bundle has had a larger impact on existing account churn. While postpaid phone churn rose
125,11,"seasonally as per usual 4bps qq, the magnitude was much lower than T, TMUS 12bps each and S 13bps. This"
126,11,would imply that the tailwind to Disney from Verizon came from existing VZ subs which could have contributed 34mm
127,11,"to Disney subs in the quarter overall. If this estimate is borne out, then Verizons contribution to growth for Disney"
128,11,next quarter will need to be more gross add heavy given the already high penetration of existing base that is eligible.
129,11,"However, Q1 tends to be a seasonally weak quarter for phone net additions which makes this tougher."
130,11,Revenue guidance misses The company surprisingly missed wireless service revenue guidance 2.7 vs. guidance
131,11,of 33.5 despite ARPA coming inline. Part of this could be due to account penetration growing faster than expected
132,11,3.27 vs. 3.25 linesaccount est. as a result of Disney and other promotions which dragged on ARPU despite ARPA
133,11,coming in better. Another explanation could potentially be wholesale revenue growth slowing on a yy basis. The dynamic
134,11,which is likely to get tougher is the tailwind from cable MVNO revenue growth which should slow because of lapping the
135,11,Charter launch. The competitive environment for retail also looks set to be tougher in 2020 given ATT comments and
136,11,"launch of HBO Max. The course of the STMUS deal could add further to competitive headwinds. Consequently, 2020"
137,11,single digits may need to lean a lot more on equipment revenues. The ending of Disney promotions second half of next

143,11,"TMUS began aggressively retaking share and when handset upgrade rates were at their last peak. The difference,"
144,11,"however, in industry fundamentals between then and today is quite large in that VZ margin remained flat in 2019 during"
145,11,a relatively benign competitive environment with upgrade rates at an alltime low. This has negative readthroughs
146,11,heading into the next two years where competition is beginning to heat up and VZ will have difficult cost of service
147,11,"comps in the first half due to Disney. Execution and visibility, the fountainheads of VZ equity performance, are also"
148,11,likely to be bigger issues given that the company will no longer report wireless segment margin separately.
149,11,"Wireline deteriorating faster For several quarters now, wireline EBITDA has disappointed to the downside and this"
150,11,trend appears to have no signs of abating anytime soon. The magnitude of the miss this quarter was quite material with

183,14,"While PYPL posted a 4Q18 adjusted earnings per share beat 0.69 versus the consensus estimate of 0.67 and our estimate of 0.66 some investors were apparently disappointed that the companys revenue of 4.23bn fell short of the consensus estimate of 4.24bn 12month target even as it was near the midpoint of managements guidance range.

185,14,"O ur focus heading into PYPLs 4Q18 print had been on total payment volume TPV, payment transaction volume, monetization of social peertopeer app Venmo and new account growth, and the digital payments network shined in all four."
186,14,"Valuation Our 95 price target for PayPal is based on 17x the companys FY20E adjusted EBITDA of 5,891mm. The multiple we employ is based on comparablecompany analysis."
187,14,"PYPLs TPV increased by 25 year overyear on an FXneutral basis to 164bn while payment transaction volume increased by 28 to 2.87bn. That rate of growth was down from the 28 rate of TPV growth that the company had posted in 4Q17 which management attributed in large part to zero growth from eBAY EBAY, Not Rated PYPL s TPV ex.EBAY was up 29 during the quarter."
188,14,We believe PYPLs lack of TPV growth from EBAY during 4Q18 and the fact that the companys Merchant Services revenue has grown at a rate 6x that of its revenue from EBAY since 2015 should help to ease whatever sting remains from EBAYs decision announced last January to replace PYPL with Adyen ADYEN NA as its primary payments provider in 2020. Management noted that Venmo during 4Q18 surpassed EBAY in terms of TPV on PYPLs platform.
189,14,"Meanwhile, PYPL during 4Q18 added a record 13.8mm new active accounts, up 58 versus the prior year period, including 2.9mm stemming from the companys 2018 acquisitions. Management attributed the surge in growth to its partnerships including 40 bank led marketing campaigns to drive consumers to PYPLs platform, and they said they see significant runway ahead in that metric."
190,14,"Perhaps most encouraging among PYPLs 4Q18 highlights was that 29 of Venmos users had engaged in a monetizable experience through December, up from 24 in 3Q18, 17 in 2Q18 and 13 in May. That figure made even more meaningful the 80 increase in volume to 19bn that Venmo reported during 4Q18, in our view."
191,14,Management during todays conference call said Venmo had a revenue runrate greater than 200mm at YE18. They noted that the figure was split between Instant Cash Out and commercerelated revenue.
192,14,PYPLs number of payment transactions per active accounts on a trailing 12month basis increased 9 yearoveryear to 36.9. This increase is important inasmuch as a key part of the companys growth strategy is to increase engagement among existing customers with a goal of motivating users to engage its platform 23 times a week versus 23 a month.

194,15,"GM will host an Investor Day on November 17th. GM already hosted a special Cruise Colin M. Langan event and test drive in September therefore, we expect the investor day to focus on its EV strategy. We also expect the company to provide some broad 2023 guidance Tim Liu and possibly provide midterm margin guidance vs. 2030 target last year. The media has already reported that GM will announce EVs will be profitable by 2025. We remain skeptical that EVs can be sustainably profitable by 2025 even with IRA help, though Kosta Tasoulis pricing raw mat assumptions will be key. The timing of the event is pretty challenging, as GM will likely focus on long term, but investors are keenly focus on the near term. Moreover, we suspect near term color on 2023 might be more negative pension, mix, etc. We remain UW."
195,15,"Current consensus adj EBIT for 2023 is 10.9B vs. 2022 guidance of 1315B and our 9B estimate. GM is expected to provide some color on 2023 drivers, but not full guidance. We expect most updates will be headwinds as consensus still looks too high in our view. We are optimistic that production will rise in 2023 with improved semi supply, and GM will also benefit from the recent decline in raw material costs, which implies part of the 5B in 2022 headwinds should reverse. That said, there are also numerous challenges into 2023 including likely price decline from record levels see Exhibit 2, normalization of vehicle mix see Exhibit 1, lower pension income est. 1B headwind, continued EV investment costs, FX, and the UAW contract negotiations."
196,15,Can GM deliver on EV profitability by 2025?
197,15,"At the last Investor Day, GM promised ICE like EV margins by 2030. Since then, battery raw material costs have dramatically spiked therefore, it would be surprising if GM can still see EV profitability by 2025. While IRA is a meaningful help, we remain skeptical that EVs will be sustainably profitable by 2025. We estimate EV SUVs will be 2,850 lower profit than a comparable ICE vehicle. More concerning, we estimate EV pickups will be 12,375 lower profit than a comparable ICE pickup. Key factors to understand around EV profitability will be the pricing assumption vs. ICE, raw mat assumptions, and the inclusion of other costs advertising, marketing, RD, etc."
198,15,"At the last investor day, GM guided to doubling sales expanding margins to 1214 910 precrisis by 2030. Given investors were disappointed by the lack of midterm guide posts, we expect GM to provide midterm guides this year. We suspect any 23 year margin targets would be consistent with 910 historic margin vs. longterm targets as it takes time for SaaS to scale."
199,15,"Investment Thesis We rate GM as Underweight. GM is the largest US automaker by market share and actively invests in autonomous technology, electric vehicle development, and connected car capabilities. However, we believe that the rise in battery raw material costs has negatively impacted the outlook for BEV profitability, and consequently, GMs profitability. Moreover, US fuel economy regulations will likely force automakers to sell BEVs to meet targets. Overall, we see limited nearterm catalysts as the normalization of new vehicle pricing and higher input costs likely offset expected volume increases. In addition, we also see headwinds from the 2023 UAW contract negotiations. Target Price Valuation for GM 30.00 from NC Our 30 price target is based on 2.0x 2023E core EBITDA and 10B for its Cruise stake. Our base case reflects an 5 yy increase in FY 2022E global production 12 N America, 6 Europe, 4 China. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for GM Notable upside risks to our price target and rating include 1 A meaningful decline in battery raw material prices. 2 Fasterthanexpected easing of semiconductor and supply chain challenges. 3 New vehicle pricing sustaining its current record strength for longer than expected. 4 The successful launch of key EV products such as the Cadillac Lyriq, GMC Hummer EV, Chevy Silverado GMC Sierra EV, Chevy Equinox EV, and Chevy Blazer EV. 5 Successful expansion of Cruises autonomous rideshare technology across the US."
200,16,EBAY EARNINGS REVIEW THE TAX MAN COMETH
201,16,"PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Haiku The earnings were fine, but the changes to the cash, has investors spooked."
202,16,"eBay shares are down approximately 5 on the heels of solid March quarter results and June quarter guidance. Investor concern is centered on a charge the company is taking that allows the firm to repatriate its overseas cash for domestic use. The concern is that the company is positioning for a sizeable domestic acquisition that might require both the issuance of debt and the repatriation of its cash. We mention that the company has not committed to repatriating its overseas cash, and is merely setting up the option, but it is a valid question of why make the move if there is no plan to use the cash. While we would likely not support acquisitions of privately held companies such as Square or Pinterest, we mention that the current management has a respectable track record with its prior acquisitions. The largest targets have been Skype in 2006 for 3.1B, GSI Commerce in 2011 for 2.4B and PayPal in 2002 for 1.5B. The GSI Commerce deal is the only one of the three that has been executed by the current management team, and we mention that this team has not historically grossly overpaid for assets."
203,16,Ebay reported March quarter revenue of 4.26B which represents growth of 13.7 YoY and a decline of 6 sequentially and compares to our estimate of 4.23B. EPS of 0.70 was growth of 12 YoY and was above company guidance of 0.65 0.67 and above our estimate of 0.68. We highlight the following
204,16,"Second quarter FY14 guidance given by the company states revenue expected between 4.325B to 4.425B and EPS of 0.67 to 0.69. The company also maintains its 2014 full year guidance, with revenue expected between 18B and 18.5B and EPS of 2.95 to 3.00. Our 2014 estimate of revenue is at 18.3B and our EPS is at 2.98."
205,16,Marketplace revenue in the March quarter was 2.15B 10.1 YoY with a segment margin of 39.7. Total gross merchandise volume GMV exauto was 21.5B and showed growth of 12.1 YoY. Active buyers globally accelerated to 145M 14 YoY with 11.4 YoY growth in sold terms. US GMV exauto grew 10.8 YoY to 8.1B.
206,16,"Total Payments revenue in the March quarter was 1.84B 19.2 YoY, with a segment margin of 25.7. PayPal continued the momentum from the December quarter in the March quarter, with 148.4M 16.2 YoY active accounts and exceeding 1B in revenue for the twelfth consecutive quarter. Net number of payments increased 22.4 YoY to 834M. Penetration on eBay was up 200 Company Data basis points."
207,16,6.5M new users were added to eBays mobile purchase in the March quarter. Mobile enabled commerce volume grew 70 to 11B in Q114.
208,16,"Balance Sheet, Estimates and target We increase our FY14 and FY15 eps estimates maintain our BUY rating and our price target of 59 on shares of eBay Inc. eBay trades at 18x our FY14 estimate with 7.8B in cash 5.99 share, 4.1B longterm debt and 1.1B in cash from operations as of March 31, 2014."
209,17,"Our review of omnichannel retailer commentary and EBAYs upward 2Q guidance revision last week indicate to us continued strength, if not acceleration, in digital commerce from March into April and May, despite brickandmortar retailers beginning to reopen across much of the country. While it is too early to tell whether ecommerce penetration will permanently ratchet higher, strong digital demand appears likely to persist over at least the near to midterm. While digital demand appears to have ramped aggressively, we also note omnichannel retailers have rapidly launched or expanded local fulfillment capabilities leveraging store footprints, and have so far seen an enthusiastic consumer response e.g., TGTs sameday services 278 YoY in its F1Q20. What does this mean for our mostly pureplay ecom coverage? Our view is somewhat mixed, but positive on balance we view accelerating growth and persistence of digital demand as strong positives that likely outweigh enhanced fulfillment capabilities among omnichannel players."
210,17,"AMZN Raise Estimates, Raise PT to 3,000. While we note ramping local fulfillment capabilities and exceptionally strong e commerce data pts from omnichannel retail competitors, we nonetheless expect that AMZN is likely to benefit from exceptionally strong ecommerce demand in 2Q, likely extending into 2H20. Though we view omnichannel retailers recent progress on BOPIScurbside as very much worth monitoring, we believe that AMZNs continued buildout of lastmile fulfillment capacity and a gradual return to more hectic work and school schedules among consumers will likely shift momentum back toward rapid delivery AMZNs 1day Prime and Prime Now from competitors storebased fulfillment options. Based on our increased forecasts and improving comparative valuations, we have raised our price target to 3,000 23x 2021E EVEBITDA from 2,725 prior and maintain our Overweight rating on AMZN shares."
211,17,"Estimate Changes. We have raised our ecommerce paid unit growth forecasts for the remainder of 2020 and 2021, and have also modeled higher 3P unit mix vs. our prior forecasts. For 2Q, we now forecast 35.5 unit growth revised upward from 27 prior, and accelerating vs. 32 unit growth reported in 1Q20 and 5446 3P1P unit mix, consistent with 2Q19. Unit growth and 3P mix are also revised upward for 2H and, modestly, for 2021. For 2020, we now forecast revenue of 349B, GAAP Op Income of 11.4B and GAAP EPS of 15.59, vs. prior forecasts of 343B 11.1B 15.11. For 2021, we now forecast revenue of 415B, GAAP Op Income of 24B and GAAP EPS of 35.57 vs. our prior forecasts of 401B 23B 34.51."
212,17,"Price Target 3000 from 2725 Our valuation is based on a sumoftheparts analysis. Our 3,000 price target represents 23x 2021E EVEBITDA. Risks include ongoing investment in Amazons infrastructure both on the AWS and Retail sides of the business, entries into new retail categories where Amazon is less experienced, competition from traditional brick and mortar players, and challenges expanding into newer international markets such as India."
213,17,"We remain confident on AMZNs ability to drive penetration of additional retail product categories and key emerging geographies, maintain its lead in cloud computing and execute against additional opportunities such as online advertising across both endemic and nonendemic advertiser categories, which we believe offer the company compelling growth and profit characteristics."
214,17,"Amazon.com, Inc. offers services to consumers, sellers, and developers through its retail websites. It also manufactures and sells the Kindle ereader. The Company offers programs that enable sellers to sell their products on its websites and their own branded websites.

In addition, the Company generates revenue through cobranded credit card agreements and other marketing and promotional services, such as online advertising. Amazon.com has organized its operations into two principal segments North America and International."
215,18,"Today 53, we hosted a post Q1 earnings call with Fords CFO, John Lawler Fords Colin M. Langan President of Americas and International Markets Group, Kumar Galhotra and Fords Head of Investor Relations, Lynn Tyson. While the Q2 semirelated production cuts were disappointing, it is a onetime issue, and we remain upbeat about the potential of the underlying business. We also are optimistic heading into the May 26th investor day with likely positive updates on EV and connected car strategies. There were three key highlights from our call."
216,18,"1 Despite 3 fold increase in lost units, Ford held the impact to the high end of guidance"
217,18,"Coming out of Q1, investors were unclear how to frame the size of the guidance cut. Ford claried original guidance for the semi impact was 12.5bn, reecting the loss of 200400k units. Post the Renesas re the number of units impacted rose to 1.1m, yet the impact was contained at 2.5bn. Ford highlighted the underlying performance for the business is running at the original 89bn excluding the semi supply issue."
218,18,2 Sounds like Ford will not be alone in the Q2 semiconductor supply impact
219,18,"In our recent semi supply chain update note, we highlighted VCs guidance of production of down 1827 qq, implies Ford 30 qq might not be a large Q2 outlier. On our call today, we got the same impression. While Ford could not speak directly to competitors, the company thinks it too early to say they are more impacted. Ford highlighted most of the chips are supplied in modules sourced by the shared global supply chain, therefore, it would be surprising that only Ford would see a large impact if other automakers depend on these same suppliers. Ford also indicated cuts are now made on relatively short notice, as supplier schedules are changing weekly vs. monthly. This may explain why the large cut surprised most forecasters. Visibility into the semi supply chain is very challenging given there are several layers of companies between the semi manufacturers and the automakers. It is unclear how much semi inventory had been held at suppliers, though most suppliers are likely depleted of buer stocks as this point. We also note that over the last few days, more cuts were announced. According to Auto News, GM extended downtime at Fairfax Malibu to July 5, Lansing Camaro, CT45 is down next week until June 28, and CAMI Equinox is down until June 28. VW indicated it lost 100k units in March and that shortages will intensify in Q2."
220,18,3 Ford is making strong progress on warranty costs
221,18,"Ford reported a 400m yy decline in Q1. The CFO noted there was nothing one time driving that improvement. In addition, the warranty change was mostly driven by normal coverage, not recall related which may be more lumpy. This indicates positive performance should be sustained if current quality holds. Ford also indicated that warranty could improve as the company leverages their connected capabilities to do over theair OTA updates, which have already been done on the Mustang MachE."
222,18,"We remain OW on Ford given signicant margin upside driven by new higher prot products trucks and SUVs, the acceleration in its restructuring actions, and lower warranty."
223,18,How will Ford emerge dierent from supply issue?
224,18,"Ford is focused on learning from this supplier chain crisis. There are three key areas Ford will operate dierently going forward. One, the company is assessing its supply chain and determining where more buer stock may be needed going forward. Two, the company has learned how to better manage sales with low inventory levels, and therefore will keep inventory lower than historic levels post crisis. Three, Ford is more focused on a seamless online order system, having developed an improved reservation system during the crisis."
225,18,"Ford has indicated it will announce another 2.5bn in restructuring actions by yearend. The company has already announced 2.5bn of actions related to the Brazil plant closures announced in January accrued in Q4. We think it sounds like the facilities in India might be at risk as this is the only region that was unprotable for International. Ford has indicated it will wait until the second half of the year to provide an update on India. International margins of 8.9 in Q1 were impressive considering India was unprotable. While Ford downplayed the potential for closing another plant in Europe, we still see the Focus plant as at risk."
226,18,"Ford will host an investor day on May 26th. We expect an update on its electric, autonomous, and connected strategies. While Ford has highlighted the need for vertical integration in EVs, we expect the company to still partner on cells, though develop and maintain propriety cell IP though Ford Ion Park. We are optimistic Ford may surprise on its connected strategy. Ford already plans to release BlueCruise on the MachE and F150 via an OTA update in the second half. More importantly, Ford discussed the lifecycle engagement of the vehicle. Automakers that can successfully engage customers over the vehicle life will likely see signicant benets around loyalty which is massively underappreciated given the high auto marketing spend."
227,18,"We are Overweight Ford as the new CEO is nally executing on the long awaited turnaround plan which should focus the company on protable businesses. The company should also see tailwinds from a very strong launch lineup with the new F150, the Bronco Sport, and the Bronco. In addition, while Ford is considered a laggard on future mobility trends, in our view recent actions show the company is leading. Their AV partner, Argo AI, is likely among the top 5 autonomous leaders the MachE is a proof point that Ford is serious about EVs and now that its vehicles are connected, we are seeing the rollout of connected features. Our 15 price target is based on 3.25x 2022E EV to EBITDA."

Nevertheless, given its numerous growth and monetization initiatives, which are in the early stages, we remain condent in PYPLs ability to achieve or modestly exceed its longterm targets of 25 TPV and 20 revenue growth. Our 2021E revenueEPS move up to Estimates Higher. 25.75B4.73 from 25.74B4.70. Our 2022E revenueEPS move up to 31.56B 5.90 from 31.15B5.76. Following Q3 the most dicult eBay compare, we expect revenue growth to accelerate as eBay headwinds lessen and new initiatives begin monetizing. Our 2022 revenue estimate implies 23 growth."

230,19,"Revenue of 6.24B, up 19 up 17 FXN, essentially matched our estimate Q2 Recap as lower transaction revenue was oset by higher OVAS revenue. Transaction revenue of 5.8B up 17 was a touch below our 5.9B estimate as higher TPV was more than oset by a lower take rate. We would note PYPLs guidance for the remainder of 2021 implies a modest decline in the transaction take rate from Q2 to Q3 before strengthening from Q3 to Q4 as the eBay headwind lessens, new monetization initiatives take hold, and PYPL recognizes a modest benet from upcoming pricing adjustments. OVAS revenue of 441MM exceeded our 359MM estimate as PYPL noted strengthening credit performance. PYPLs As mentioned previously, excluding eBay, Q2 revenue was up 32. operating prot of 1.65B was a touch above our 1.62B estimate as higher transaction expense higher TPV and a slightly higher transaction expense rate was more than oset by lower transaction and loan less expense and lower nontransactionbased expenses, which still grew 27 as PYPL invests to capture opportunities created by the accelerated shift to digital payments. Operating margin of 26.5 was 50 bps above our estimate but down 170 bps from the prior year. PYPL noted a 360MM decline in transaction margin dollars from the eBay transition during Q2. EPS of 1.15, up 8, modestly exceeded our 1.12 estimate."
231,19,"Our 350 price target implies PYPL trades at about 22x our 2022E revenue, net of transaction expense. This represents about 0.9x our 20202025E revenue CAGR of 23. While this is at the upperend of its highgrowth FinTech and software peers, we believe it is justied given our condence in the strength and durability of PYPLs organic growth prole."

The exchange offer expired on Friday. An aggregate principal amount of 288.7m at maturity of the old notes, representing 82.5 of the old Notes, were validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn. Ciena Our View In the prospectus filed on Friday 728, the company mentioned that it has not made a determination that it will use the treasury stock method to account for these modified converts. However, we note that if the company decides to use the Treasury method it will help reduce dilution from the converts and boost estimated EPS looking forward by around 6 for the consensus on our calcs.

343,25,"We are revising up our FY15 revenue estimate to 5.37B from 5.35B and our EPS estimate to 0.52 from 0.50. We are also adjusting our F16 revenue estimate to 6.47B from 6.57B and our EPS estimate to 0.65 from 0.66 to reflect the newly initiated F16 guidance. At the end of the day, we continue to believe that managements decision to reinvest incremental margin to drive growth opportunities and market share gains next year and beyond makes sense given the predictability and natural leverage of the SaaS model and given key secular trends and competitive leadership."

This issue is certain to us frontloaded spending for less certain back Christopher Spahr ended benets. JPM continues to reect our Goliath is Winning theme, but the cost and time frame for doing so is greater and longer than expected. Indeed, there was zero assurance that this historic increase in expenses will level o after this year. Moreover, Robert Rutschow we believe JPM is more expensive than the average bank at a time when other banks are more pure plays on our 2022 theme, NII to the Sky. We continue to favor the banks featured in our new report, 2022 Outlook Stay Aboard the Bank Train. Eric Chan To us, JPM is spending the benets of rate increases, which Expenses are the issue. should keep its ROTCE below its target of 17 for the next few years. JPM guides for 8 higher expenses in 2022 due to inationcompTE normalization 40 and deliberate increases in investments 60, implying a second year in a row of negative operating leverage. While JPM indicated that it intended to gain market share in each business, it gave few other concrete metrics around future expectations even though investments targeted 15bn in 2022 are set to increase by 30 YoY and by 57 since 2019."
374,27,"The degree of downside Big reduction to estimates given companyspecic moves. to our estimates is a surprise to us after reviewing our earnings model. We est. ROTCE declining to 15 and not getting to 17 over the next 3 years due to higher expenses, lower fee revenue in CIB and Consumer, and less buybacks thats even while the company should show the best NII growth in its history guided 12 higher core in 2022. The decline in our PT follows our est. revision downward."
375,27,"We dont see how the math works otherwise with the increase in expenses this year, especially since JPM gave no assurance that expenses would not continue to increase after 2022. Specically, JPM is projecting expenses to increase 6bn while core NII is projected to increase 5bn and the company is coming o record revenue in CIB. Netnet, we est. 2022E revenue to be up 1 while expenses are up 8 core. As a result, we lower our estimates for 2022 to 11.25 from 12.65, 2023 to 12.30 from 14.35, 2024 to 14.00 from 16.25, and 2025 to 15.50 from 18.05."
376,27,"Good longterm company, but perhaps too long of a horizon for bank stock investors, especially without more detail. This is not to say the wheels are coming o. On the contrary, JPM continues to gain market share along with progress, like the industry, in NII, loans, and mergers. Indeed, a midteens ROTCE is still decent. Nonetheless, at a time when most banks should show improving pretax prot margins, JPM is likely to go in the opposite direction over the next 12 years. In the end, we feel that the burden is on JPM to give more specics about its expected benets since they are incurring certain expenses for uncertain benets."
