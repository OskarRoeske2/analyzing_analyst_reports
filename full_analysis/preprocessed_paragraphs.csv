0,1,"BOTTOM LINE We and almost every other investor we have spoken to over the years, has been framing the AMZN SOTP valuation wrong. Amazon advertising is only 5 of revenues, but is far greater contributor to overall nonAWS EBIT margins than the street recognizes. Said differently, If advertising was viewed as a standalong business unit we will explain why it shouldnt be, it would represent well north of 300 of 2020E nonAWS EBIT."
1,1,"Based on our view that there is massive upside by 2024E, we increase our PT to a Street high of 4,500 based on an average of our 2024 SOTP and 30x our 2024 EBIT power of 91bn vs. our inprint estimates of 71.5bn and the street at 69bn both of these are modeled back at 10, Overall, we think Previous BUY investors are materially underestimating the earnings power of the business. We are going to be good bulls not all our colleagues always are and not factor all of the goodness in our estimates. We wanted to frame a highly likely outcome, as well as dynamics of the AMZN business that we this not totally Previous 3,925 appreciated. As a long time buysider, I think one of the most important values the sellside can bring is reframing an underappreciated dynamic. We dont think we are going to disappoint."
2,1,"We would highlight that this is not a shortterm call. We do think Street estimates for fulfillment in particular are modeled too low in H121 based on the companys message that they are embarking on another fulfillment center investment cycle made loud and clear in our view on the 2Q20 call. Also, we all know eCommerce has seen a massive acceleration from the pandemic, but can imagine guiding could be challenging. Long term, we would bet that over a 4year period a Long AMZN Short the market position will be handsomely rewarded."
3,1,"Everybody who is using a SOTP model for AMZN is doing so incorrectly ourselves too. We also are not huge fan of SOTP models because the Buyside or Sellside makes inaccurate conclusions, but in AMZNs case think is necessary. Why we are not a fan These SOTP analyses are often done as means to justify that a company is worth more than it is currently trading at, but let us be clear. Analysts may lie the market doesnt lie and the associated price a stock currently trades at is what it is. It can turn out to be true, taking the case of Icahns successful push to separate PYPL from EBAY. We would argue there are a lot more reasons that untethered from EBAY, PYPL has been able to transform into a different business than it would if still owned by EBAY. But back to our initial point, analysts may lie stocks dont lie. Massive kudos to whomever bet alongside Mr. Icahn, but this has been a grand slam home run, with PYPL alone at a 230bn mkt cap. We do not remotely subscribe to the thesis that AWS profits highly profitable and quantifiable are being used to subsidize retail losses."
4,1,"SOTP debates aside, we would all concur that more disclosure is better than less disclosure. This typically leads to multiple expansion given investors greater understanding of the different moving pieces of complex businesses. Examples we would cite are BABA cloud and offline have been huge drags on a highly profitable core business, NFLX domestic is highly profitable vs international, and GOOG most recently took a cue from some of these other megacaps. Ironically, AMZN over the last few years has gone from the megacap disclosing the least to the one disclosing the most."
5,1,"Now lets chitty chat AMZN. We think the street often tries to ascribe different multiples to AWS they certainly should, advertising, subscription, FBA, GMV, 1p revs, 3p revs etc. You name it, somebody has done it. The only reported FACTS we have about OI is AWS, Domestic and International so all the other assumptions are being made by the Street."
6,1,"We have historically modeled for our SOTP 1 Domestic and 2 International GMV we gross up the 3 party GMV and admittedly are making an assumption on the take rate, as it likely has only continued to uptick given FBA growth, 3 AWS, 4 Advertising, and then have applied a holding company discount."
7,1,"We believe you could nitpick our approach to international GMV. That said, we believe 1 The company remains in aggressive investment mode particularly in India and suspect this market alone is a large of the international losses"
8,1,"2 Based on our channel work, we are of the view that most of the Western European markets are doing MSD OI margins 3 Unlike China, which was a guaranteed unwinnable fight for AMZN relative to Chinese natives like JD, and BABA, there was a zeroprobability chance the Chinese government would allow ecommerce to be dominated by a foreign player. 4 By comparison, we think the Indian government is way more foreign business friendly, and valuing the company on retail OI god knows how many assumptions you need to make to come up w a clean retail OI number would attribute no value to international revenues."
9,1,"We would advocate the investors should essentially look at the business in two primary buckets AWS and Everything Else So why do we think so? AMZN is probably the company that penned the term Flywheel or certainly made it pervasive in the investment and operating communities. What do we mean? Lets start to dissect by reporting line. Retail The 1p and 3p businesses, while with different margin structures 3p is much higher and reported only as the net take, are intimately intertwined. They benefit from the same endcustomer base. With FBAs continued expansion and penetration as a of the 3P business, they often share the same warehouse space, as well as the same logisticsdelivery providers. They share the same payment processing and benefit from the same marketing. We have long put zero stock in trying to look at one vs. the other. FBA increasing as of the mix is good for retail margins and AMZNs take rate, but to our SOTP comment, we are not going to try and put a different multiple on one vs. the other. Subscription Prime Sweet Sweet AMZN Prime. While we get that investors love subscription businesses because they are sticky, recurring, and have much greater degrees of predictability, AMZN Prime is all about the flywheel. There may be a small base of Audible users or more on the come with its recent Luna Cloud gaming service announcement, but end of the day the subscription business at 19.2bn in 2019 is all about Prime. Back to our Flywheel comment, the Prime business exists because of the robust selection, and value proposition it represents to end consumers. And to further sweeten the deal, AMZN over the last 57 years has only further increased the value of a prime subscription by including an increasingly robust offering of streaming video, streaming audio and most recently, 1day shipping. On the other side of the network effect, the larger the Prime subscriber base, the more enfranchised sellers are in participating in AMZNs FBA Fulfillment by Amazon program. Having the Prime Enabled logo next to your item, is a key driver to a shoppers propensity to click. So back to our comments about Retail, Prime and Retail are intimately intertwined. Within that context, we think ascribing a value to Subscription in SOTP separately also makes no sense Advertising As we have framed in our earlier notes about AMZNs ad business, 1 We think they are the only online player really benefiting from trade budgets today, 2 We believe there was an evolution internally in which AMZN found the right advertising business for AMZN. We estimate at least 8590 of the AMZN business today is sponsored listings. In this scenario, an advertiser pays for higher placement within the product sort order, the user stays on AMZN, and AMZN keeps the transaction and transaction data. To use CPG as an example we think by far the largest advertiser vertical on AMZN, we think PG, Unilever, Energizer companies that dont have a real DTC strategy view advertising on AMZN to be not so different than paying for favorable shelf placement at WMT, TGT, KR, etc. The reality is, this is a where their customers are, b has better quantifiable results than the offline analog, so have been happy participants. We think that AMZN could become more aggressive with AMZN Firepotentially giving the TV device away to further drive their video inventory, but think that this hasnt happened yet but who knows prime day is around the bend, but a development worth closely watching. Similar to Retail and Prime, we think investors have potentially thought through the Ad business as being a separate business unit, but we think that it sits under the broader retail umbrella to a greater degree than investors recognize. The ad business doesnt exist without retail."
10,1,"So why does this all matter? Lets do a little fun math. 1 FY 2015 North America margin was 4.3, international was 0.3 2 The FY 2015 Other revenue line in totality was 1.7bn with advertising likely 1.21.3bn, 3 Street estimated GAAP EBIT is 69bn for 2024 In our view, 2016 was the year advertising had the real break out with Other revenues growing 74 yy and advertising growing, we estimate, 90 yy. For context, our estimate of advertising was 13.8bn in 2019, growing 41 yy to 19.4bn in 2020. Now this is where it gets interesting based on our channel work, and some common sense, we estimate that advertising EBIT margins if it were a stand alone are north of 80, and believe that could even be CONSERVATIVE. Running this math based on 2019 actuals, NonAWS EBIT was 5.3bn, and"
11,1,"Advertising if looked in isolation would be 11bn implying that the rest of the business is losing money??!?!?!?!?! We actually think of this as a huge positive not a negative. As we stated under bullet 4, we think that there is AWS and Everything Else so we look at advertising as another part of the Flywheel. Valuation is often more of an artform than pure science, but end of the day what matters is what is the underlying earnings potential of the business. In our view, we think the key exercise for valuing AMZN, is to do is the following Take AWS Revenues and EBIT estimates for 2024 newly published today we are at 100bn in revenues and 34.5bn in OI Assume the standalone advertising business does 52bn and an estimated margin of 75 lets assume they do more around CTVFire TV so the margin goes down from predominantly sponsored products, that is 39bn! So combined, between these two lines, we are already at 73.5bn in EBIT If we assume that the nonad components of the north American retail biz are able to get back to a 4 EBIT margin as they were in 2015 North America was 4.3, we would get on our estimates of retail revenues of 19.5bn All in, this is 93bn of EBIT Earnings Power vs the street at 69bn 14 EBIT margins vs the street at 10 Assuming we are correct, by 2024 investors wont need to do these financial acrobatics, because the underlying report EBIT of the busines will show up flowing through the income statement."
12,1,"Lets entertain the negative side and see where we could be wrong. Do you mean to say AMZN is back to its old days of selling things at a loss? And dont they always find a way to keep spending? Well yes and no. We think this comparison to 2015 margins is a decent proxy to think through earnings power, and are expect international EBIT will be positive by then as well. We do see a few big step function potential costs that are worth framing, and want to discuss where our logic could be wrong. There has been a huge amount of incremental investment into the business with fulfillment having slowed in 1918 in terms of order of magnitude yy dollar growth pretty substantially we think there is a massive step up this year Content costs a straight up gross margin headwind have increased substantially and potentially could again We actually think a more logical owner of things like NFL rights at the next round of negotiations is more likely to be AMZN, AAPL or GOOG relative to the current rights holders as we suspect we have hit a negative inflection point with linear viewingcable subscribers. We also think that the potential for one of these tech companies, who each have MASSIVE international audiences to have a big impact on the leagues international presence and brand would likely only further drive this this would be a huge step up in content costs One day shipping evolves into same day shipping as we have been writing about since initiating on AMZN last year, we have viewed one day shipping as a step along the road on the way to inevitable same day shipping a clear incremental driver of incremental cost headwinds. The grocery category is clearly one of the last uncaptured categories of huge TAM particularly in the US. We think that the elements of fresh product, different fulfillment center needs in part because of perishable, are subscale at this point. But would highlight that 1 we think Bezos world view is that he wants AMZN to own as large a percent of the consumers wallet as possible if they dominate in grocery, they will have largely achieved that, 2 groceries are arguably to last category within which AMZN is not dominant, so see fewer negative new category introduction headwinds and 3 we are assuming AMZN can ultimately get to a 34 EBIT margin in grocery at scale. Logistics? we have been of the view for several years, that AMZN has ambitions to compete with FDXUPS in the top US citieswhere they have the most density. We think investors have been paying for some of these investments along the way, and think that AMZN has pulled back midCovid from their intentions to compete with the thirdparty carriers, but think this is a function of necessity given the incredible high level of demand for all eCommerce companies. We would be shocked if AMZN is not in market well in advance of 2024 pricing below their peers. Overall, we think this competitive push would be a headwind to EBIT, but would be favorably viewed as a new leg of the AMZN story. The ad business is more mature than we appreciate. We think that the ad biz grows correlated with GMV and while we have estimated GMV growth of 13 in 2024, and ad growth at 20, potentially we are overestimating the headroom in the business."
13,1,"In summary, we think that most of these potential large pockets of investment exfulfillment buildout would likely be seen as incremental drivers of revenue growth, so to the extent EBIT numbers are too high, we would suspect the revenue numbers are likely too low. AMZN longterm skeptics will respond to an analysis such as this that they always manage to spend away the upside, but if grocery is in fact the last frontier category, we think they will"
14,1,"WHERE WE COULD BE WRONG 1 AWS continues to slow faster than we expect, 2 3 party fees at 26.7 for 2018 we model their exit run rate for Q4 at 27.3 see material pressure. AMZN began reducing some fees over the last 2 months we are nervous that they could actually be way too high, but dont know how to handicap magnitude, 3 offline retail is able to strike back harder than we appreciate we are surprised WMT already had its wheels in motion in terms of a response 4 we are underestimating the size of the investment cycle. Incremental investment for oneday is impacting shipping costs if they really want to get this right, it could be a material investment in fulfillment too."
15,1,"RISKS 1 Over saturation of AMZN within eCommerce, 2 macroeconomic deceleration causes greater than expected declines in commerce, 3 AWS slows materially, and 4 antitrust action."
16,2,We are issuing this special report due to the following factors 1 The continued moral bankruptcy of Central Bankers around the globe. 2 The fact that we continue to receive questions regarding AMZNs stock price and our divergent recommendations. 3 Our continuing need to educate investors regarding the importance of our Bitcoin Gold Dow Theory in this age of Monetary Disorder 4 Natural adjustments to price and valuation targets in light Amazons operations and Central Banker largesse since our last report.
17,2,"In order to properly understand our recommendation, one must understand our Bitcoin Gold Dow Theory analysis framework, which is an effort to understand the differences between nominal and real prices in the modern economy. This framework holds that the modern analyst should measure prices in relation to gold for tangible assets and measure the market value of intangibles in relation to bitcoin to derive real prices and real estimates of economic activity and values."
18,2,"Under our Bitcoin Gold Dow Theory analysis framework, there are three ways overvalued stock prices can return to fair value. 1 Share prices can fall 2 Share prices can remain the same while the companies increase their underlying value value and price converge in the future 3 The value of money falls this could result in an increase in nominal share prices but a decline in the real purchasing power of the shares."
19,2,"Since the time of our previous report, the price of money as measure by gold and BTC has declined and Amazon has increased its underlying value. Since our Sept 4, 2018 Sell recommendation, AMZNs share price has declined 4.98 in nominal prices and declined 27.99 relative to BTC and declined 19.83 relative to gold."
20,2,"Since the time of our initial July 24, 2017 Sell recommendation, AMZNs share price has risen 86.46, while BTC has risen 241.88 and Gold has risen 12.76. Thus, in real prices as measured by BTC, AMZNs share price has declined by 45.46 since our initial Sell recommendation while our USD price recommendation has been incorrect. Using GLD against AMZNs tangible book value and BTC against the difference between AMZNs market value and book value, AMZNs share price has fallen 39.9 close to our original estimate of a 37 overvaluation."
21,2,"At the time of our initial report July 24, 2017, Amazon was valued at 1025.67 while BTC traded at 2779 or a ratio of .369. We had a price target of .04 BTC, 640, or .11 gold oz which implied a BTC price of 16,000, a gold price of 5800, or a decline in Amazons share price in USD. We point this out given that our initial BTC target was surpassed in December 2017. Based on todays level of monetary insanity we have a BTC target of 20,568 and a gold price target of 6,652. At todays BTC price of 9,500.71 the ratio of Amazons share price to BTC is .201 and while Amazons share price to gold ratio is roughly 1.42."
22,2,"Fintrust Brokerage Services is raising our Sell rating to Hold , and we are raising our nominal price target price from 1,111 current USD to 1,611 on the basis of our dividend discount model and current interest rates. Our target prices relative to BTC is .078 and our gold relative target is .24 gold ounces in our real purchasing power price estimates. This represents 15.7 nominal downside from todays price of 1,911."
23,2,"As repeatedly stated in our reports, our estimates are naturally wide given we are in the midst of the largest money debasement in a Western country, since John Law in 1720 or the German hyperinflation of . Our valuation calculations under various scenarios range from a low of 1170 to a high 2550 per share in current USD. The wide range of estimates is the natural outgrowth the companys high growth rates and historically low interest rates. Discounted cash flow models for high growth companies in a negative to near zero interest rate environment return nearly infinite prices for the value of an equity that invests cash today and promises cash tomorrow because cash today has nearly no value, while cash later, if it materializes, has potentially large value."
24,2,"Using Valueline, we calculate that Amazon has realized a 10year historical growth rate in equity of 28. In addition to our own analysis, we used Valuelines 2020 earnings estimate of 35.60 and projected cashflows forward for 20 years and then discount those earnings back at 6 and added this sum to Valuelines estimated 2019 book value estimate 131.55 to derive a fair value estimate of 2,011. At the current 1,911 per share price, we estimate that the market is discounting Amazons like a 20year monopoly that will sustain a 16 growth rate."
25,2,"While we understand the markets pricing for AMZN, we continue to note that one of historys other great trading, logistics and information monopolies, the Dutch East India company, realized returns of 18 for 200 years, after being granted a 21year monopoly, but its earnings and dividends were irregular in amount and form. In addition, we note that the companys stock price reached a record low dividend yield of 3.5 and record stock price high of just over 1100 per share, during the period that coincided with the peak insanity of John Laws monetary system in 1720. Using Valuelines 2020, 70.25 per share cashflow estimate for each Amazon.com share and dividing by 3.5 we derive a 2007 price. Importantly for price targets, Amazon.com retains its earnings, whereas the Dutch East India Company distributed its earnings source globalfinancialdata.com, as a result, the share price, book value, and our estimates of fair value would be expected to continue to increase over time."

28,3,". Apples comments on the potential establishment of Other 1 Subscription Model broadbased consumer hardware subscription service is a clear focus among investors. We think the establishment of such a model will be viewed as providing support for the company to maintain a 2530x forward PE multiple. Bloomberg has reported that Apple could roll out a monthly hardware subscription model in late 2022. As a reminder, on 331 Apple ocially launched its Business Essentials for SMB commercial customers starting at 2.99 per devicemo with 50GB of storage up to 24,99 per usermo. covering up to 3 devices and 2TB of storage. We will be focused on Apples 2 Supply Chain commentary around its supply chain following reports of signicant disruptions in its Chinese suppliers related to COVID lockdowns.

Investors remain enthusiastic on the growing Prime ecosystem, and the fastgrowing Amazon Web Service AWS that showed surprisingly strong profitability when the company first started breaking it out in the March quarter. Regarding AWS, we mention that the nature of this business is high volume, low margin.

47,4,"North America We expect revenue from the North America segment to be at 13B in the quarter for 59 of total, 19 YoY growth and segment operating income of 525M. We expect Media to grow in North America at 17 YoY for 22 of North American revenue and EGM electronics and other general merchandise revenue to grow at 20 YoY, accounting for 77 of North American revenue."
48,4,"International We expect revenue from International segment to be 8B in the quarter with a growth of 3 YoY growth. We expect Media revenue to grow at 2 YoY to provide 32 of total, and EGM to grow at 3 YoY providing 67 of International revenue."
49,4,"AWS We expect revenue from companys Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business is expected to be 1.6B, for 7 of total revenue and growth of 53 YoY. Company Data Media EGM We expect worldwide Media revenue to grow at 10 YoY to 5B for 24 of total revenue. Electronics and Other General Merchandise EGM revenue estimated at 15B, 14 YoY growth. This segment is the growth engine for the company and expected to account for 68 of total revenue."
50,4,Guidance Guidance for GAAP operating loss in Q2 2015 is a range from a loss of 500M to a profit of 50M. Revenue guidance is net sales between 20.6B and 22.8B 7 to 18.
51,4,"Balance Sheet and Estimates. AMZN has 14B in cash 29.64share and longterm debt of 8B as of March 31, 2014. Cash flow from operations was a negative 1.5B during the quarter. We adjust our FY15 estimates and maintain our FY16 estimates, maintain a HOLD rating and adjust our price target to 475 from 425 on shares of Amazon Inc."
52,5,212 5273523 We are not changing our 2018 CY EPS estimate of 12.00 or price target of 198 as a lower tax rate assumption of 15 vs prior estimate of 19 was offset by lower gross margin estimates and lower contribution from Other income and expenses.
53,5,"As we previewed in our note last week Link, FQ2 revenue guidance was 60 billion compared to a consensus estimate of 68 billion just a week ago. The consensus estimate implied a sequential rise in ASP in FQ2, but CFO Luca Maestri poured cold water on that theory during the call. We now estimate a 6.5 qq decline in ASP in FQ2 versus our prior estimate of a 3.9 decline and yet CFO Luca Maestri appeared to 12 month target be guiding to an even lower ASP."
54,5,"For ASPs, theres also another element that we need to consider. As you know, our newest products this year have higher ASPs than they had in 52 week range the past. And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest Dividend Yield products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline Market Cap m sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically. Luca Maestri, Apple CFO, 2118, FQ1 2018 conference call"
55,5,"Consensus numbers will be coming down for Apple, but as we suggested last week, Apple still generates impressive revenue growth. We estimate 15 in the March quarter and 10 for the Calendar year."
56,5,"Based on CFO Luca Maestris comments, it appears that Apple added 4.2 million iPhones into the channel. Its highest quarterly inventory addition ever."
57,5,"We exited the December quarter towards the lower end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of iPhone channel inventory, with less than 1 million more iPhones in the channel compared to the December quarter a year ago , in line with our growth in average weekly unit sales. Luca Maestri, Apple CFO, 2118, FQ1 2018 conference call"
58,5,The 796 iPhone ASP was higher than we expected in the quarter. Here is our best guess on unit mix.
59,5,"As a result, we are bumping up our FQ2 iPhone ASP by 25 to 745 and lowering our unit estimate by 1 million to 52 million, which lifts our FQ2 total revenue estimate by 500 million to 60.9 billion, the midpoint of the guidance range of 6062 billion."
60,5,"We increased our Calendar 2018 revenue estimate by 700 million. A 2.0 billion increase to iPhone revenue on higher ASP assumptions was partially offset by lower estimates for Mac unit sales and services revenue. Its notable that we are cutting Services revenue and that growth was under 20 despite the focus of this line item early in the call. We cut some unit growth from our iPhone expectations, but expect low single digit unit growth each quarter."
61,5,"The weak guidance for FQ2 gross margins caused us to cut our GM estimate for Calendar 2018 by 70 basis points to 38.3, a 10 basis point contraction from 2017."
62,5,"We bumped up our RD estimate by 700 million for the year. It grew 19 this quarter and regularly outpaces our estimates. We expect RD to represent 5.3 of revenue in Calendar 2018, up from 2.8 in Calendar 2013. No one on the call asked about what the RD priorities are, but we did get a lengthy description of the HomePod, even though Other Products represented 6.0 of revenue in Calendar 2017."
63,5,Our Calendar 2018 EPS estimate would have been cut to 11.44 from 12.00 if the company had not guided to the 15 tax rate versus our 19 estimate.
64,5,Share repurchase finally rose to 10 billion and we expect it to stay at those levels in future quarters in order to hit our target.
65,5,"Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital structure for our company. Our current net cash position is 163 billion, and given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time. We will provide an update to our specific capital allocation plans when we report results for our second fiscal quarter, consistent with the timing of updates that we had provided in the past. Luca Maestri, Apple CFO, 2118, FQ1 2018 conference call"
66,5,Our 10 billion estimate of quarterly share repurchase might be prove to be too low based on CFO Luca Maestris comments above. If Apple bought 15 billion of stock back each quarter it would lift our 12.00 EPS estimate up to 12.19.

68,6,"Company Background Apples revenue comes from the iPhone 50 of FY20 revenue, iPad 9, Mac 10, wearables, home and accessories 11, and services 20. Main markets are the Americas 45, Europe 25, Greater China 15, Japan 8, and the rest of Asia Pacific 7."
69,6,"Investment Merits 1. 5G to drive record iPhone sales. Apples flagship 5G iPhone 12 lineup launched in 2020 sold 100mn units two months earlier than the iPhone 11. Volumes were close to its iPhone 6 supercycle during the 4G transition in 2015. Customers see 5G as a key reason for upgrading their iPhones after years of holding back replacements. Apples new iPhone 13 lineup is expected to be launched in September 2021, featuring up to 20 more efficiency and larger batteries to complement the powerhungry 5G phone. In anticipation of strong demand, Apple has ordered more than 100mn A15 chips from TSMC for the launch, 25 more than the 75mn chips for its 2020 iPhones. We expect the iPhone supercycle to continue, with FY21e and FY22e sales potentially topping 2015s record of 231mn units sold. This would be powered by upgrades from an estimated 48 of the iPhone users still using iPhone X and older. iPhone sales are Apples main cash cow, at 50 of sales in FY20."
70,6,"2. Margins to remain elevated. Strong growth in Apples services is expected to lift gross margins, together with higher ASPs of 5G devices in the product segment. Service margins of 66 are more than double product margins. Service revenue has also been expanding at a faster CAGR of 17 vs flat growth for iPhone. Growth is spearheaded by Apples evergrowing installed base, which topped 1.65bn in January 2021. Apple expects service growth to moderate after a bumper 3Q21 when YoY growth was 33 from the COVID19 rebound to more sustainable double digits. Apples 5G products also allow it to raise weighted ASPs by more than 20 from a year ago, boosting product margins. We expect gross margins to track above 40 in FY21e and FY22e, higher than their 5year historical average of 38."
71,6,"3. Gaining market share through supplychain dominance. As competitors grapple with chip shortages, Apples share of global smartphone sales breached 5year highs, hitting 21 in 4Q21. In the highend market, Samsung was hit by its Texas semiconductor fabrication plants monthlong power shutdown and Vietnam factory suspensions due to COVID19. Samsungs new Galaxy Notes launch in 2H21 may be delayed as a result. Apple managed to mitigate shortages in 3QFY21, with the revenue impact coming in lower than its US34bn guidance. Apple holds buying power over suppliers through scale purchases and upfront cash payments, leaving competitors handling price shocks and shortages created by Apple deals."

73,6,"Apple has five revenue segments iPhone 50 of sales, Mac 10, iPad 9, Wearables, Home and Accessories 11, and Services 20. The first four are grouped under products. Wearables, home and accessories consist of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and other Applebranded and thirdparty accessories. Services are licensing, App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iTunes. Service revenue grew by a 17 CAGR from FY16 to FY20 to double from 9 to 20 of total revenue Figure 3. iPhone revenue was flat in the same period but is expected to surge in FY21 and FY22."

Operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses 7 of sales and research and development 7. Over the past five years, SGA consistently ranged at 67 of sales, while RD grew from 5 to 7 of sales. Total operating expenses grew at a 8 CAGR."
76,6,"Gross margins averaged 38 in the past five years. Margins for services averaged 61 in the past four years, almost double the product margins of 33. We forecast elevated margins for both services and products for FY21 and FY22 on the back of higher ASPs of new 5G devices and a higher installed base for services boosting operating leverage. Normalisation of freight costs could jack up product margins further."
77,6,"Assets Fixed assets increased modestly by 36 in the past five years to US37bn, roughly in line with revenue growth of 27 between FY16 to FY20. Fixed assets only comprised 8 of total assets as Apple outsources most of its manufacturing needs. Inventory grew 90 in the past five years to US4bn, likely due to Apples wider range of product lineups in recent years."
78,6,Liabilities Net debt averaged US19bn in the past five years. It was pared down to lower levels in FY19 and FY20 as fixed assets were flat in those years.
79,6,"Apple historically generates strong cash flows every year. Cash flow from operations in FY20 jumped 16 YoY to US81bn from a strong iPhone 12 launch. Much of the cash was used for stock repurchases of US72bn in that year. Meanwhile, capex averaged US11bn in the last five years, largely stable."

Customers are primarily in the consumer, small and midsized business, education, enterprise and government markets. Apple sells its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its markets directly to customers through retail and online stores and a direct sales force. It also distributes indirectly through thirdparty cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. FY20 net sales through direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 34 and 66, respectively, of total net sales. No single customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Next is licensing, which includes payments from companies like Google to be featured on Apple products. Other services include AppleCare, which is Apples extended warranty service with a price range that depends on the product. iCloud generates revenue through subscription fees for use of cloud data. Apple Music also generates subscription fees as well as revenue from carrier partnerships. Apple Pay earns a percentage of transaction fees from users and banks. New to services and not yet meaningfully contributing are Apple TV, which earns subscription fees, and Apple Card, where Apple likely takes a cut of the interest charged by its partner bank."
83,6,"The highend smartphone market is predominantly served by Apple and Samsung. Huawei has fallen out of the ranks following U.S. sanctions.

87,6,"1. Antitrust laws could affect service revenue. Apple could lower its App Store fees for larger developers as a result of lawsuits. Apple last year lowered its fee to 15 for smaller developers making less than US1mn per year from their apps. But App Store revenue is largely driven by its larger developer base, contributing 30 fees."
88,6,"2. Chinas gaming crackdown could hit App Store spending. Chinas gaming revenue contributed an estimated US2bn or 13 to App Store revenue in FY19. That said, even if Chinas gaming crackdown intensifies, we believe the impact will be minimal as Chinas gaming revenue translated to less than 1 of FY19 revenue."
89,6,3. Chip supply shortage. Apple guided for a US34bn of impact from chip shortages earlier this year. This will affect iPhone and iPad sales in the coming quarter. There is a risk of the impact coming in at the higher end of the range.

96,7,"The Negatives Supply constraints and FX to impact revenue growth. A couple of headwinds are likely to continue from 2Q22 into 3Q22. For Products, AAPL expects supply constraints to continue, although at slightly lower levels compared to 2Q22 affecting Product margins. A strengthening US dollar relative to most other currencies is also likely to provide approximately 6 of negative headwinds for revenue growth."
97,7,"Outlook Supply chain constraints will ease, and strength of the US dollar will continue to hurt margins. AAPL expects 3Q22 revenue growth to accelerate compared to 2Q22, despite FX headwinds. The company also guided gross margins between 41.5 and 42.5, with operating expenses of US12.9bn13.1bn."
98,7,"Demand for AAPL products is likely to remain resilient, with customers switching over to iPhones. At the same time, more than half of the customers who purchased its other products Mac, iPad, Wearables, were new to the product, a trend we expect to continue moving forward, especially with the new M2 chip release and new iPhone release later this year."

327,13,"PepsiCo PEP, Overweight rated is scheduled to report 4Q21 earnings results on Thursday, February 10, before the open. We have adjusted a few of our underlying assumptions to better reflect the likely more challenging operating environment during 4Qi.e., increased pricing actions but more than offset by worsened supply chain pressures as well as updated FX outlook, which results in our totalorganic sales moving to 8.98.4, from 9.28.6 previously. Even after reducing this outlook, we are still ahead of the current Consensus Metrix and implied company guided 4Q organic growth of 7.6 and 7.1, respectively. From a bottomline perspective, our 4Q21 EPS of 1.53 remains unchanged and is ahead of current Bloomberg consensus of 1.52and, for what its worth the implied 4Q company guidance of 1.47 that is likely the bare minimum. We expect that underlying consumer demand remained strong at the end of the year and that the additional pricing actions in the fall began to flow though in the 4Q21 although more so in 1Q22 and help to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures. While some of the operational issues experienced in 3Q should have resolvedlessened e.g., FLNA plant disruption, Gatorade shortage, we would not be surprised to see other pain points in 4Q including potential for employee absenteeism impacting productionsupply and publicized snacks issue in UK relating to SAP upgrade. Netnet, our estimates imply a 6.6 twoyear organic sales CAGR, just in line with 3Q. Looking ahead to 2022, we think PEP got a good amount of credit for providing muchneeded visibility earlier in 3Q21 by committing to its longterm financial algorithm MSD top line and HSD EPS despite the significant inflationary pressures. As such,weare not expecting much of a surprise when the company provides official initial guidance now with 4Q earnings under its belt, although expected dilution from juice brands divestiture announced in August 2021 could lead to core EPS modestly below HSD growth were modeling for 5.2 organic topline and 6.1 EPS growth, or 7.7 predilution. As has been the norm from staples earnings so far, in particular HPC, the operating environment has arguably gotten incrementally challenging from a supply chain perspective near term, which is the main reason we are now more conservative, although we think PEP has enough levers to mitigate e.g., RGM, productivity. Netnet we expect continued solid performance from PEP, and its resilient and defensive business model is clearly in favor as evidenced by its outperformanceof late since 3Q results PEP 16.1 vs. XLP 11.1 and SPX 3.1, and while current valuation is making it tougher to see more meaningful upside in shares near term, we think PEP remains a core staples holding given its resilience of aboveaverage underlying topand bottomline growth and better visibility, which are the primary investment merits that investors look for in staples.."
328,13,"Framing TopLine Expectations for 2022. Following a very strong year from a top line organic growth perspective in 2021 expectation to close the year at approximately 8 on top of 4.3 organic growth in 2020 despite pandemic impact, the company is expecting 2022 to be consistent with its longterm financial algorithm, which calls for MSD 46 organic growth. While the company moved past the worst of the pandemic impacts in 2021, the year was not without challenges, and with still recovering marketsand various supply chain issues through the year, we see continued runway for recovery and underlying growth in 2022 across segments excluding juice divestiture impact in PBNA given pricing actions and volume growth with improving supply conditions, recovering awayfromhome volumes, and resilient athome performance. At a high level, we think the underlying momentum driven by investments in marketing and innovation position the company well to deliver in line with its MSD organic growth targets, particularly given momentum in FLNA and PBNA which we discuss more in the note. All in, we are currently forecasting organic revenue growth of 5.2 volumesup 1.6 and pricemix up 3.6, which is very slightly ahead of Consensus Metrix consensus of 5.1."
329,13,"What Will Margins Look Like in 2022? PEPs ability to potentially drive margin expansion in 2022 despite the significant inflationary pressures being seen throughout the industry should set it apart from the majority of CPG peers and highlight the resilience and attractiveness of its business model, which calls for core operating margin expansion of 2030 bps per annum. PEP has solid visibility into expected cost pressures and has taken multiple rounds to price through higher inflation, including some over the summer and much more in the fall, with the full impact being seen in 1Q22. The company should also continue to execute against 1 billion annual productivity initiatives, which is mostly reliant on leveraging automation and digitization and should be particularly helpful in an environment with higher labor inflation. The divestiture of lowermargin juice business we estimate the business generated HSD EBIT margins will be a benefit to margins, which we estimate could be worth about 2030 bps to gross and EBIT margins. While the input cost environment continues to evolve, given the pricing and productivity efforts across the business, we think PEP can deliver about 20 bps gross margins expansion in 2022 roughly flat predivestiture and operating margin expansion of 65bps33 bps pre divestiture."
330,13,"Updated FX Outlook. With its 3Q21 earnings release, PEP reiterated its outlook for FX to be a 1 translational tailwind to both revenue and EPS, and since the day prior to that release October 4, 2021 FX has turned less favorable by about 60 bps for 4Q according to our currency model, and looking ahead to 2022, the impact of currency has gotten incrementally unfavorable by about 50 bps. Netnet for 2022, we would expect currency to be a headwind of about 1.

Ecommerce risk is shifting to foodconsumables, hard discount poses a threat, traditional competitors are beginning to ght harder, and the cost of doing business in retail continues to rise.

Results were not well received, with AAPL share price taking a tumble by more than 6 on the next market day. iPhone units sales were slightly above consensus expectations but revenue and EPS came in below consensus estimates. This marked the first time iPhone sales have fallen. Poor results along with poor profit guidance for the quarter ahead, which is far below consensus estimates, led to the drop in share price. AAPL has experienced a 10.5 decline in share price over a 1 year period."
585,21,"Fall in revenue and earnings. AAPL reported quarter revenue of US50.6 bn, missing consensus estimate by US1.37 bn and EPS of US1.90, missing by US0.10. Gross margin was 39.4 vs 40.8 yoy."
586,21,"Services were the saving grace. AAPL reported US6 bn in revenue for Services, an increase of 20 yoy. It cited growth in its App store, where revenue grew 35 yoy and Apple Music increased its paying subscriber base from 11 mn to 13 mn over the year. Apple Pay also increased its transactions volume by 5x."
587,21,Other Products revenue increased. Apple Watch sales helped to pull up the Other Products category by 30 yoy.
588,21,"Hardware sales continue weakening. iPhone unit sales were down 16 yoy, iPad and Mac unit sales were also down by 19 and 12 yoy, respectively."
589,21,"Initiating coverage with Buy rating AAPL has had impressive 840 growth rate over the past 10 years, with iPhone as its main growth driver. Despite recent weakness, AAPL is still generating enormous profits and cash. AAPL generated more than US50 bn in revenue and more than US10 bn in net income during a difficult quarter. Additionally, its expansion in Services segment could provide support to its future growth. Services has been increasing at an incredible rate, averaging about 20 growth over 5 years, and as AAPL expands its services, users would become more entrenched into its ecosystem."
590,21,"We are Positive on the Companys long term prospects, supported by its robust established user base and strong balance sheet. Nonetheless, much would still hinges on the Companys ability to innovate and contribution from its new products."
591,21,We have a DCF valuation of US119.37 for AAPL .
592,21,"iPhone sales are the main revenue source for AAPL and accounts for 65 of AAPLs total revenue. As such, AAPL is known primarily as a hardware company, selling iPhones. The Company has taken steps to diversify its revenue streams. While these steps do show promise, but at this point in time, the impact on total revenue is negligible compared to the revenue from the iPhone."
593,21,"iPhone had a phenomenal year in FY2015, which saw accelerated upgrade rate leading to close to 40 yoy sales growth. Unit sales have increased at an impressive CAGR of 17 yoy over the past 4 years."
594,21,"However, with the poor showing in its latest quarter results, coupled with near term macro headwinds and market saturation, it is likely that iPhone sales for the remaining of 2016 could be flattish, and this year could be the first year that AAPL will report a decline in unit sales."
595,21,"That said, AAPL mentioned several mitigating factors that could underpin iPhone Sales Upgrades. The first half of the upgrade cycle for iPhone 6s has seen a slightly higher rate than the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago. It cited a Kantar survey showing a 95 iPhone loyalty rate. Furthermore, according to Kantar, the iPhone 6 and 6 plus accounted only for 24 of all iPhones being used in US and China US and China iPhone users account for 65 of its total user base. Coupled with iPhones 6s sales, that represents a sizable portion of current iPhone users that have yet to upgrade to the 6 or 6s, which AAPL could tap on when the next iteration is introduced. This was also mentioned previously by Tim Cook, with 60 of current iPhone users have yet to upgrade."
596,21,Switchers. AAPL mentioned that there were more switchers from Android or other platforms to iOS in the 1HFY16 compared to any other sixmonth period ever.
597,21,"First timer. AAPL mentioned that India could be the next growth driver and market for iPhones, citing iPhone sales in India were up 56 yoy. While global smartphone market seems to have reached saturation point in developed nations, Indias LTE network is still rolling out, representing a large untapped market. First timers are crucial to the Companys long term growth. Each new user is a potential loyal AAPL user. Once the user becomes entrenched into its Ecosystem, the user could start engaging in its Services and purchasing other AAPL products."
598,21,"iPhone SE, released on 31 March was not included in 2QFY16s results. AAPL cites that demand for iPhone SE has exceeded its expected supply, leading also to the depressed 3QFY16 profit guidance. Should sales for the iPhone SE take off, it would be indicative of pent up demand for cheaper iPhones and an opportunity for AAPL to create further headway into developing markets."
599,21,"Should AAPL follow its previous release schedules and release the iPhone 7 around September end FY16, it could also entice the large pool of older iPhone users to upgrade as the iPhone 5 and 5s would be 2 product cycles old by then. However, the new iPhone 7 could only start contributing to its bottom line in FY17."
600,21,"Given these factors, we believe that while iPhones will face headwinds in the increasingly saturated developed nations smartphone market, the fears of peak iPhone are"
601,21,"overblown and believe that there is potential for iPhone sales to grow in the future, albeit at a slower rate."
602,21,"AAPLs tablet offering the iPad, used to account for about 18 of AAPLs total revenue. However, the rapid growth of iPhones and falling iPad sales has led to iPad now making up only 10 of AAPLs total revenue."
603,21,"Tablets have longer replacement cycles compared to smartphones as consumers are less compelled to upgrade their tablets compared to smartphones. In 2QFY16, AAPL reported iPad sales were down 19 yoy with unit sales of 10.25 mn. iPad sales were slightly better than consensus estimates which were on average about 9.95 mn. Of note however, the new 9.7 inch iPad Pro was only released at the end of Q2 2016 and sales figures would not have captured the full extent of demand. AAPL expects the next quarter to be the best iPad quarter in two years based on their estimates. For now, we expect the iPad to continue accounting for a smaller component of AAPLs revenue over time."
604,21,"Macs are AAPLs laptops offering, they account for 11 of AAPLs revenue. Mac unit sales have been on the uptrend over the past 3 years as the Macbook has gained popularity and more mainstream acceptance. However, Macbook sales fell 9 yoy in 2QFY16, which was worse than consensus estimates. However, a silver lining is that AAPL is gaining traction in China, where 80 of the Chinese Mac buyers were purchasing for the first time. Management has given guidance that it expects Mac sales to increase in 3QFY16 on the back of an updated Macbook, which was thinner and lighter with better specs. As one of AAPL core offerings, we expect Mac sales to maintain its share of revenue as it gains traction as a viable alternative to PCs. We believe that Mac sales will increase as compared to the iPad, despite both having similarly long replacement cycles compared to iPhone due to Mac having greater functionality."
605,21,"Apple Watch led to a 30 yoy growth in Other Product revenue, since it is a relatively new product offering, the Watch has generated new avenues of revenue for AAPL. Whether the take up rate can continue or the Watch becoming like the iPad in terms of replacement rate remains to be seen."
606,21,"Revenue from Services rose 20 yoy to US6 bn in 2QFY16. Apple as a service is a concept that AAPL has taken large steps towards and is increasingly becoming the bright spot in the current environment of stalling hardware sales. Services create the Eco system which allows AAPL to further entrench its user base, creating more reasons for its stickability. AAPL has been showing that it is increasingly able to monetize that active user base to generate more revenue from its services. In the 1QFY16, AAPL revealed that it had 1 bn active installed base, devices that were actively engaged in Services within that quarter, leading to Installed Base Related Purchases of US8.9 bn. This figure grew by 27 yoy to US9.9 bn in the March quarter."
607,21,"App Store. Revenue grew by 35 yoy, generating 90 more global revenue than Google Play."
608,21,"Apple Music. Music grew from 10 mn to 13 mn paying subscribers since introducing a download and streaming model, leading AAPL to be optimistic that Apple Music revenue will start growing again moving forward."
609,21,"Apple Pay. Being very new, Apple Pay is not expected to make significant contribution to AAPLs FY16 revenue. However, adoption rate is increasing exponentially, with transactions volume growing by 500 yoy. AAPL has launched over 2.5 mn locations that accept Apple Pay, with plans to expand further. While usage rates remain low, as the idea of NFC Near Field Communication payment is still new and not widely adopted yet, there is still much room for growth and eventually monetization. However, with credit card companies like Visa, as well as other phone companies like Samsung, are also heading into the space, the idea of NFC payments might not take that long to be legitimized. As such, we view this as an avenue with great potential in the future."
610,21,"Overall, we see great potential in Apple as a service. It remains the one category of revenue that AAPL has been able to achieve consecutive doubledigit growth, on average about 20, over the past 5 years. Services provide recurring revenue stream for AAPL that could grow independent of the unit sales, making it especially helpful in the current environment of slowing hardware sales. We expect Services revenue to continue to grow and become a greater part of AAPLs revenue as upgrade cycles for iPhones stretch to 23 years."
611,21,"Of note though, is Chinas recent ban of AAPL iBooks and iTunes Movies, which could be a potentially worrying trend. Considering that if Services are to be the future of AAPL and Chinas important role in this strategy, then it would be a huge detriment to AAPLs future growth if the ban expands to the rest of AAPLs services. For now however, with just the iBooks and iTunes Movies ban, while worrying, it is not a large dent in AAPLs services growth and the thesis of Service growth should still hold."
612,21,"AAPL main revenue source by region comes from Americas, which makes up 40 of the total revenue. While Americas contribution to AAPLs revenue has been increasing on an absolute value, it has not been growing at a very fast pace. Americas revenue grew 4 in 2014 when total revenue grew 7, and grew at 17 yoy in 2015 when total revenue grew at 28. It is likely that Americas revenue will continue to grow at a slower pace as compared to the total revenue."
613,21,"On the other hand, Greater China, which currently makes up 25 of its total revenue, has been rising at an incredibly fast pace. In 2014, Greater China only made up 17.4, this represents an 84 yoy increase. In the 2QFY16, China had a qoq change of 32 from 1QFY16, and a yoy change of 26. China was the main reason for AAPLs explosive growth in the previous year, growing by 84 yoy in FY15. In comparison, 2QFY16s results appears dismal, coming in at US12.5 bn vs previous years US16.8 bn. When seen against the backdrop of such a breakout year previously, it is not surprising that investors have reacted negatively to AAPLs performance this quarter in China. However, we feel that this is less of a slowdown and more of a normalization of AAPLs sales in China. AAPLs YTD revenue from China stands at roughly US30.8 bn, already almost as much as FY14, where revenue from China was US31.8 bn. As LTE network continues to expand in China and adoption increases, we expect Chinas demand for iPhones to continue to grow. However, whether China adopts the same replacement rate that Americas has had over the past years remains to be seen. Regardless, China should continue to be a growing source of revenue for AAPL."
614,21,"As mentioned earlier, India is also a developing market which could provide avenues of future growth for AAPL, sales having grown 56 yoy. As LTE networks continue to rollout, smartphones become more useable as compared to 2.5G or 3G networks, leading to increase demand. APAC ex Japan accounted only for US15 bn, being home to more developing nations, but as those nations continue to develop, AAPL should be able to take advantage of improvements in infrastructure to expand there."
615,21,"AAPL has amassed a large amount of cash, with US232.9 bn in cash and marketable securities as of 31 Mar 2016, up almost US20 bn yoy. However, 90 of this cash hoard is outside the USA. This is significant due to USA tax laws, which would cause AAPL to have to pay upwards of about US60 bn if it was to remit back to the USA. AAPL has thus taken advantage of the current low interest rate environment to take on more debt. AAPL issued another US15.5 bn in USD notes in the latest quarter, bringing its debt level to about US72 bn. This puts its current net cash position at about US160 bn, which is equivalent to about US30 per share. Most of the borrowings has been put to fund the Capital return program, mainly dividends and share buybacks."
616,21,"5. Attractive Capital Return Program Dividends and buyback increased . AAPL announced a further increase to its capital return program on 26 April 2016, increasing it to US250 bn from US200 bn in April 2015. The dividend was increased to US0.57 per share for shareholders on close of business 9 May 16, up c.10 from US0.52. Since AAPL started paying a dividend in 2012, it has increased the dividend each year consecutively, from US0.38 per share to US0.52, with a CAGR of about 8p.a. This represents a payout ratio of about 24, which is relatively low, indicating that there is still substantial room for future dividend growth. Share repurchase authorization was also increased from US140 bn to US175 bn."
617,21,Valuation Methodology Discounted Free Cash Flow Model DCF model was used to derive a valuation of AAPLs intrinsic value.
618,21,"We have made the following assumptions for the model Headwinds in iPhone sales leading to decline and slow growth over the next two years, after which iPhone sales should start growing at a slower rate iPad sales may pick up in the next FY but repeat the cycle of slow replacement, leading to flat revenue Increase in Mac take up as Macbooks gain traction and more mainstream acceptance as PC and laptop replacements Service Revenue will increase as AAPL expands their ecosystem and continues to increase the monetization of their user base"
619,21,"We initiate coverage for AAPL with a Buy rating with a target price of US119.37 , derived from our DCF estimates."
620,21,"Poor response to iPhone 7. While AAPLs customer base is very loyal, if iPhone 7 has a lacklustre showing and fails to excite that base, it could lead to even lower take up and a longer replacement cycle. Weaker consumer sentiment amidst slowdown in the global economy could also negatively impact the take up of iPhones."
621,21,"Slowdown in Services. Services have been growing at an incredible rate and been the one bright spot in the 2QFY16. AAPL transitioning into more of a Services company rather than a Hardware company also forms the basis for our estimates of future growth. If Services revenue slows down or if consumers fail to become entrenched into AAPLs ecosystem, it would adversely affect AAPL and our valuations."
622,21,"It is difficult to find a one to one comparison to AAPL in the US market, as while its peers do have some overlap with AAPL, there is also large differences between them. As such, we have chosen to show Google and Microsoft as peer comparisons. Google is relevant for the Android comparison and Microsoft is relevant for the Windows phone, PC and its recent move into a Service company as well."
623,21,"AAPL remains the largest of the three companies by market cap. Based on PER, it is also the more undervalued stock amongst the three, trading at about 10x PER while the other two trade at more than 30x PER."
624,21,"AAPL, at US92.79, is also trading near its 52 week low of US91.85. Based on the Historical PER chart below, it is also trading at near 8 year low valuations. At US92.79, AAPL is trading at 10.32x PER as compared to its 5year historical average of 13.7x PER."
625,21,"AAPL gave poor guidance for 3QFY16, citing continued macro headwinds sending AAPL shares tumbling down. We expect AAPLs share price to remain depressed in the short term, while the market reacts bearishly to AAPL prospects and fears on iPhones saturation."
626,21,"However, AAPLs balance sheet remains strong with net cash at almost US160 bn, which works out to almost US30 net cash per share. At current prices, that indicates a net price US60 per share, indicating a c.7x FY16e PER."
627,21,"Additionally, its brand equity and loyal consumer base allows AAPL to continue to generate large profits and cash flow even in difficult seasons. Its growing Services revenue is promising as it shows AAPL is making headway in their transition to a Services company."
628,21,"Therefore, we believe that the current knee jerk reaction in the market to AAPL is overblown, leading to AAPL being undervalued. As such, we initiate a Buy rating on AAPL with a Target Price of US119.37 , indicating about a 28 upside to the share excluding dividends."
629,22,"EPS of 3.12 vs. consensus of 2.82 Net interest income was strong, fees and costs were both in line and reserve build was a bit higher than expected. Results also included 0.24 of securities losses and a few modest other items summarized below. The updated guide on net interest income was better than expected, though on the earnings call mgmt also cautioned net II may decline in FY23 vs. the higher 4Q22 run rate."
630,22,"Guidance Mgmt noted that the current US economy, consumer and business remains healthy but there are fairly significant headwinds in the near future."
631,22,"Net interest income. Mgmt expects 4Q22 net interest income of 19b and FY22 of 66b. Excluding markets which is how JPM has guided so far this year, net II is expected to be 19b in 4Q and 61.5b in FY22. This compares to previous guidance of 58b and beat our expectations of 60b. Note that mgmt assumes essentially no markets related net II in 4Q. The 19b NII expected in 4Q implies a 76b exit rate vs. 68bplus previously ex markets."
632,22,Mgmt noted that it will reach its target CET1 of 13 by 1Q23 and expects to resume buybacks which are currently suspended in early 2023.
633,22,"Lumpy items in the quarter Results included the following drags 959m of securities losses, 808m in LLR build, we estimate about 300m of equity investment losses, 47m of legal and 31m of CVA losses. There were modest gains of 54m related to MSR hedges. 19 tax rate was a touch below expected."
634,22,"Key trends Net interest income was strong, up more than 2b qq driven by solid loan growth of 2 on average vs. 2Q. Periodend loans rose 1, securities dropped 7 and deposits were down 3 with a 4 drop in US non interest bearing. Net interest income ex markets was 16.9b vs. 13.7b in 2Q."

636,22,Fee income declined 8 yoy. Trading increased 8 yoy vs. guidance of 5. FICC increased 22 vs. the year ago period driven by strength in macro and partially offset by weaker securitized products. Equities declined 11 vs. the strong year ago period.
637,22,"Firmwide IB fees declined 49 vs. the year ago period and was in line with guidance. ECM declined 72, DCM 40 and Advisory 31."
638,22,"Other fees like card were a bit weaker, mortgage was higher and fee income in the Commercial Bank was lower likely on weaker IB fees."
639,22,"Credit remained strong. Nonperforming assets declined 8 vs. 630, chargeoffs rose a modest 11 off low 2Q levels and 30 day card delinquencies increased 18bps vs. 630 and up 23bps yoy. As noted above, JPM added 808m to loan loss reserves."
640,22,"CET1 was 12.5, up 30bps vs. 2Q as earnings and RWA mitigation more than offset dividend payouts and AOCI hits 22bps. RWAs declined 23b qq. Mgmt noted being on track to hit 12.5 for 4Q22 and 13.0 for 1Q23. Mgmt expects to resume buybacks which are currently suspended in early 2023."
641,22,SLR remained unchanged at 5.3. JPM noted it called about 5.4b of preferreds and issued 3.5b of sub debt as SLR is less of a constraint than CET1.
642,22,Recent research 3Q Preview Are Stocks Set Up For Another Bear Market Rally?
643,23,"Amazon reported mixed 2Q17 results with revenue above and operating income below expectations. While the miss on operating income is Internet Digital Media disappointing, we believe this creates a buying opportunity. We believe the companys underlying fundamentals remained intact with continued strong demand for Prime, FBA, and AWS. Both 1P and 3P revenue, as well as total paid units accelerated during the quarter, driven by continued momentum in Prime membership as retail subscription revenue accelerated. We believe FBA program continued to gain traction both domestically and internationally. AWS continued to grow over 40 yy. We believe the companys ongoing heavy investments in fulfillment capacity, video content, and AWS are to match with its substantial growth rates, and should not be viewed negatively."
644,23,"Amazon reported 2Q17 revenue of 38.0B, representing 25 yy growth or 26 yy exFX, above consensus of 37.2B. N. America revenue was 22.4B, above consensus of 21.7B, representing growth of 27 yy exFX, an acceleration from 23 exFX in 1Q17. International revenue was 11.5B, up 22 yy exFX, inline with consensus. AWS continued to ramp with revenue growing 42 yy to 4.1B in Q2, also inline with consensus. Overall, we estimate Q2 GMV to be 79.7B, increasing 30 yy. GAAP operating income was 628M in 2Q17, below consensus of 1.1B, primarily driven by stepup in investments in fulfillment, video content, and AWS infrastructure, as well as increased sales force related to AWS and Advertising."
645,23,"In terms of revenue mix, retail subscription revenue totaled 2.2B, up 53 yy exFX, indicating continued growth momentum in Prime membership. According to latest estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners CIRP, U.S. Prime members reached 85M in 2Q17 and 28 of U.S. Prime members are monthly subscribers. We estimate global Prime members to be over 100M, taking into account monthly subscribers and lower international pricing."
646,23,"In Q2, thirdparty 3P retail revenue continued to outpace growth of firstparty Stock Price Performance 1P revenue, up 40 yy exFX, compared to 18 yy exFX for 1P. Both 1P and 3P revenue accelerated qq with particular strength in U.S. 3P units grew 32 yy and 3P units now represents 51 of total paid units, up from 49 in 2Q16. We believe FBA program continued to gain traction both domestically and internationally. Management mentioned that Amazon fulfilled units increased nearly 40 yy while fulfillment center square footage increased by 30 yy. We believe company should continue increasing its fulfillment capacity to match with its FBA demand and expect ongoing heavy investment in Q3 ahead of the holiday season."
647,23,"Our price target of 1,150 is based on the sumoftheparts analysis, which evaluates North America and International segments using EVRevenue multiple, and AWS segment using EVEBITDA multiple. Our price target is also below 7.9x FY18 Sales multiple of its largecap peers. Risks to Target"
648,23,"Risks to attaining our share price target include, but are not limited to 1 a decline in discretionary consumer spending, 2 slow adoption of Prime membership internationally, 3 increased ecommerce competition both domestically and internationally, 4 slowdown of revenue and operating margin growth of AWS due to competition and continued pricing cuts, 5 lack of traction in new products, such as groceries and home services, and 6 potential regulatory changes and uncertainties particularly in international markets."

999,26,"PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART The smartphone market, could converge to the growth rate, of the phone market."
1000,26,"Apple reported upside September quarter results that were once again driven by strong performance in iPhone sales, partially offset by a continued decline in sales of the iPad. The company reported iPhone unit sales of 39.3 million, growth of 21.8 on a revenue basis and 16.2 on a unit basis. We mention the unit growth remains materially below the IDC industry growth rate of 25.3. Given that Apple is generating the majority of its revenue and profits from sales of the iPhone, we mention a few statistics taken from IDC data"
1001,26,1 The total growth of the mobile phone market feature and smart phones was 4.8 in 2013 1.82 billion units.
1002,26,"2 Smartphones have passed over 50 of mobile phone shipments, representing 55.1 of total in 2013."
1003,26,"3 The smartphone market itself is slowing, from 46.6 in 2012, to 38.5 in 2013, the to 25 rate in the June quarter of 2014."
1004,26,"4 Android took 84.7 market share in the June quarter, with iOS at 11.7 and we do not expect the iPhone 6 to materially change this dynamic."
1005,26,5 Apple was able to increase its ASP to 605 in the September quarter. This compares to 58.6 of the Android shipments in the June quarter costing less than 200 off contract. Apple commands a price more than double the average selling price of the broader market.
1006,26,"We mention these points to highlight that Apples current dependence on iPhone hardware sales may be a looming headwind. The market dynamics for smartphone growth is slowing and may converge to the 5 growth rates of the overall mobile phone market. For us to turn more positive on Apple shares we prefer to see a stronger recurring revenue stream with a monthly component coming from streaming music and movie, payments and advertising. We understand the company is positioning for these markets, and it remains to be seen if Apple can build up a robust service layer before the smartphone product cycle elongates."
1007,26,Apple reported September quarter revenue of 42.1B. Revenue grew 12.4 YoY. Revenue for the FY 2014 was 182 B 7 YoY International sales accounted for 61.4 of total revenue in the September quarter and 64.3 for the full year. Apple returned over 19B to its shareholders in the September quarter.
1008,26,"iPhone The company sold 39.2M 12 YoY units in the September quarter. Macintosh Apple sold 5.5M 25 YoY Macs during the quarter. iPad Unit sales and revenue declined for the third consecutive quarter. iPad revenue was the 5 worst level of the 18 quarters the product has been in existence, with the only quarters being lower the initial four quarters at launch. There are now over 50 models of the Company Data iPad compared to just a handful at launch. Unit sales of 12.3 million were the lowest in 10 quarters, and a warning signal to what the future could hold for the smartphone market. Company guidance for the fiscal 2015 first quarter is 63.566.5B in revenue, gross margin of 37.538.5, tax rate to be 26.5, and operating expense of 5.45.5B. Balance Sheet AAPL has 155.2B in cash 25.99 share and 28.9B longterm debt as of September 27, 2014 The company generated 13.3B in cash from operations."
1009,26,"We increase our FY14 and FY15 estimates, maintain our HOLD rating on shares of Apple Inc. Our price target goes to 103 from 98, but we mention the majority of the nearterm good news in the current cycle is already known."

1017,28,Our new EPS estimate implies 8 EPS growth in Calendar 2019 thanks to expected share repurchase of 500 million shares this year.
1018,28,Estimated a 12.5 million miss on iPhones sold in December quarter primarily from China. Thats an 18 yy decline.
1019,28,"Cut iPhone revenue estimate by 25 billion for Fiscal 2019, which takes total revenue growth to 0.0."
1020,28,"We cut our Fiscal 2019 EPS estimates by 1.30 to 12.34 following Apples pre announcement earlier this afternoon. Our new estimates imply 4 EPS growth in Fiscal 2019 despite an expected 5 decline in Net Income, thanks to the share repurchase program."
1021,28,25 billion iPhone revenue cut to our Fiscal 2019 iPhone revenue estimate based on a 31.5 million 14 cut to our estimate of iPhone units sold. Our estimates now imply a 12 decline in iPhone revenue and 15 decline in units sold in Fiscal 2019.
1022,28,"12.5 million miss on iPhones sold in December quarter We estimate iPhone units sales were less than 64 million in the December quarter, an 18 decline from last year. Thats the largest decline in unit sales since the March 2016 quarter following the launch of the iPhone 6S when unit sales declined 16. We expect iPhone unit sales to drop to 42.5 million in the March quarter, reflecting typical seasonal declines and implying a 19 decline from the prior year. This is clearly an important metric and one that Apple said they would no longer report when they issued guidance 63 days ago. It is not helpful to investors to not report this metric."
1023,28,"Subsidies? CEO Tim Cook primarily cited a weakening economy in China as the reason for the revenue shortfall and the environment sounds very bad there and obviously not being helped by the ongoing trade war or the rising prices of Apples products. Cook also noted the lack of subsidies by wireless operators in developed markets. That is not a new trend. On CNBC, Cook suggested that tradeins offered by Apple can act as an effective subsidy, but operators have been offering tradein promotions for years, albeit at lower levels in the past two years. Link There has not been evidence of an incremental acceleration in the decline in upgrade rates in the United States or other developed markets. The replacement cycle might not be rebounding, but its very hard to believe that a further lengthening in the product cycle is a material contributor to the miss reported this afternoon."
1024,28,"0.0 revenue growth is our new expectation for Fiscal 2019, but we believe Apple can return to revenue growth in the June quarter. Too bad they wont report that for more than six months."
1025,28,"19 growth in everything else. The huge miss in iPhone was offset by upside to other segments. In aggregate, Apples other product segments genera ted 1.75 billion 6 of upside to our estimate. We estimate that the upside was generated from wearables, services and iPads as detailed in the tables below. We adjusted our forward estimates in these segments accordingly."
1026,28,Gross margin of 38 was at the low end of the guided range and reflected some contraction from last year. We cut our future gross margin estimates by 50 basis points. Guidance on this line item given the lower revenue expectations will be critical.
1027,28,"500 million shares could be bought. We are maintaining our expectation that Apple will buy back 20 billion of stock each quarter, but have adjusted the share repurchase price based on the move in the stock. As a result, we now expect Apple to buy back 503 million shares in calendar 2019, which represents 11 of the FQ1 share count of 4.77 billion shares."
1028,28,We cut our price target to 197 from 235 million based on our 15.0x was 16.5x our new calendar 2019 EPS estimate of 13.12 was 14.25. The SP 500 trades at a 14.4x multiple of expected consensus EPS from FactSet. Our target also implies a free cash flow yield of 7.3 was 6.5.

1157,30,"Yesterday, we increased our price target for JPM and today the CFOs upbeat presentation Mike Mayo, CFA reinforced our condence. First, capital markets are stronger for longer in 1Q21, including meaningfully higher trading YTD and much higher IB both YoY and equities Christopher Spahr leading. Second, credit is trending better than expected, which supports the possibility of additional reserve releases. Credit card volumes, while still depressed from greater than expected paydowns, are showing early green shoots and should improve later this Robert Rutschow year. As it relates to costs, JPM reiterated that costs are impacted by a stepup in extra investments 1.5bn nontech 0.9bn tech and revenuedriven comp. The main negative is that its GSIB bucket is now likely 4 vs. 3.5 but this does not matter in our earnings Eric Chan model given the degree of capital already on their balance sheet and cautious nearterm loan growth outlook."

During this period of covid, playing defense has carried more importance, but greater oense is expected to play a role as JPM continues to invest longterm.

1169,32,"JPMs strong 3Q20 beat reflects our Goliath is Winning theme given superior growth, efficiency, and ROTCE 19. Thats given YoY capital markets strength up 14th, deposit growth equal to the 8 largest bank, and matching revenues and expenses despite a 14th decline in NIM. Given a lack of reserve builds, it also reflects our theme that credit has improved as reflected by 25tn of fixed income assets see our note from last week, meaning that 2Q20 marked a low point for EPS. Indeed, we increased ests. due to better than expected credit see below. Otherwise, the earnings call implied a flattening out of NII from this point and enough reserves to handle a severe stress test scenario. The big industry questions are the extent that problems are delayed vs. resolved. For example, credit is mixed NPAs up 18 QoQ but JPM doesnt expect meaningful NCO increases until 2H21, loan growth will likely stay subdued down 2 QoQ given paydowns, and the extent that capital markets are a pull forward guided flattish investment banking in 4Q20."
1170,32,"Increasing estimates. We are increasing 2020 EPS from 6.00 to 7.15 largely reflecting 3Q20 results, but also higher 4Q20 EPS due to materially lower NCOs than previously modeled as well as continued momentum in investment banking and mortgage production. We also increased our 2021 EPS from 7.75 to 8.35 largely due to lower est. net chargeoffs, which arent expected to materially increase until 2H21, partially offset by lower NII."

Credit provisions were materially lower than expected 0.6bn actual vs. 2bn in our model due to lower NCOs and reserve releases portfolio related instead of an expected modest reserve build.

1175,33,"Shares of Apple are up as the company produced June quarter results ahead of low consensus and issued September quarter guidance ahead of expectations. While the stock is materially rallying on the results, the underlying metrics that drive our sell rating are in still intact. These include"
1176,33,"1 Revenue decline of 15 YoY in the June quarter and our expectation of a decline of 8 in the September quarter, even at the upper end of company guidance. 2 We estimate FY2016 revenue declines 8 and FY2017 revenue declines 1, and our bias remains to the downside. We see that it is more likely that the market for smartphones decelerates than accelerates. 3 September quarter guidance likely includes the benefit of building up channel inventory, which was decreased in the June quarter by 4 million units. 4 Channel inventory build may negatively impact December quarter results. 5 iPhone revenue declined for the second consecutive quarter, and we estimate that iPhone revenue to decline for the next 5 quarters on a year over year basis. 6 Average selling price for the iPhone dropped 10 YoY and 7 sequentially, driven by customer interest in lower priced iPhone SE, resulting in the lowest gross margins in 7 quarters. 7 Operating margin of 23.9 was the lowest in 7 years. 8 Greater China revenue declined 33 YoY and 29 sequentially, and even with adjustments for currency, we note the market declined in a quarter where the low cost iPhone SE was released. 9 Only two areas of the company produced revenue growth, iPad and Services. Services revenue, while touted by management, is only 14 of total. iPad revenue grew although units sold declined driven by higher ASPs. 10 Domestic cash is down to 7 of total, at 17 billion, a 29 sequential decline, limiting flexibility as the company returned 13 billion in the quarter, with a dividend commitment of 3.2 billion per quarter. Debt is 72 billion. 11 Shares keep making lower lows, and lower highs looking back to 2015, and remains precipitously subject to the consumer whim regarding the iPhone. 12 We give ourselves up to 9 months for the thesis to evolve and price target to be reached, after which we expect the iPhone 10 anniversary model to reset demand in the fall of 2017."
1177,33,"As we mentioned in our downgrade, with expectations for the June quarter low, and consensus at the midpoint of guidance, it was possible that shares rally. However, when we ask ourselves Do we see Apple gaining or losing its next 100 billion of Company Data value, the answer remains losing. The reason we picked 100 billion is to accommodate a rally such as today, and we still see that the dynamics of the next iPhone cycle is positioned to disappoint the market. The setup of stronger than expected guidance for the September quarter driven by our opinion of an inventory build reverses the dynamic of the June quarter where expectations were low."
1178,33,"AAPL has 232B in cash 42.30 share and 69B longterm debt as of June 25, 2016. We increase our FY16 estimates and adjust FY17 estimates, maintain our SELL rating and price target at 85 on shares of Apple Inc."

1183,33,"Economic conditions Uncertain global economic conditions may postpone consumer spending due to unemployment, tighter credit, negative financial news and decline in incomeasset values. This could adversely affect the performance and operations of the company."
1184,33,"Competition There is immense competition and rapid technological changes take place in the global market for mobile communication devices, personal computers, digital music and video devices and related services. AAPLs operating results could be affected badly in case it is not able to compete in such adverse market conditions."

1188,34,APPLE EARNINGS PREVIEW DOWNGRADE TO HOLD AS SHARES HIT PRICE TARGET.
1189,34,"PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART The risks seem balanced, to the upside and downside, with good news priced in."
1190,34,"Shares of Apple have produced a total return dividends reinvested of 42.5 since our upgrade on April 22, 2013 compared to a total return of the SP500 index of 16.4 dividends reinvested. We are reducing our rating to HOLD from BUY as the stock has reached our 550 price target and we expect the performance of the stock to track more in line with the broader market index."
1191,34,"We expect Apple to post an astounding quarter with over 80 million iOS units sold, powered by the view that the company makes the best products in the space. That said, we see that the market has already broadly anticipated a record quarter, and the upside risks seem balanced with downside risks in our view. Yes, we could be giving away some upside on the reaction to the December quarter print, particularly if the company can ship 5760 million iPhones or produce results with revenue and EPS around 60 billion and 15. That said, we see that expectations are again possibly overheating, particularly with regard to the opportunity with China Mobile. Additionally the market dynamic where the functionality gap between products is closing, while the price gap is widening remains an issue for Apple. Broadly speaking, the next 1 billion people purchasing smartphones are going to be from demographics less wealthy than the first billion, and the skew towards lower priced hardware is likely to continue. We do not suggest that Apple, as a highend brand, needs to chase after the lowend market, but we do suggest that the company introduce new products to its customer base."
1192,34,"We remain positive on Apples ability to introduce wearable products that target the quantified self, a market we see as a natural fit to the Apple customer base. We are also positive on the potential for beacons and payments. We appreciate the concept of ultrahigh definition TVs, and the streaming potential for associated content from iTunes, but caution this type of product may capture less than the 10 market share suggested by certain investors in a recent SEC filing."
1193,34,"It is also worth mentioning that one can argue that Apple is lagging in critical areas, with high profile wearable products from competitors already on the market such as Glass, inexpensive products such as Chromecast linking tabletsphonesPCs to TVs, and Apples approximately 575 million credit cards associated with iTunes an underutilized asset as it is not being broadly used for other payments."
1194,34,"Valuation. While we appreciate that Apples shares may look appealing from a ratio perspective, trading at 12.3x our FY2014 earnings estimate, we mention again that Company Data earnings of companies in a fast moving technology landscape can change quickly. Apple remains that largest capitalized company on a U.S. listed exchange with its 493B valuation and as such we see the company as also being subject to selling for reasons outside of its fundamentals such as cash liquidation needs."

1204,35,"PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Haiku The stock is trading, as if investor patience, has come to an end."
1205,35,"Amazon reported March quarter results in line with expectations, and provided a June quarter outlook with respectable revenue guidance but disappointing operating income. The stock has traded down 9 on the results, building on the recent downward trend that has Amazons stock approximately 100 below its alltime high on January 22, 2014. The quarter provided metrics that support both the positive and negative views on the company. On the positive side, the company reaccelerated revenue growth to 23 YoY, and issued June quarter guidance that could show revenue growth up to 26 YoY. Countering the top line growth are the following negatives"
1206,35,"1 The company remains in a constant investment cycle and forecast that June quarter operating income should result in a loss. 2 Shipping losses as a percent of revenue grew to 5, and the company spent 2.15 on shipping cost for every dollar in shipping revenue. With a shipping loss of 980 million in the quarter, the recently announced prime price increase is only going to be small offset. We expect the company to push deeper into delivery logistics, and while this may allow same day delivery, it is likely to represent another major investment initiative. 3 Revenue per employee continues to drop, declining 10 YoY and 38 sequentially. 4 While revenue growth picked up, unit growth remained flat at 25. 5 The Technology Content expense line grew 44 YoY, materially faster than revenue. 6 Media growth of 8 YoY shows the disruption Amazon faces as content becomes digitized and shifts to subscription formats. International media growth is anemic at 4 YoY. The company now sells more digital media units than physical media units in North America."
1207,35,"Amazon reported March quarter revenue of 19.7B in line with our estimate of 19.6B and consensus estimate of 19.4B, which accounted for 22.8 YoY growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share of 0.23 was in line with consensus of 0.23. Operating income was 146M in Q114."
1208,35,Guidance The companys June guidance for GAAP operating loss is a range from a loss of 455M to 55M. Revenue guidance is net sales between 18.1B and 19.8B 15 to 26.
1209,35,"North America North America segment reported revenue of 11.8B in the first quarter for 60 of total, 26.3 YoY growth and segment operating income of 562M. Segment operating margin was 4.7 down from 4.9 in the prior year. Media growth in North America was 12.4 YoY for 23.8 of North American revenue and EGM electronics and other general merchandise revenue grew 27.8 YoY to account for 66 of North American revenue."
1210,35,"International International segment reported revenue of 7.8B in the first quarter with 18 YoY growth. Media revenue grew 3.8 YoY to provide 33.5 of total, and EGM grew 27 YoY to provide 65.8 of total. Company Data Media EGM Worldwide Media revenue grew 8 YoY to 5.4B and 27.7 of total. Electronics and Other General Merchandise EGM revenue grew 27.4 YoY to 13B. This segment is the growth engine for the company and now accounts for 66 of total revenue."
1211,35,"Shipping Losses Worldwide shipping costs were 5 of net revenue compared to 4.7 in the previous quarter and 4.7 in the first quarter of 2013. Shipping losses continue to be an issue for the company facing razor thin profitability,"
1212,35,"Balance Sheet Amazon has 8.6B in cash 18.52 share and 3B longterm debt as of March 31, 2014. Cash flow from operations was negative at 2.5B in the March quarter. We adjust our FY14 and FY15 estimates and maintain our HOLD rating and our price target of 365 on shares of Amazon.com Inc."
1213,36,"PEP Q421 results included the best organic sales twoyear stack in at least a decade Chris Carey impressive, even if inclusive of signicant investment levels as PEP sets the tone for another year of abovealgorithm topline growth in 2022. Ultimately, sales strength gives Joe Lachky, CFA options, especially given no volume growth is factored in 2022. But, ination will weigh heavy. Our view here PEP has the tools to meet the outlook, and can adjust as the year progresses, but our base case for 2022 is that the outlook is reasonable, not conservative, Marc Torrente, CFA, CPA and requires signicant levels of pricing with productivity."
1214,36,"Our 2022e EPS is unchanged at 6.67, with organic Estimates and target unchanged. sales 6.6 was 6.7, gross margins 10bps was 30bps and op margins 20bps was 80bps, with our op prot 2 vs prior. The oset is tax, now modeled at 20 prior 21. Our 2023e EPS remains 7.15."
1215,36,"PEPs 6 organic sales outlook for 2022 is driven entirely A pricing driven year in 2022. by pricemix CFO Johnston noted PEP will probably be around 7 pricing. On one end, a year with no volume growth looks conservative in the context of recent momentum and with elasticities still low that in mind, the twoyear stack on volumes of 6 for 2021 on 2021 4, 2020 2 is historically strong best in a decade, and compares to 2yr stacks of 2.51.5122.5 in the 5 years prior. A return of mobility could dent the at home strength PEP has seen both in Food and Beverage albeit thats more conceptual at this point, and PEP has invested heavily into sustaining brand momentum into 2022. Nevertheless, a year of 7 pricing on top of a year with 5 pricing with historically dicult volume comps creates a bit of a balancing act momentum yes, but tough comps too so its hard to say if the volume call is conservative. We model 2022 organic sales 6.6 on pricemix 6.9 with volume 0.3."
1216,36,"Per PEPs 10K, Ination is building into 2022 thoughts on the commodity bridge. commodities were a 14pt hit to op prot in 2021. Some math Q123 disclosures were 5814 from commodities, which implies that Q4 was a 26 hit. For COGS, this would imply commodities in Q123421 were a negative 1.72.85.27.1 impact, i.e. an exit rate of over 7, and our sense is this is building into 2022 with a HSD potential impact to COGS just from commodities. Taking PEPs 7 pricing target 5.5bn, and assuming commodities a 9 hit to COGS 3.4bn, thatd imply an additional 2bn of wiggle room from the pricing. Wageslabor ination is at least MSD note roughly half of SGA is labor. If we assume all of SGA is 5, thatd be 1.5bn. Basically, that bridge leaves you about MSD op prot growth to drop to the bottomline. Productivity could drive upside should SGA accelerate beyond this level, leaving PEP some cushion to deliver, unless volumes come undone. An extra week is also a factor."
1217,36,"PEP has the tools to combat 2022 ination, So back to a core concept...stretch vs ex. given pricing power in the business but, nevertheless 7 pricing is a big number historically high, on an already historically high comp and needed to combat signicant ination. Basically, its just harder to make as strong an upside case for earnings."
1218,36,"In Q123422, we remove Rene model for Tropicana deal close. 310690940940mn in Tropicana sales 8020 NAEurope, while removing op prot of 37709090mn 9010 NAEurope. We apply deal proceeds to debt paydown. Latest net dilution is roughly 1213c to 2022 EPS per PEP, mitigated by the extra week."
1219,36,"Investment Thesis PEP results have been resilient amidst COVID and with a consistent algorithm and valuation in line with historicals, we expect the stock to track the group. We carry a positive lean and recognize the case that could drive earnings catalysts. We simply need time to assess if these scenarios become reality, namely PBNA, and view EPS expectations as reasonable for now, hence the Equal Weight rating. Target Price Valuation for PEP 175.00 from NC Our 175 price target is based on a 24.5x PE multiple to our CY23 EPS estimate. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for PEP Downside risks 1 PEP is global and the world faces many risks that could slow its category growth COVIDrelated for ex and thus, company revenueearnings 2 PBNA margins remaining stagnant would aect our EPS estimates that embed improvement. Upside risks 1 PBNA margins accelerating could drive upside to earnings, and 2 a faster global recovery, which would drive PEPs foodservice business."
1220,37,"PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Haiku The second quarter, of declining iPad sales, is an adverse trend."
1221,37,"Shares of Apple are trading up approximately 3 after June quarter earnings that accelerated the trends that materialized in the March quarter. iPhone unit sales slowed to 13, compared to the broader market that is likely growing over 25 YoY. Revenue from iPhone unit sales grew at an even slower pace at 10 YoY, as customers opted for older models at lower prices. Average selling price declined 35 sequentially and 76 from the December quarter. ASPs of 561 are still materially above the expected industry average of 314 in 2014 according to IDC. While Apple is currently enjoying success selling its old model phones into emerging markets, one has to question the long term viability as competition becomes more aggressive in the mid and entry markets, offering consumers current model phones at similar or lower price points, and with a willingness to capture less gross margin. The mix shift to the older model Apple phones resulted in gross margins of 39.4, above the company guidance of 3738, and 250 basis points above the prior year June quarter. We expect the favorable gross margin trends to reverse starting in the current quarter as the next generation iPhone should have a lower margin profile particularly if the phone has a sapphire screen."
1222,37,"iPad. The company saw its second consecutive quarter of decline in iPad units sold on a YoY basis. Unit sales at 13.3 million were approximately half of the December quarter unit sales. While investors have largely glossed over the decline in iPad revenue, we mention it is a distinct possibility that Apple may experience declines in iPhone unit sales after the next upgrade cycle, if consumers lengthen the life span for smartphones as core features such as LTE, fingerprint scanning, and larger screens have the potential to satiate the typical customer. Our estimates for the coming upgrade cycle include some larger numbers such as 59.5 million phones in the December quarter, a number that may be hard to eclipse in the December 2015 quarterly results."
1223,37,"Channel inventory. We estimate that iPhone channel inventory was kept near record levels at 15.25 million units, a small decline of 150k units from the March quarter. We also mention that while the company disclosed the change in channel inventory, it stopped providing the absolute number. For comparison, the company reduced channel inventory by 600K units in the prior year June quarter to 11 million units. The growth of channel inventory at 39 YoY meaningfully outpaces the unit sales volume of 10 YoY. Using 13 weeks in the quarter, and based on the 35.203 million units sold in the quarter a pace of 2.7 million units per week, we note that 15.25 million units in the channel represents approximately 5.5 weeks on inventory. We find it interesting that the company is maintaining channel inventory at the high end of its 46 week range given a product refresh is likely coming."
1224,37,Apple reported June quarter revenue of 37.4B. Revenue grew 6 YoY. International sales accounted for 59 of total revenue. Apple returned over 8B to its shareholders Company Data in the June quarter. iPhone The company sold 35.2M 12.7 YoY units in the June quarter. Macintosh Apple sold 4.4M 17.6 YoY Macs during the quarter.
1225,37,"Company guidance for the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter is 3740B in revenue, gross margin of 3738, tax rate to be 26.1, and operating expense of 4.754.85B."
1226,37,"Balance Sheet AAPL has 164.5B in cash 27.18 share and 29B longterm debt as of June 28, 2014. The company generated 10.2B in cash from operations.

1234,38,"Benefits of scale. JPM is acting more as an intermediary at a time when it is needed more i.e., it is reintermediating. JPM showed the benefit of size given profits despite 9bn of charges, flightto quality benefits wbalance sheet growth equal to the 6thlargest bank, best ever trading quarter up 13 YoY, and positive operating leverage exwritedowns on bridge loans and derivatives 2bn. Yet, JPM indicated that its large reserve builds in 1Q20 7bn could get repeated ahead given its worse economic forecasts. We lower our est. for 2020 6.30 to 4.60 but keep our 2021 est. 7.35 and price target 115 the same. We suspect that JPMs economic assumptions will be more conservative than most."
1235,38,"Crisis impacts. Results in 1Q20 did not reflect too much of the downturn as credit losses declined QoQ and the net interest margin was about flat. Looking ahead, JPM now has worse economic forecasts for 2Q20 GDP 40 vs. 25 and unemployment 20 vs. 10, which means that 2Q20 may be a kitchen sink quarter like 1Q20. Items to watch include mortgage forbearance 4 so far, decline in purchase volume for restaurant and TE down 50, and coml revolver utilization record 44. Periodend assets increased QoQ 2.7tn to 3.1tn, wlarge increases in CIB 33, the coml bank 12, and for March up 100bn. Also, debt underwriting and trading were at alltime records in 1Q20."
1236,38,"Balance sheet resiliency. We continue to view this as an income statement recession and not a balance sheet one for banks. Despite charges of 9bn, JPM still had decent capital CET1 ratio of 11.5 vs. 10.5 min., cash access to 1tn, and flattish book value. Reported EPS of 0.78 would equal 2.89 exreserve builds and almost 2bn of charges for bridge loans and derivatives. Trading was strong up 13 YoY, boding well for GS, trust banks, and other capital market players in 1Q20. Also, spreads have tightened since quarterend. The main issue was a 43 QoQ increase in NPAs some CECLrelated and reserve builds of 6.8bn cards and CECL a big component as JPM seeks to get ahead of upcoming credit losses."
1237,38,"Income statement mixed. Est. core efficiency improved to 55 vs. 56 QoQ and YoY with slightly faster revenue than expense growth both QoQ 6 vs. 3 and YoY 4 vs. 3 and it lowered 2020 expenses guidance 67bn to 65bn now. This mitigates the new NII guidance 55.5bn vs. 57bn. However, there are now new fee headwinds asset management, NIR in trading, credit card purchasing volume down, lower card outstandings, more. The bottom line is that we expect 1H20 to reflect a kitchen sink period that, should it prove too conservative, will provide more earnings flexibility on the backend. This is vintage JPM and Jamie Dimon prepare for a difficult period with a degree of conservatism and have extra reserves if the outlook pans out better than expected."
1238,38,"Price Target 115 from NC We arrive at a price target of 115 based on the simple average of six valuation techniques PE, priceto book, discount dividend model, PEG ratio analysis and sum of the parts for both PE and PB. Macro downside risk factors include a slowdown in global economic activity, greaterthanexpected increases in unemployment and bankruptcies in the US and abroad, and adverse changes in US and foreign laws and regulations. Companyspecific downside risks include higherthanprojected credit losses especially in credit cards and home equity but also other consumer areas and commercial lending, market and interestrate risks which can affect JPMorgans businesses and portfolios in a variety of ways, especially MSRs and investment securities, and operational risks primarily associated with regulatory compliance across the firms domestic consumer and global wholesale businesses."
1239,38,"JPMorgan Chase JPM has excelled at both offense and defense over the past decade in which it has been gaining market share in all major business lines while optimizing its businesses, showing consistent earnings relative to other global banks and creating a fortress balance sheet as defined by its CEO. Decade to date, playing defense has carried more importance but greater offense is needed ahead. Despite the risk with a transition from optimization to growth, the result should be the greatest value creation in a decade. We expect JPMorgans 2020 ROTCE est. 18 to be the best in the firms history on a riskadjusted basis during a period of time its cost of capital is declining."
1240,38,"JPMorgan Chase is a leading global financial services firm with assets of 2.7tn and operations. The firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, and asset management."
1241,39,AMAZON EARNINGS PREVIEW LOOKING FOR THE CORE BUSINESS TO START TO DRIVE PROFITS
1242,39,"PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Shares of Amazon are down over 10 yeartodate after delivering an eye popping return in 2015 of over 117, driven in large part by the growth and profitability of its Amazon Web Services AWS cloud business. The company just started reporting the segment on a standalone basis in 2015. While the AWS business surprised with its profitability, we mention that the flip side is that the core retail business remains essentially unprofitable. This is expected to change when the company reports December quarter results on Thursday January 28 post market. With a market capitalization of 282 billion, our take is that the AWS business is priced in to stock. It is possible that risks to the margin of the AWS business may appear over time if services become commoditized. We see that the question of generating leverage from the core retail business is partially driven by controlling delivery costs, with net shipping costs estimated at 4.1 of net sales, and total shipping losses to exceed 1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. We expect sustained investments in devices, content, and logistics may temper the leverage in the core business. We also note that Amazon shares are volatile on earnings, moving a minimum of 6 over the last 7 quarters."
1243,39,"We estimate revenue for the December quarter to be 36B, which is growth of 22 YoY. Our earnings per share estimate of 1.71 compares to an earnings per share 0.45 in the prior year and earnings of 0.17 in the prior quarter and is above the consensus estimate of 1.63."
1244,39,"North America We expect revenue from the North America segment to be at 21B in the quarter for 60 of total, 23 YoY growth and segment operating income of 896M. We expect Media to grow in North America at 14 YoY for 19 of North American revenue and EGM electronics and other general merchandise revenue to grow at 25 YoY, accounting for 80 of North American revenue."
1245,39,"International We expect revenue from International segment to be 12B in the quarter with a growth of 12 YoY growth. We expect Media revenue to grow 1 YoY to provide 29 of total, and EGM to grow at 17 YoY providing 70 of International revenue."
1246,39,"AWS We expect revenue from companys Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business is expected to be 2.5B, for 7 of total revenue and growth of 81 YoY.

1257,41,"Amazon reports December quarter results on Thursday January 30 postmarket. We expect the company to post a revenue growth of 21.4 YoY, its slowest revenue growth in the last 12 quarters. We expect revenue growth in 2013 decelerates to 22.2 from 26.3 in 2012, and mildly declines again in 2014. While we are fan of stocks that produce growth and have a reasonable valuation GARP, and we can also understand the valuations paid for hyper growth companies that are nascent and chasing large markets, we see that Amazon is exhibiting slowing growth at a spectacular price valuation, a combination we coyly call GASP. Amazon has the 17 largest valuation of the SP500 index at 176 billion, which we mention as we see the upside is becoming more limited. The company has the largest PE ratio at 1,415x earnings for companies in the US with a market capitalization above 25 billion. The second company is Adobe at factor lower with a PE of 100.4x. However, Amazon is ranked 18 in revenue growth using the same criteria of US listed companies with capitalization of 25 billion or more. We see that the price investors are paying is expensive for the current level of revenue growth given the uncertainty around the degree of leverage that the company may be able to achieve. That said, we also understand the view that Amazon is going to be the next WalMart, the 8 largest company on a US listed exchange, and a company that is valued at a market cap 37 above Amazon. However it may take years for Amazon to grow into this valuation fully."
1258,41,"We estimate revenue for the December quarter to be 25.8B, which is growth of 21.4 YoY. Our revenue estimate compares to consensus estimates of 26B. Our EPS of 0.54 compares to 0.21 in the prior year and 0.09 in the prior quarter and is below consensus EPS of 0.67."
1259,41,"Metric estimates. We estimate North America net sales of 15.5B 27.2 YoY in the December quarter, which form 60 of revenue. North America segment operating margin is estimated at 3.2. We estimate International net sales of 10.3B 13.6 YoY in the December quarter, which form 40 of revenue. International segment operating margin is estimated at 0.5. Media revenue is estimated at 7.6B 16.8 YoY, 29.5 of revenue and EGM at 16.6B 19.8 YoY, 64.6 of revenue. The revenue per employee has been dropping for Amazon in the last few quarters. We estimate worldwide shipping revenue of 840M, worldwide net shipping costs of 1.18B 4.6 of worldwide net sales in Q413."
1260,41,Guidance The companys forward guidance for GAAP operating income or loss in Q4 2013 is a Company Data range from a loss of 500M to an income of 500M. Revenue guidance from the company is net sales between 23.5B and 26.5B 10 to 25. Stockbased compensation and amortization of intangible assets is expected to be 350M.
1261,41,"Shipping Losses Worldwide shipping costs were 4.7 of net revenue compared to 4.6 in the previous quarter and 4.6 in the third quarter of 2012. Shipping losses continue to be an issue for the company facing razor thin profitability, but it is a mild positive that losses have stabilized as percent of total revenue in the last two quarters."
1262,41,"Balance Sheet Amazon has 7.6B in cash 16.82 share and 3B longterm debt as of September 30, 2013. Cash flow from operations was 1.3B in the September quarter. We increase our FY13 estimates and change our target to 365 from 320 but maintain our HOLD rating."
1263,42,"Amazon posted strong Q1 results with revenue and 1,900.00 operating income upside. The revenue upside was driven primarily by Amazons triple threat of Thirdparty Sellers 3P, Subscription Services, and AWS. We expect this trifecta to power Amazons growth for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we expect AWS, 3P and Advertising growth to buoy Amazons operating income. Looking ahead, while profitability could experience some choppiness from quarter to quarter given Internet Digital Media the timing of investments, we expect consistent revenue growth across Amazons key business to continue to power its dominant position in both ecommerce and AWS. We reiterate BUY rating and raise our PT to 1,900."
1264,42,"Amazon keeps growth momentum high in early 2018 with total revenue and profitability above consensus. Total revenue was 51.0B, above consensus of 49.9B, with upside coming from 3P, Subscriptions, AWS, and Other. GAAP operating income was 1.9B, significantly above consensus of 1.0B, driven primarily by outperformance in N. America."
1265,42,"Online Stores aka 1P revenue increased 13 yy exFX to 29.9B. While solid growth, Online Stores revenue was modestly below consensus of 27.3B. Due to the adoption of a new accounting principle that shifted sales of apps and certain digital content to 3P from Online stores, which reduced growth and revenue. We expect consistent growth of Amazons 1P business in the highteens given its product breadth and investment in its privatelabel brands."
1266,42,"3P is a powerful engine that should drive growth for the foreseeable future. 3P revenue increased 39 yy exFX, reaching 9.3B in 1Q18. We estimate continued growth in 2Q18 of 35 yy. Given the net revenue recognition of 3P transaction, we expect the strong growth to contribute significantly to operating income growth."
1267,42,"Subscription Services increased 56 yy, rising to 3.1B on strength of Prime Memberships. The company recently highlighted that it had 100M Prime members. Stock Price Performance We estimate Amazon has over 125M Prime Members with 100M in the U.S. The impact of Prime is evidenced by the rapid growth in Subscription Services. Notably, Prime members typically spend 2x, shop more frequently, and stay engaged on the platform longer than nonPrime members. Amazon announced a price increase to 119 from 99, effective May 11th, which should serve as a revenue growth catalyst in 2H18. Notably, the company now recognizes Prime subscriptions equally over 12 months, which boosts revenue in the earlier quarters, instead of recognizing a larger portion of the deferred revenue in Q4."
1268,42,"Our price target of 1,900 is based on the sumoftheparts analysis, which evaluates North America and International segments using an EVRevenue multiple, and AWS segment using an EVEBITDA multiple. Risks to Target"
1269,42,"Risks to attaining our share price target include, but are not limited to 1 a decline in discretionary consumer spending, 2 slow adoption of Prime membership internationally, 3 increased ecommerce competition both domestically and internationally, 4 slowdown of revenue and operating margin growth of AWS due to competition and continued pricing cuts, 5 lack of traction in new products, such as groceries and home services, and 6 potential regulatory changes and uncertainties particularly in international markets."

1667,47,"APPLE EARNINGS PREVIEW FOCUS ON SELLING PRICE, MARGINS, IPADS, AND EXPECTATIONS."
1668,47,"PRICE PERFORMANCE CHART Haiku It is possible, the iPhone upgrade cycle, starts to lengthen out."
1669,47,"Shares of Apple reached a lifetime high of 103.30 on September 2, 2014, and have since declined modestly by 5.3, in line with the SP500 index which shrank by 5.7 over the same period when factoring dividends. Looking at Apples share performance chart over the last two years, we mention that the other time that Apple has traded above the 100 mark was in September 2012. This raises the question, is the company poised to break out to new life time highs, or could shares be negatively impacted by overheated expectations and a slowing market for iPads?"
1670,47,"While we remain concerned on the iPhones shrinking market share, which was just 11.7 worldwide in the June quarter according to IDC Android was 84.7, we are positive on the burgeoning service layer that the company is growing. This includes Apple Pay, iBeacons, and improvements to iAds in iOS8 that allows for retargeting consumers. While we still see iAd as a faltering business, the potential when connected with iBeacons and Apple Pay is impressive. We would like to see the company build a robust subscription streaming music Beats and video offering to complement its other products."
1671,47,"iPhone We expect the company reverses the rather steep recent decline in average selling price given the product refresh and the addition of the premium priced iPhone 6 to the product mix. We estimate 38.5M units sold at an ASP of 600 representing 56.7 of revenue. Unit volumes are growth of 13.9 YoY and 9.4 sequentially. While the iPhone is an impressive revenue and profit driver for the company, unit volume growth remains materially below the broader market which posted growth of 25.3 in the June quarter according to IDC. Our HOLD rating is driven in part by concern that the upgrade cycle for premium smartphones may elongate as the current iPhone provides the core needs for most users fast connection speeds, biometric identification, larger screens. Faster and thinner may prove to be a less compelling reason to upgrade going forward. In our view, we are already seeing an elongation in the iPad refresh cycle. We expect the upgrade cycle for phones could also be stretched out by carrier reluctance to continue to subsidize handsets. We are currently modeling 59.5 million iPhones in the December quarter with an ASP of 655. This represents unit growth of 17 above the prior record for the company. Apple remains particularly vulnerable to posting record smashing results but having the outcome viewed as a disappointment due to overheated expectations."
1672,47,"iWatch. We are adding in the Watch to our FY2015 estimates, with 18 million units at an ASP of 500. Given the watch is not available for sale, we expect this estimate could have a wide variance."
1673,47,"Our estimate of revenue for September quarter at 40.8B is growth of 8.8 YoY and 8.9 sequentially. Our revenue estimate is above the consensus revenue of 39.8B. Our EPS estimate of 1.37 compares to 1.18 in the prior year and 1.28 in the prior Company Data quarter, and is above consensus earnings estimates of 1.30."
1674,47,"iPad We estimate 12.1M units sold at an ASP of 440 for 13.1 of total revenue. Unit volumes are decline of 14.1 YoY and decline of 8.9 sequentially. iPod We are modeling 2.7M units at an ASP of 160. Macintosh We expect 4.7M units sold in the quarter at as ASP of 1300 for 15 of revenue. Gross margin estimate is 38.1 Company guidance for the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter is 3740B in revenue, gross margin of 3738, tax rate to be 26.1."

1786,50,"We are initiating on Apple AAPL with an Overweight rating and December 2019 price target of 272, implying 23 upside from current levels. While Apples leadership position in the premium smartphone market is well understood by investors, we still see considerable upside to the stock from current levels led by a combination of 1 fasterthanexpected transformation to a services business 2 strongerthan expected priceincreases in the core iPhone business 3 underappreciated position for continued robust growth in the installed base 4 continuous innovation disrupting new endmarkets 5 boost to earnings growth from a normal courseof sharerepurchases and 6 optionality available from theuse ofa strong balance sheet for either outsized sharerepurchases or MA."
1787,50,"Fasterthanexpected transformation to Services. The mix of Services revenue rose from 8 in FY12 to 13 in FY17, and is forecast to furtherincrease to 20 by FY21E. We believe the transformation to services, led by growth in both installed devices and service revenue per device, is tracking better thaninvestor expectation, including achieving revenue target of 48bnby FY20E ahead of schedule."
1788,50,"Growth in installed base underappreciated. While investors have been overly concerned about the modest growth in device sales JPMe FY1721E CAGR of 1, we believe the robust highsingledigitgrowth in the installed base, which is a key contributor to Services revenuegrowth,has been underappreciated."
1789,50,"Capital deployment provides option value to investors. Apple has a target to be net cash neutral longterm and the availability to deploy up to 291mn cash on hand free cash flow by FY21E or 30 of the market cap through a combination of dividends, share repurchases, and MA provides enormous option value to investors in terms of potential upside to earnings."
1790,50,"MA opportunitiesto prioritize large installed base. Apples interest in entering new endmarkets is likely to be evaluated based on the opportunity to offer services on a large installed base. Certain endmarkets in our view could be of interest, including gaming services, automotive services,and smart speakers."
1791,50,"Initiate at OW with Dec19 price target 272, implying 23 upside. We base our valuation on a blended target PE multiple of 17.5x, led by a SOTP approach, which leads us to arrive at our Dec19 price targetof 272."
1792,52,Apples quarter was fine overall and FQ1 2016 guidance implies EPS 212 5273523 growth even at the low end of the range.
1793,52,"There is no change to our 10 Fiscal 2016 EPS estimate, which reflects 8 EPS growth and is above consensus."
1794,52,"We maintained our estimate of 80 million iPhone units sold in the December quarter, but took down our March estimate to 62.5 million 12 month target units from 66 million."

1796,52,52 week range Valuation Our 160 price target is based on 16x our F2016 EPS estimate of 10. Market Cap m
1797,52,"Apples guidance for the December quarter indicates growth in revenue and EPS, even at the low end of the range. That growth might be low singledigits, but its growth nonetheless for a stock that is discounting a fear of revenue and EPS declines. CEO Tim Cook also indicated that iPhone units would grow, which should be welcome news to investors after recent soft commentary from US wireless operators about upgrade rates."
1798,52,"While there are plenty of adjustments within our financial model, we continue to expect Apple to generate 10 in EPS in Fiscal 2016, reflecting 8 EPS growth, thanks to the continued aggressive share repurchase. This may be a slowdown from the 43 growth in Fiscal 2015, but we believe it should be enough to deserve a 16.0x PE multiple and 160 price target for Apple, given the strong free cash flow conversion."
1799,52,"Over the past week, the commentary from US operators about declining phone upgrade rates was starting to concern us, but apparently China continues to chug along unabated, with mainland units growing 120 during the quarter. As we learn more about phone upgrade programs, we agree with managements assessment that the benefit might actually be larger in future years than what they are seeing now. We also think there is an opportunity for Apple to expand its own upgrade program internationally, which could further accelerate replacement rates."
1800,52,"We maintained our estimate of 80 million iPhone units sold in the December quarter, recognizing that the US might not be as strong as we first thought. We took down our March estimate to 62.5 million units from 66 million in recognition of the potential impact of launching the iPhone into 50 markets earlier than we expected. Our new estimate reflects 2.2 unit growth in the March quarter and 5 growth for the year. We maintain our estimate of 4 ASP erosion in Fiscal 2016 as it seems implausible that Apple can continue the 5 consecutive quarters of annual iPhone ASP growth. The net impact is for slight growth in revenue for iPhones in 2016."
1801,52,"iPads continue to disappoint, declining yy for the seventh consecutive quarter. However, the ASP outlook is improved based on the current quarters results and the launch of the iPad Pro. As a result, our estimate for a decline in iPad revenue was cut in half to 5 from 10 in Fiscal 2016."
1802,52,"There are several factors that have led us to increase our services revenue by 1.7 billion for Fiscal 2016. The proliferation of Apple products globally from new and used purchases is leveraging the launch of Apple Music and obvious traction in Apple Pay, which got an added boost from a new deal with American Express for international use. Our new expectation of 10 growth is inline with the growth rate Apple delivered in Fiscal Q4 and all of Fiscal 2015, yet the dynamics for accelerating growth are clearly present."
1803,52,"While Apple does not report Apple Watch revenue or units, we estimate it sold 3.5 million in the quarter, generating 1.5 billion in revenue. We cut our Fiscal 2016 Apple Watch unit estimate by 15 million, to 35 million, resulting in a 6.3 billion negative impact to our Fiscal 2016 estimate. Those cuts were offset partially by higher revenue estimates for AppleTV and iPod refresh."
1804,52,There is no change to our overall operating margins as a slight increase in our gross margin estimate was offset by slight increases in RD and SGA. Higher other income and a 30 basis point reduction in our estimated tax rate helped offset some of the operating reductions detailed above.
1805,52,"Apple bought back 13.3 billion of stock during the quarter versus our estimate of 12.5 billion. The purchases were also completed at an effective price of 109 versus our 130 estimate at the start of the quarter, resulting in 26 million more shares purchased than we estimated. This helped to offset a 1 billion reduction in our Net Income estimate based on the adjustments above."
1806,52,Our 3.30 FQ1 EPS estimate is at the high end of managements implied guidance range and 0.08 above consensus going into last nights report. Our 10 Fiscal 2016 EPS estimate is 0.20 above consensus. Our revenue estimates are 1 billion higher than consensus for FQ1 and 2.7 billion for the year.
1807,52,"Apple is converting 30 of its revenue into free cash flow, generating 70 billion of free cash flow annually. This implies an 11 FCF yield relative to its 650 billion market cap. That is simply too high of a yield given its market position, expectation of growth and high margins, regardless of the much lower level of revenue growth and EPS expectations for 2016 detailed above."
1808,52,"Even with no growth in EPS, we believe Apples valuation is too low based on cash generation. Apple bought back over 5 of its stock over the past year and will buy in another 6 this year if the stock remains at these levels. . Our 160 price target is based on 16x our Fiscal 2016 EPS estimate of 10."

1861,53,"Amazon was on pace to generate well over 10bn in Other revenue during 2018, which we think includes around"
1862,53,"9bn from advertising, the bulk of which ran in the US. Of the 9bn, around 3bn may have originated with coop"
1863,53,"or traderelated promotion budgets, equivalent to 23 of the companys firstparty sales. In general we think"
1864,53,"these budgets should grow at least as fast as Amazons firstparty sales, but they could grow faster as fast"
1865,53,understanding is that companies in this sector can invest as much as 20 of their revenue in trade promotion
1866,53,"programs with retailers, although we have also heard that the figure can be as low as 2 for some brands."
1867,53,"We assume the remainder, or around 6bn of ad revenue, is derived from conventional digital advertising"
1868,53,budgets. This pool of spending represents a more significant opportunity for Amazon than trade promotion
1869,53,budgets. We estimate the company recognized 5bn in US advertising revenue from conventional ad budgets
1870,53,"during 2018 out of a digital ad market we estimate was worth 106bn, with a large percentage of those sales"

1886,53,fund in isolation from other budgets. Display budgets could flow from general display advertising or from
1887,53,"Facebook or Google or anywhere else. And of course, as Amazon develops its connected TV offerings and"
1888,53,"ultimately makes more of its original programming available on an adsupported basis, it will probably be able to"

1923,53,While AWS probably holds up well because of the secular growth trends it is driving and the longterm contracts it

1973,53,very longterm. For the foreseeable future we expect taxes to be reduced in large part because of the current
1974,53,treatment of stockbased compensation which probably reduces the companys tax bill by around 1.5bn in
1975,53,"2018. At the same time, as evidenced by the companys recent HQ2 contest, the company may very well be able"
1976,53,to play off various governments against each other to realize further savings that extend into the faroff future.

1981,53,Our approach to determining Amazons cost of capital is identical to the approach we use for other companies

1984,53,using costs of capital of 11.4 for the longrun 8.3 in the shortterm that are identical to those we use for

Chris Carey While true for some others too, KO looks unique topline momentum complemented by a relatively advantaged cost structure, while a rebasing of investments in 2021 ad Joe Lachky, CFA spend up nearly 50 means KO has ex to allow costs to track topline momentum, or if needed dial back spend should the world change. Meanwhile, potential upside to volumes awayfromhome recovery and pricemix given ination at bottlers seem plausible Marc Torrente, CFA, CPA through the year. Basically, KO is a ex to beat story, not a stretch to meet... and we like the setup for 2022. Overweight."
2110,56,"We raise our 2022e EPS Raising estimates, target to 69 a model with ex in 2022. Evan Greenblatt to 2.45 was 2.42 with our 2023e EPS to 2.59 was 2.56. We go through the key bridge math below, but the general idea here is that topline momentum is accelerating into 2022 and despite some ination on commodities MSD impact to COGS, theres still a lot of ex namely on SGA, i.e. KO seems in a position to maintain high levels of investment while still comfortably delivering the EPS outlook. Our 69 target was 67 is on an unchanged 26.5x CY23e EPS, 40 vs SPX historical 25 with ex to earnings."
2111,56,"We model 2022e organic sales 7.7, with pricemix 4.5 and REVENUE bridge. concentrate volumes 3.2. Our sense is KO views comps more normal now after several years of volatility, i.e. rate of topline growth should be fairly even through the year, with potentially some modest tailwind in Q1 from slightly easier underlying comps albeit 1 less day in Q1 oset by 1 more day in Q4 is a consideration. In our Pricemix perspective. global bottler deepdive, we argued that bottler readthroughs implied pricing of 5 looked reasonable so while Q421 pricemix was 10 more about comps, we still think 45 is a reasonable starting point KO noting 2022 sales should be balanced between pricemix and volume, albeit we skew more pricemix in our model."
2112,56,"The net of this is that we model GM down GROSS MARGIN bridge see Chart 1. 35bps yy was 50bps as we now fold in BodyArmor 80bps impact at the mid point. Our thinking on the bridge, which we lay out in detail in Chart 1, is as follows pricemix 175bps, channel mix recovery of awayfromhome 95bps, commodities 200bps, FX 70bps, BodyArmor 80bps, with our model implying 50bps from all other productivity and volume leverage being positives for the story in 2022 could be higher in our view. This gets us to our 59.8 gross margin vs 60.1 in 2021. A comment on KO disclosures for the Q4 impact from BA 70bps to GM BodyArmor gross margins. implies that GMs were negative on our math included onetime items however, at 7090bps impact to 2022, this implies BA GMs at roughly 35 for 2022 note BA is seen de minimis to 2022 EPS."
2113,56,"The idea here is that KO rebased its investment levels in 2021, essentially OPEX bridge. going into 2022 with a cleaner foundation. Some context Q4 ad spend was up nearly 50, putting the FY21 ad spend at just over 4.0bn, i.e. up nearly 50 yy and down only modestly from 2019 levels. Selling and distribution expenses grew LSD in Q4, by our math ending the year at 2.6bn, 2 vs 2020. This implies that other expenses were up about 35 in Q4 with the FY up 23. Big picture KOs 2021 momentum allowed it to return to more normal spending levels. For 2022, we model SGA 900mn, embedding ad spend 9 380mn yy to 10.7 vs 10.6 in 2021 with other expenses exstock comp 6 440mn."
2114,56,"Chart 1 We model gross margin 59.8, down 30bps yy, with price and channel mix positives, oset by commodities, FX, BodyArmor. Our model assumes a roughly 50bps benet from volume leverage and productivity"
2115,56,"Investment Thesis We see upside potential to sales as the recovery takes shape with newfound exibility around earnings delivery. We view the dividend as manageable with additional capital deployment potential ahead. Buy the recovery, in our view. Overweight KO. Target Price Valuation for KO 69.00 from 67.00 Our 69 price target is based on a 26.5x PE multiple to our CY23E EPS estimate. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for KO Risks include 1 The global recovery may be slower than we expect 2 Margin improvement could stall 3 The dividend could suer."

2387,59,"Our review of omnichannel retailer commentary and EBAYs upward 2Q guidance revision last week indicate to us continued strength, if not acceleration, in digital commerce from March into April and May, despite brickandmortar retailers beginning to reopen across much of the country. While it is too early to tell whether ecommerce penetration will permanently ratchet higher, strong digital demand appears likely to persist over at least the near to midterm. While digital demand appears to have ramped aggressively, we also note omnichannel retailers have rapidly launched or expanded local fulfillment capabilities leveraging store footprints, and have so far seen an enthusiastic consumer response e.g., TGTs sameday services 278 YoY in its F1Q20. What does this mean for our mostly pureplay ecom coverage? Our view is somewhat mixed, but positive on balance we view accelerating growth and persistence of digital demand as strong positives that likely outweigh enhanced fulfillment capabilities among omnichannel players."
2388,59,"AMZN Raise Estimates, Raise PT to 3,000. While we note ramping local fulfillment capabilities and exceptionally strong e commerce data pts from omnichannel retail competitors, we nonetheless expect that AMZN is likely to benefit from exceptionally strong ecommerce demand in 2Q, likely extending into 2H20. Though we view omnichannel retailers recent progress on BOPIScurbside as very much worth monitoring, we believe that AMZNs continued buildout of lastmile fulfillment capacity and a gradual return to more hectic work and school schedules among consumers will likely shift momentum back toward rapid delivery AMZNs 1day Prime and Prime Now from competitors storebased fulfillment options. Based on our increased forecasts and improving comparative valuations, we have raised our price target to 3,000 23x 2021E EVEBITDA from 2,725 prior and maintain our Overweight rating on AMZN shares."
2389,59,"Estimate Changes. We have raised our ecommerce paid unit growth forecasts for the remainder of 2020 and 2021, and have also modeled higher 3P unit mix vs. our prior forecasts. For 2Q, we now forecast 35.5 unit growth revised upward from 27 prior, and accelerating vs. 32 unit growth reported in 1Q20 and 5446 3P1P unit mix, consistent with 2Q19. Unit growth and 3P mix are also revised upward for 2H and, modestly, for 2021. For 2020, we now forecast revenue of 349B, GAAP Op Income of 11.4B and GAAP EPS of 15.59, vs. prior forecasts of 343B 11.1B 15.11. For 2021, we now forecast revenue of 415B, GAAP Op Income of 24B and GAAP EPS of 35.57 vs. our prior forecasts of 401B 23B 34.51."
2390,59,"Price Target 3000 from 2725 Our valuation is based on a sumoftheparts analysis. Our 3,000 price target represents 23x 2021E EVEBITDA. Risks include ongoing investment in Amazons infrastructure both on the AWS and Retail sides of the business, entries into new retail categories where Amazon is less experienced, competition from traditional brick and mortar players, and challenges expanding into newer international markets such as India."
2391,59,"We remain confident on AMZNs ability to drive penetration of additional retail product categories and key emerging geographies, maintain its lead in cloud computing and execute against additional opportunities such as online advertising across both endemic and nonendemic advertiser categories, which we believe offer the company compelling growth and profit characteristics."
2392,59,"Amazon.com, Inc. offers services to consumers, sellers, and developers through its retail websites. It also manufactures and sells the Kindle ereader. The Company offers programs that enable sellers to sell their products on its websites and their own branded websites. Amazon.com serves developers through Amazon Web Services AWS, which provides access to technology infrastructure that developers can use to enable any type of business. In addition, the Company generates revenue through cobranded credit card agreements and other marketing and promotional services, such as online advertising. Amazon.com has organized its operations into two principal segments North America and International."

2751,63,"Wells Fargo View WMTs interest in India looks to be accelerating, as the company is reportedly in talks with conglomerate Tata Group for a potential investment of up to 2025 billion in its new super app. The super app is expected to launch in December 2020January 2021 and will combine Tatas consumer product offerings onto one platform Tatas consumer businesses include watch and jewelry brand Titan, fashion retail chain Trent, consumer durables and electronics retailer Infiniti Retail, and various key food and beverage brands. News sources indicate that the super app may be launched as a joint venture that would leverage Tatas e commerce business and Flipkart. Note that WMT made another 1.2 billion investment in Flipkart in July, roughly two years after purchasing an almost 80 stake in 2018 for 16 billion. Its clear that some initial operational and regulatory challenges have not deterred the companys interest in this massive market. We view the news as mixed for now. While a path to value creation in Flipkart looks to be evolving positively given the potential for a future IPO, and we applaud managements willingness to think outside the box TikTok is another example here, doubling down on this complicated market is not without risk. Further assessment is difficult without more details. We continue to rate WMT Equal Weight."
2752,63,"Price Target 130 from NC Our 130 price target reflects 25x our NTM earnings estimate. We see numerous upside and downside risks to our Equal Weight ratingtarget. 1. Continued progress in digital could earn greater credibility with investors and a higher valuation. 2. International divestitures would be positive for returns and the stock. 3. Traffic and comps could slow as instore initiatives mature, putting pressure on the stock. 4. Margins could fall by more than expected if digital losses grow, competition intensifies, and costs rise."
2753,63,"WMT has made strong progress in its repositioning against high initial skepticism, and the pace of change should be applauded. The company has essentially turned itself into Amazons biggest online retail competitor while returning its stores to positive traffic growth. We have been impressed with the effort, but simply cannot get behind the stock after its recent run given that structural issues still loom large. E commerce risk is shifting to foodconsumables, hard discount poses a threat, traditional competitors are beginning to fight harder, and the cost of doing business in retail continues to rise. We also find it difficult to ignore the fact that WMT still operates 700 million sq. ft. of selling space 3x its closest peer at a time when retail is under siege, and is the countrys largest grocery store during the most challenging period in the industrys history. As we assess the companys progress against our concerns and the stocks improved valuation, the riskreward appears balanced at current levels."

3163,67,"INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS 1,600.00 Amazon is scheduled to report 4Q17 results at 530pm EST on Thursday, February 1. We expect the company to modestly beat on both revenue and profitability, driven by a strong holiday season, continued strength in AWS, as well as rapidly growing advertising revenue. We reiterate our BUY rating and increase our Expect modest upside on 4Q17 revenue. PT to 1,600 based on sumoftheparts analysis on FY18 estimates. Internet Digital Media We expect 4Q17 revenue to come in at the high end of guidance and ahead of Street expectations due to a strong holiday season both on macro and micro level. We estimate total revenue of 59.9B vs. guidance of 5660.5B and consensus of 59.7B. Our estimate consists of 37.5B N. America rev, above consensus of 36.1B, 17.5B Intl rev, slightly below consensus of 17.9B, and Overall holiday sales exceeded expectations. 5.0B AWS rev, inline with consensus."
3164,67,"On the macro level, we believe 2017 holiday season exceeded expectations. NRF data shows that total retail sales increased 5.5 yy in Nov and Dec, above forecast of 3.64, representing best level since 2010. Ecommerce continued to grow faster than broader retail, which, according to Adobe, increased 14.6 yy, also ahead of prior forecast of 13.8. NetElixir, a search marketing agency who analyzed ecommerce traffic data, estimated 13 yy increase in holiday ecommerce sales, above its 10 initial Strong Prime growth. projection."
3165,67,"We believe Prime continued to be key driver in driving revenue for the company. Amazon added more than 4 million Prime members in one week over the holiday season, above 3M that join over the same period last year. We believe Amazon adds at least 5M Prime membersquarter. Amazon doesnt disclose Higher conversion rate. total count, but CIRPs latest estimate points to 90 million members in U.S. alone."
3166,67,"Amazon also leads other retailers in terms of conversion rate. According to Hitwise, Amazon enjoyed nearly 7 conversion rate during the holiday season, more than double its closest competitor, and conversion for most Stock Price Performance retailers were 13. As a result, Hitwise data showed that Amazon accounted for 39 of total visits but over 69 of total transactions."
3167,67,"Our price target of 1,600 is based on the sumoftheparts analysis, which evaluates North America and International segments using EVRevenue multiple, and AWS segment using EVEBITDA multiple. Our price target is also below 7.3x FY18 sales multiple of its largecap peers. Risks to Target"
3168,67,"Risks to attaining our share price target include, but are not limited to 1 a decline in discretionary consumer spending, 2 slow adoption of Prime membership internationally, 3 increased ecommerce competition both domestically and internationally, 4 slowdown of revenue and operating margin growth of AWS due to competition and continued pricing cuts, 5 lack of traction in new products, such as groceries and home services, and 6 potential regulatory changes and uncertainties particularly in international markets."
3169,68,"WMTs stock has nally caught a break, as the company beat estimates and delivered Edward Kelly, CFA 2022 guidance ahead of expectations in the face of lowend consumer concerns. The top line performed well with a US comp that was about expected. EBIT margin expanded Anthony Bonadio, CFA in the quarter, with a surprisingly strong US gross margin osetting higherthan expected omicron costs. 2022 guidance of EPS growth of 56 was relatively good, but the cadence down lowdouble digits in Q1up high teens in Q4 is likely to leave residual questions. Overall, we came away positive from the update, but would note that broader macro risk remains. The company does look well positioned to see trade down, management seemed to express comfort with its ability to manage ination given its price gaps, and alternative prot streams like advertising are growing. We continue to rate the stock Overweight since WMT should be better positioned than many of its peers in a more challenging 2022."
3170,68,"Adj. EPS of 1.53 beat the consensus expectation of 1.50 and our 1.48. Q4 Highlights Topline beat as both demand and ination remained strong, but was driven largely by the Sams Club banner. US comp growth of 5.6 was in line with consensus, a touch ahead of guidance, and was paced by transaction growth of 3.1 and ticket growth of 2.4. Costs remained a challenge supply chain and wages, but were oset with price management, mix, and lower COVID costs. Allin, the US business EBIT margin deleveraged 27bps on GM expansion and opex deleverage. International sales grew by 6.4 excluding the impact of recent divestitures, driven by strength in Mexico, China, and Flipkart. Sams Club comped 10.4 ex. fuel 7.0 transaction growth and 3.2 ticket growth, with membership income up 9.1. Management set initial 2022 guidance of EPS growth in the MSD range paced by 3 sales growth."
3171,68,"We are raising our 2022 EPS estimate to 6.72 from 6.70, and are Our Estimates establishing a 2023 EPS estimate of 7.10."
3172,68,"Investment Thesis WMT has made strong progress in its repositioning in recent years against high initial skepticism, and the pace of change should be applauded. The company has essentially turned itself into Amazons biggest online retail competitor while returning its stores to positive trac growth. Overall, we have been impressed with the eort. Though the company lost share during COVID, we expect momentum to reaccelerate given normalizing consumer behavior, tailwinds from monthly CTC payments, and easier comparisons relative to other retail peers. While concerns around investment and the magnitude of mediumterm growth remain, WMT looks like a good name to own in consumer at the moment. We rate WMT shares Overweight. Target Price Valuation for WMT 165.00 from NC Our 165 price target reects 25x our 2022 earnings estimate.

3173,69,"We have recently taken a more cautious view on the consumer spending outlook, including moderating our growth forecasts for the smartphone market, which is already limiting the upside we had expected from the launch of the iPhone SE3 and will likely limit the magnitude of upside to iPhone 13 as well as App Store revenue in Services. Thus, we are trimming our earnings forecasts for Apple, led by a modest haircutto our revenue growth estimates for iPhone primarily iPhone SE and Services, although the overall reduction in estimates is fairly modest given the resilience of highend smartphones, tablets and laptops to the broader slowdown in consumer spending. The reduction in estimates from what were above consensus and bullish expectations for iPhone revenue growth is now bringing us largely in line with consensusforecasts for FY22. However, we remain above consensus expectations for FY23 and FY24, led by our forecasts for better than expected growth in Products as well as margin and earnings trajectory on the back of robust growth in Services.Our positive view on the shares longterm leads us to maintain our Overweight rating and Dec22 price target of 210."

We are modestly lowering our streethigh iPhone volume outlook for CY22 to 245 mn, relative to prior estimate for 250 mn, with our estimates for iPhone SE3 moving to 24mn relative to 30 mn prior. Our estimates for iPhone 13 remain largely intact as we expectthe combination of recent color variant launches as well as a higher than typical inventory level in the channel against the backdrop of existing supply chain constraints to provide offsets to lower customer spending."
3175,69,"Services momentum slowing on tough comparables as well as slowing consumer spending on App Store. Gross app store revenue, new downloads, as well as gaming revenue worsened in relation to yy growth trends in C1Q22, which while partly on account of tough comparables is also the first qq sequential moderation in gross revenue since C4Q19. We expect the slower engagement on the App Store to limit Services revenue growth in the 15 20 yy range in FY22 and thus we lower our estimates on ourexpectations for more modest sequential growth in Service revenues through the fiscal year."
3176,69,"Despite increasing headwinds on consumer spending, Apple should drive offsets through market share increases maintain Dec22 PT of 210. Even as our concerns regarding consumer spending momentum have increased in recent months, leading to a downward revision in our unit outlook for the Smartphone market see reporthere, as well as the PC market see reporthere, we continue to see Apple well positioned to deliver resilient performance in Product revenue growth, led by share gains across the different categories of hardware products as both Enterprises and Consumers increasingly adopt higherperformance devices. The offsets and the expected resilience lead us to maintain our Dec22 price target of 210."

3178,70,"The SetUp While we continue to believe WMTs share gains in the nearintermediatelong term are sustainable, we are"
3179,70,concerned 4Q results could be a little noisy given the industry backdrop in Toys and the potential for some weakness in
3180,70,Electronics. Investors certainly also appear concerned given that WMTs stock is down 2.9 YTD versus the SP up
3181,70,3.9 meaning the bar has come down for 4Q but the overriding concern beyond 4Q is whether or not a weaker than
3182,70,expected 4Q on comp andor Ecomm growth will play in to the resurfacing of an AMZN oneday Prime competitive
3183,70,"narrative. Along these lines, there appears to be a view that WMT will have to unveil a next wave of digital investments"
3184,70,to address AMZN if in fact top line slowed in 4Q. While we believe any potential softness in 4Q is transient in nature
3185,70,and related to noise more than anything we appreciate the fact that investors will remain cautious until the AMZN
3186,70,"narrative dissipates. Net while we are cautious going in to results, the thesis remains intact and we would"
3187,70,"In this note, we provide color on the debates we are engaged in heading in to next Tuesday but our quick take on the"
3188,70,"First, while we understand the trepidation surrounding 4Q comps, the quarter will be exceptionally noisy shortened"
3189,70,"holiday season, SNAP impact in 2019 and also 2013 etc., so sentiment will largely hinge on the context management"
3190,70,"the extent key holiday categories such as toys and electronics simply slowed across the industry, WMT is not immune"
3191,70,"but we think the 4Q comps bar is now 2 . On the other hand, to the extent six fewer holiday shopping days was"
3192,70,the bigger problem as we believe it was WMT should
3193,70,b see normalized trends post the holidays ex. the January SNAP headwind so to the extent WMT would be willing to
3194,70,c benefit given the nondiscretionary nature of their sales mix to the extent shopping trips were consolidated.
3195,70,"Said differently, while we firmly believe the shortened holiday period impacted many retailers, and believe 4Q results"
3196,70,"might play in to the AMZN narrative for now, we do not believe the next day offering impacted WMTs sales, although we"
3197,70,acknowledge we might not be proven right until WMT reports 1Q on May 19th.
3198,70,"Second, we do not believe WMT will need to engage in a next wave of ecomm investments. The AMZN oneday Prime"
3199,70,narrative has driven in part concern amongst some investors that WMT will need to invest much more in digital to
3200,70,"keep up with AMZN. To us, the unveiling of additional large scale digital investment would run counter to"
3201,70,"much of WMTs communication to the Street, and, perhaps more importantly, appears neither necessary"
3202,70,"nor likely given the acceleration in core U.S. EBIT trends. Instead, we believe WMT will drive home the message"
3203,70,"that 1 its investment plans have been appropriate, and profitability rate is set to inflect in the nearmedium term and"
3204,70,"2 it continues to separate itself from the pack especially from conventional grocers with respect to value, customer"
3205,70,Notwithstanding the 4Q comp trend which may come in below consensus and investor concerns
3206,70,"emerging addressed in detail below, we expect Tuesdays meeting to be constructive and remain bullish"
3207,70,"on WMT. We maintain our 135 price target, which reflects a 12x FY21 EVEBITDA and implies 17 upside vs the"
3208,70,"Below, we highlight 4 key investor concerns which reflect the debates we are engaged in heading in to next"
3209,70,"Key Investor Concern 1 Comps have slowed, causing an AMZN oneday Prime narrative to surface."
3210,70,"In general, based on our conversations, investors have triangulated TGTs weak comp, the sequential softening of credit"
3211,70,"card data for Walmart, and the recent resignation of former U.S. Chief merchant Steve Bratspies, to mean that U.S. core"
3212,70,"comps in 4Q will be somewhat squishy. As a reminder, WMTs FY20 U.S. comp expectations gravitated toward 3 for"
3213,70,the year after Augusts guidance update in which management said comps would be towards the upperend of 2.5
3214,70,"to 3. So following 3Q results, which did not materially alter full year expectations, implied 4Q expectations were"
3215,70,"initially in the high 2 range. We now believe investors expect a 1.52 comp in 4Q. As a result, investors are"
3216,70,"Our rebuttal While comp may come in below consensus, the root cause is likely transitory based on Toys and"
3217,70,"Electronics noise, but we also believe WMT may have been somewhat insulated given WMTs nondiscretionary exposure"
3218,70,"at 65 of sales. Separately, WMTs ecommerce platform continues to be well positioned vs. Amazon with nextday"
3219,70,"By now, it is pretty clear that the 6 fewer holiday shopping days wreaked havoc across bricks and mortar retail, as"
3220,70,"consumers were timestrapped and likely relied on faster delivery options, or in some cases did not make that marginal"
3221,70,"holiday purchase at all. That said, while certainly not immune, we believe WMT was somewhat insulated from"
3222,70,"from grocery, HBA and Rx, and b a relatively well developed digital platform, which reached 75 of the"
3223,70,population with free next day delivery during the holidays. WMTs sameday grocery platform also continued to
3224,70,"migrate general merchandise items into it, adding yet another layer of convenience. Further, WMTs food shop results in"
3225,70,"a much higher frequency of necessary visits, and given the shortened holiday season, customers may have been"
3226,70,"customers are timestrapped, and WMTs expansion of free next day delivery was likely a key differentiating factor. All"
3227,70,"that said, any potential weakness, if attributed mostly to the 6 fewer shopping days, is only temporary."
3228,70,"With respect to specific categories, it is admittedly unclear if the 6 fewer days directly caused certain"
3229,70,"categories, such as toys and electronics, to be weak, or if underlying trends in these categories are just"
3230,70,"soft. We tend to believe it is a combination of both. For context, while WMT no longer breaks out its electronics"
3231,70,category was broken out and electronics alone is likely in the 13 of sales range in 4Q versus 10 annually.
3232,70,"In toys, after last years windfall for retailers from the Toys R Us bankruptcy, the category overall appears to have slowed,"
3233,70,"trending down during the holidays. To us, many retailers appeared to have relied too much on a the benefit from Frozen"
3234,70,"assortments nearly everyone was carrying Frozen products, and b continued share gains in the category not"
3235,70,"everyone can gain share. Furthermore, the TRU liquidation in 2018 may have resulted in a lot of excess inventory sold"
3236,70,during the 2018 holidays that the industry lapped in 2019 a potential headwind. While WMT will likely outperform
3237,70,"the overall category, our sense is that toys in general will not be a great category for WMT."
3238,70,"In electronics, reads appear to be mixed as despite TGTs soft result and no clear signs of strength at AMZN, COST which"
3239,70,also has a big grocery business performed well in its majors category which includes electronics in NovDec and
3240,70,"industry datapoints suggest BBY is taking share. It is worth noting that BBY, like WMT offers free next day delivery on the"
3241,70,"majority of purchases. While we dont necessarily expect a strong showing, our sense is that WMT may be"
3242,70,"Finally, we wouldnt read anything into the departure of former Chief U.S. Merchant Steve Bratspies with"
3243,70,"respect to 4Q trends. WMT often makes executive changes right before the end of the fiscal year, and new leadership"
3244,70,"at WMT U.S. from John Furner who replaced Greg Foran after his departure may have catalyzed more change. Further,"
3245,70,"Mr. Bratspies was apparently passed over for the WMT U.S. and Sams CEO jobs, so in light of those facts, his departure"
3246,70,"Key Investor Concern 2 There is a next wave of digital investments needed to address AMZN, which"
3247,70,"The core U.S. business has continued to grow EBIT sustainably in the MSD range. However, continued MSD core growth"
3248,70,"relies in the premises that a WMT has been investing appropriately, and does not need a significant new wave of"
3249,70,"digital investments, and b WMT can deliver steady comp performance needed to drive SGA leverage given ongoing"
3250,70,"GM pressure. Tying this into the AMZN oneday Prime narrative, investors are worried that WMT will need to invest"
3251,70,"4 for FY21, concerns have emerged that WMT will guide to LSD EBIT growth or lower."
3252,70,Our rebuttal WMTs strong underlying growth trajectory is sustainable and is still early stage on gaining momentum.
3253,70,Consensus appears reasonable as it relates to how WMT will guide but if we had to bet on where FY21 EPS will
3254,70,"ultimately settle to be clear not guide we believe it will be closer to 6. Said differently, even if WMT guides below"
3255,70,"A MSD EBIT algorithm is supported by multiple comp drivers. Despite the nearterm noise, WMTs comp trajectory"
3256,70,"commerce efficiency initiatives, and the evolution of the supercenter addition of WMT Health are areas where we"
3257,70,"expect management to provide more color on Tuesday. Again, we do not believe AMZNs oneday Prime rollout has"
3258,70,We dont share most investors margin concerns for the following reasons
3259,70,1. We believe WMTs investment cadence in recent years has built up the appropriate digital foundation
3260,70,whereby additional largescale margincapex investments are not necessary. While it is practically impossible
3261,70,"to parse out exactly how much WMT has invested in technologydigital in recent years, we believe the largest"
3262,70,"talent engineers etc., and robust appdata analytics development are generally behind the company."
3263,70,2. WMT has generally communicated to the Street that digital profitability rate will inflect while the
3264,70,"exact timing is unknown, we dont envision a dramatic change in tone. Along these lines, WMT has discussed"
3265,70,improving profitability trends due in part to 1 the continued mirroring of SKUs across EDCs significantly lowers split
3266,70,shipmentsshipping costs 2 the potential for fixed cost leverage as ecommerce top line continues to grow quickly 3
3267,70,technology is increasingly leveraged. We believe WMTs ecommerce business can continue to grow the top line
3268,70,"3. EDLC should continue to be prominent. While cost pressure from wagessupply chain may continue, we argue"
3269,70,that SGA progress will also be a function of sales growth matched with efficiencies leveraging technology and new
3270,70,"processes to reduce the work associates do in inventory management, stocking, checkout visàvis selfcheckouts"
3271,70,Lapping Flipkart dilution should also boost enterprisewide growth. WMT has been clear that it continues to plan
3272,70,for a significant business in India in the future. While Flipkart is a business that has increased the level of anxiety for
3273,70,"investors in the past given regulatory hurdles in India, WMT has said that the business has performed as initially"
3274,70,"expected, so FY20 losses are likely in the 0.60 range. We estimate Flipkart was a 0.40 incremental headwind"
3275,70,"in FY20 and EPS growth ex Flipkart will be 9 in FY20 so lapping this should result in, at least, a MSD"
3276,70,"will be volatility with respect to India, the general tone coming out of WMT is that operating losses are being ringfenced."
3277,70,Investors will be listening closely for any change in tone with regards to India and also WMTs plans for the PhonePe
3278,70,"asset, which has been valued at 10B per media discussions."
3279,70,"Our thoughts on FY21 guidance WMT will provide FY21 guidance on Tuesday, but do not expect the company to"
3280,70,"quantify earnings expectations beyond FY21. The Streets FY21 EPS forecast of 5.23 reflects 4.6 EPS growth, and"
3281,70,"includes a 2.8 U.S. comps, b 4.5 growth in U.S. EBIT, and c 4.0 growth in consolidated EBIT. We are forecasting"
3282,70,"growing concern that WMT will guide to LSD EBIT growth or even lower, similar to initial FY20 guidance. While we"
3283,70,"wouldnt rule this out, such guidance will ultimately prove to be very conservative in our view. We believe an"
3284,70,"appropriate framework should include LSD U.S. comps, LMSD operating income growth, and MSD EPS"
3285,70,Key Investor Concern 3 Execution in grocery will suffer in the wake of former U.S. CEO Greg Forans
3286,70,"recent years particularly the strides made in fresh. As a result, some investors are antsy about WMTs strategic"
3287,70,Our rebuttal The grocery landscape is unfolding in a manner that is increasingly favorable for WMT. Our checks
3288,70,suggest the gap in conventional grocery between WMT and direct competitors continues to expand in the two most
3289,70,"With respect to value specifically, our pricing checks indicate that pricing gaps to competitors such as"
3290,70,"Kroger continue to widen. While CPI inflation has trended below 1 in recent months, KR noted in its 3Q call that its"
3291,70,"own price inflation has been above 1. Conversely, WMT noted that it actually saw slight deflation in food despite"
3292,70,"higher costs in 3Q and some consumables inflation, although a lot of that inflation was not passed on to customers due"
3293,70,"to investments. In our view, KR has been increasingly less focused on EDLP and more focused on convincing"
3294,70,"Furthermore, we believe many other grocers are following KRs lead on pricing. As we survey the grocery"
3295,70,"landscape we see a Aholds limited overlap with WMT in its key markets so can follow KRs lead, b Albertsons has"
3296,70,"highlighted Fresh as a meaningful competitive advantage, c Publix having never really been focused on price"
3297,70,"competition, d 30 of grocery retail consisting of struggling grocers who would welcome price increases, and e"
3298,70,medium sizelarger grocers who are likely eager to take price given the low inflation environment and the significant
3299,70,The notion that competitors have sustainable pricing power in WMTs markets due to an edge in fresh is
3300,70,"questionable, to say the least. In recent years WMT went through a period when it made ample strides in fresh"
3301,70,"particularly in produce and narrowed the gap vs. competitors. Going forward, progress will be driven by ongoing"
3302,70,"initiatives, such as the latest improvements in supply chain and presentation including Produce 2.0. We dont believe"
3303,70,WMTs progress is being fully appreciated by competitors the argument that WMTs quality is vastly inferior
3304,70,"and, as a result, competitors can sustain price increases in fresh categories does not hold water, in our view. As such, we"
3305,70,believe WMT is in an increasingly favorable position for outsized share gains as price gaps widen vs. competitors.
3306,70,"With respect to convenienceshopping experience, we expect to hear more on Tuesday about continued"
3307,70,enhancements to the grocery ecommerce platform. WMT has aggressively pursued its U.S. rollout of grocery e
3308,70,that WMT expects to eventually merge its Blue and Orange apps this is not new but timeline remains unknown as it
3309,70,"grocery experience is unmatched. AMZN continues to be on everyones radar, but the reality is that AMZN"
3310,70,has not done a whole lot with Whole Foods in grocery thus far. While Amazon Fresh is incrementally more
3311,70,"competitive after dropping its delivery fees for Prime members, WMTs EDLP pricing Amazon Fresh priced at a premium"
3312,70,"in our studies, even after delivery fees, store pickup options, and availability give WMT a significant edge."
3313,70,"Key Investor Concern 4 Several of WMTs culture carriers have departed, resulting in a talent void at the"
3314,70,"In the wake of Greg Forans and Steve Bratspiess departures, we believe some investors are concerned about a U.S."
3315,70,leadership void andor a meaningful change in the culture which has allowed WMT to perform well in recent years.
3316,70,"Additionally, speculation about the role, and potential departure of CEO of U.S. Ecommerce, Marc Lore has also been a"
3317,70,Our rebuttal WMTs talent bench is deep and its culture will continue to evolve under the stewardship of Walmart Inc.
3318,70,CEO Doug McMillon and new U.S. CEO John Furner. It is unlikely U.S. Ecommerce CEO Marc Lore would leave until his

3328,70,Walmart Health The addition of the Walmart Health center remains one of the most unique opportunities

3334,70,WMTs goal of improving access to basicpreventative healthcare at affordable prices provides another potential traffic

3523,72,"PEP delivered a strong Q420 though shares were 2.0 vs SPX 0.2, XLP 0.4. While Chris Carey a sellthenews trend on EPS day across Staples recently is a factor, to the extent there is more to read into the move, wed oer 1 FY21 delivery builds through the FY with Joe Lachky, CFA Q1 a low water mark 2 we modestly lower EPS today 3 language on PBNA margins seems to have evolved ever so slightly, with a midteens margin seen longterm without parameters of a timeline, though we acknowledge PEP never set an ocial timeline. Marc Torrente, CFA Overall, we view PEP as one of the most consistently solid companies in Staples. We also think this is understood and, with negative sentiment on Staples, and upside in shares dependent on multiple expansion tough in the current tape, we stay Equal Weight."
3524,72,"While PEP has been clear it wont PBNA midteens margins seem a bit more elusive... sacrice sustainability in PBNA just to drive margins, and reiterated that stance today, mgmt noted today we see this business longterm at midteens and also the unit could get into the teens margins over the long run. The use of longer term several times seemed a bit more incremental, eschewing any parameters on timeline some margin is dependent on the success of Rockstar, of course, set for relaunch this year."
3525,72,...PBNA margins are the one area we could see getting PEP EPS above algorithm. Recall in our Dec 7 deepdive Pepsis Challenge PBNA Still Feel a Bit Blindfolded we argued that PBNA reaching a midteens margin over a timeline of a few years our understanding of the targeted glide path was likely the one area in the PEP model that could drive prot growth above PEPs algorithm nearterm even if our ultimate view was that such a timeline was likely untenable.
3526,72,CEO Laguarta noted weve all learned that there are Promos a potential swing factor. some opportunities there. But Im sure there will be a little bit of additional promotional eorts as the world opens. Our read is PEP as with peers likely tries to hold promos lower ahead. See our 28 promo deepdive Heard About These Low Promotions? Heres Everything You Need to Know for promo cuts by PEP and peers in 2020.
3527,72,"PEP noted expectations for Q121 organic sales up LSD Key considerations for Q121. with margins lower yy cycling preCOVID comps, and with negative FX, mix including MA, i.e. Pioneer, and remaining COVID costs. We model organic sales 1.5, reecting a at twoyear stack 9.4 with reported sales 4.9 on slightly negative FX and with MA. We expect gross margin 90bps driving operating margin 60bps, with EPS 1.11."
3528,72,"PEP set FY21 guidance for EPS HSD exFX, with 1pt FX to Lower 2021e2022e EPS. EPS, implying core EPS 810 on a 5.52 base, or 5.966.07. We lower 2021e2022e EPS to 6.026.57 from 6.086.63, with organic sales actually modestly higher to 4.3 vs prior 4.1, with op prot 0.7 vs prior belowtheline adjustments higher pension, interest expense, and 50bps higher tax rate drive the lower EPS."
3529,72,"PEP has a history of hitting PEP upside probably depends on multiple expansion. numbers and we see enough here in 2021 upside to algorithm is less clear though. The net is PEP needs multiple expansion, a hard pitch in a negative sentiment Staples tape."
3530,72,"Our new target is 22.5x our CY22e Lower target to 147 from 157 on cut to multiple. EPS, 1pt vs our prior target, reecting multiple contraction in Staples."
3531,72,Our 147 price target is based on a 22.5x PE multiple to our CY22E EPS estimate.
3532,72,Downside risks 1 PEP is global and the world faces many risks that could slow its category growth COVIDrelated for ex and thus company revenueearnings 2 PBNA margins remaining stagnant would aect our EPS estimates that embed improvement. Upside risks 1 PBNA margins accelerating could drive upside to earnings. 2 a faster global recovery which would drive PEPs foodservice business.
3533,72,"PEP results have been resilient amidst COVID and with a consistent algorithm and valuation in line with historicals, we expect the stock to track the group. We carry a positive lean and recognize the case that could drive earnings catalysts. We simply need time to assess if these scenarios become reality, namely PBNA, and view EPS expectations as reasonable for now, hence the Equal Weight rating."
3534,73,The WMT debate ahead of next Tuesdays earnings is shaping up to be one of the more controversial in recent memory. A
3535,73,"confluence of factors has left investors increasingly skittish about what we will hear from WMT on Tuesday, with the focus"
3536,73,"revolving around market share loss concerns. As discussed herein, while indications are that WMT lost share in 2Q our"
3537,73,proprietary analysis using Numerator implies customer behavior has resulted in a tale of two halves so far this year. In
3538,73,"other words, WMT gained a lot of share early on in the pandemic in 1Q and lost share in 2Q, but we believe this is"
3539,73,evidence of volatile shopping patterns for better or worse that are transitory in our view. Recent share loss is easily
3540,73,"and likely explainable because there is a convenience factor in this new environment, but the situation is probably"
3541,73,"transitory in nature. The point is, WMT didnt all of a sudden stray from their core culture and strengths, nor did"
3542,73,competitors markedly improve their own operations over the last few months this share shift is simply a function of
3543,73,"outlets such as travel, entertainment, restaurants etc which we think will ultimately normalize."
3544,73,"More importantly, when the dust settles, we see nothing that threatens WMTs standing as a longterm winner in the"
3545,73,"space. Indeed, we stand by our contention that WMT continues to do what is fundamentally right for the business not"
3546,73,"raising prices during a pandemic, and believe that concerns about nearterm market share are overdone and will"
3547,73,"ultimately prove irrelevant as we begin to emerge to a new normal. Separately, Walmarts M.O. is to be there for the"
3548,73,"customer at all times, so we would not rule out additional price investments in these times to even further widen the gap"
3549,73,with the conventional competitor set. We have many examples of how WMT has lowered prices in the past to take
3550,73,advantage of market share opportunities and we would not be surprised whatsoever if WMT pulls this price investment
3551,73,"trigger once again in this most unique environment. As we have said in the past, all the best retailers grocery,"
3552,73,discretionary etc. invest in price at the most opportune moments when they are in position to do so. WMT is in position
3553,73,"to do so, especially when local and regional players are raising prices to drive margins. We believe this is the most"
3554,73,opportune time and moment for WMT to invest again in price to take share.
3555,73,"In this note, we address several of the key topicsconcerns driving WMT sentiment today including 1 the"
3556,73,debate around recent market share datapoints and comps 2 margin considerations 3 WMTs restructuring
3557,73,"Key Topic 1 The Market ShareComp Debate This is the most important topic of conversation for the stock, as"
3558,73,concerns that WMT is undercomping the competition as a result of COVID have emerged. 3 main funnels of information
3559,73,have fueled concerns 1 scanner data have reflected lagging sales for the mass channel vs. the conventional channel
3560,73,since the COVID outbreak 2 several of WMTs vendors POST and BRBR for example have discussed Mass channel
3561,73,share loss and 3 credit card data appears to have been soft recently per our conversations with investors we dont

3563,73,"Numerator data, which includes ecommerce, shows a tale of two halves so far this year in aggregate for"

3565,73,"data does not capture July, a month we believe consumer behavior likely returned to a more normalized"
3566,73,"pattern . In calendar 2Q20 Figure 1, WMT lost 3.1 of its market share when we include AMZN in the dataset and lost"
3567,73,"This was a meaningful reversal from calendar 1Q20 Figure 2 when WMT had considerable share gains of 4.4, and"
3568,73,"4.7 including and excluding AMZN, or 107 bps and 117 bps including and excluding AMZN respectively. We believe the"
3569,73,convenience factor of going to a local grocer instead of a potentially further away more crowded big box may have
3570,73,"contributed to this share loss in 2Q. Additionally as this is market share, the 2Q share loss could also be very much"
3571,73,"explained by WMTs EDLP strategy as competitors ceased all promotions and benefited from higher throughput, while"
3572,73,"WMT obviously retained its EDLP gotomarket strategy. We do, however, acknowledge the gap to TGT is surprising and"
3573,73,will look for more color on this when both companies report next week.
3574,73,"As you can see in the consolidated calendar 1H20 Figure 3 below, WMTs share levels increased 1.2 excluding AMZN"
3575,73,"and increased 0.6 including AMZN. Looking at changes in bps share, excluding AMZN, WMT increased its aggregate"
3576,73,"share in these categories by 32 bps in 1H20, but gains were a more muted 15bp when we include AMZN. Excluding"
3577,73,"AMZN, we acknowledge share gains were more muted than TGT, DG and Publix, and also acknowledge the bricks and"
3578,73,"mortar Walmart lost share made up for by ecommerce, but in this omnichannel world, we care about total share"
3579,73,especially for Walmart given its dominance in pickup and online. We would also highlight the fact that the Kroger
3580,73,banner lost more share than Walmart although in the bricks and mortar world this was made up for by the other
3581,73,"banners. Excluding AMZN, ACI gained less share than WMT and KR at only 13bp, although as a change in total share,"
3582,73,"ACI outpaced WMT. Based on our analysis at ACI, many banners lost share including JewelOsco, ACME, and Shaws."
3583,73,"While the 2Q20 share loss for WMT could worry some, we see it as transitory and point to 1Q20 and overall 1H20 share"
3584,73,gains as proof that WMTs long term strategy of being there for the customer will win in the end.
3585,73,"With respect to the scanner data, as you can see in Figure 4 below , Nielsen store scanner data does show"
3586,73,sales growth in the conventional Food channel conventional grocers outpacing the Other MultiOutlet Stores i.e.
3587,73,"Mass, Club, Dollar etc.. The yy dollar sales growth gap between these channels is 12pts since the outbreak of COVID"
3588,73,"19. However, we believe two nuances in interpreting the data help explain some of the gap. First, we believe"
3589,73,"that conventional grocers have pulled promotions more significantly andor taken more pricing during the pandemic,"
3590,73,"while WMT has been investing in price despite inflation so higher prices by conventionals is a factor, in our view."
3591,73,"Second, price increases at conventional combined with higher utilization i.e. the assets were previously very"
3592,73,"underutilized, by definition will lead to higher dollar growth at the conventions. Third , the Nielsen data does not capture"
3593,73,"ecommerce delivery data for retailers such as Walmart and ecommerce is a significant growth driver for WMT, rising"
3594,73,"To be clear, we acknowledge the validity of some industry datapoints, as there are logical reasons why WMT sales may"
3595,73,be lagging other grocers and some of WMTs vendors have discussed share loss. It shouldnt come as a surprise that
3596,73,"there are a lot of poorly managed, low productivity, grocery retailers that likely benefited significantly"
3597,73,more from COVIDrelated demand. Simply by virtue of carrying highly demanded goods in a potentially less
3598,73,"frequented and perhaps closer geographically in some cases format, these grocers may have increased sales at a very"
3599,73,"fiscal stimulus. None of this is sustainable, however, in our view."
3600,73,"To conclude the evidence on market share reflects losses for WMT in 2Q, but what we are sure of is that WMTs"
3601,73,competitors did not improve as merchantsoperators so markedly overnight . Nor will the consumers current
3602,73,"disregard for price andor the potential fear of contagion in big box stores last very long if that is, in fact, what we are"
3603,73,"witnessing. As noted above, Figure 3 shows the Other MultiOutlet Stores i.e. Mass, Club, Dollar etc. growth lagging"
3604,73,"during COVID, but look at the consistent share gains in the Other channel preCOVID dating back to 2016. We think"
3605,73,"such multiyear gains in the mass channel i.e. WMT speak to the enduring strength of WMTs model. Conversely,"
3606,73,"inferior retailers will lose any nearterm share gains quickly, while retailers such as WMT that provide value and"
3607,73,convenience with a superior omnichannel platform while positively engaging customerscommunities will benefit from
3608,73,"stickier sales growth. That customer stickiness is the postCOVID prize, in our view."
3609,73,"We are forecasting 2Q U.S. comps of 5 vs. consensus of 5.7, industry data points seem to range from"
3610,73,4.58. Recall that WMT said it had a solid start to May driven by fiscal stimulus. General merchandise categories
3611,73,"were likely boosted by government payments, while grocery clearly remained elevated industrywide given the shift to"
3612,73,"FAFH to FAH, as reads from KR and ACI suggest high teens MayJune industry growth. Notably, we look forward to more"
3613,73,Key Topic 2 Margin Considerations Investments and COVID19 related costs will continue to limit flowthrough in
3614,73,"the nearterm. We expect margins to once again be pressured in 2Q given a hero pay in the U.S., b continued"
3615,73,"inflation a move which will be remembered by customers, in our view, as well as e weakness in International. As a"
3616,73,"reminder, most of Walmarts International markets lag by 1 month from a reporting perspective so April, May, and June"
3617,73,"results will be factored into 2Q results vs. May, June, and July for the U.S. and Canada. April was an especially difficult"
3618,73,"month for International markets, which, for example, saw COVID related store closures in South Africa, and severe"
3619,73,"government limitations on what was allowed to be sold in India. As stated earlier, we wouldnt rule out a more aggressive"
3620,73,"With respect to COVID related costs in more detail, management noted that it would be reasonable to assume 2Q costs"
3621,73,similar to 1Qs 900M in incremental costs 670M in the U.S.. While WMT noted that its second round of associate
3622,73,"bonuses of 370M would impact 2Q, in late July, the company then announced another 428M in bonuses that will be"
3623,73,"paid out on Aug. 20 . It is unclear if these bonus payments will be expensed on the PL in 2Q or 3Q, although we"
3624,73,believe our modeled yy SGA increase of 1.2B in 2Q has enough cushion to absorb the third payment.
3625,73,"The sustainability of high labor costs will be a topic of focus on the call, but investors will also focus on the"
3626,73,"degree to which WMT has improved efficienciesoperations. As we explain in more detail below, recent news that"
3627,73,"WMT is eliminating hundreds of jobs in store planning, logistics, and duplicative merchandising reflects the ongoing"
3628,73,"sales leverage should drive better ecommerce profitability. We note, although WMT did eliminate jobs at corporate, the"
3629,73,company has also hired 400k employees at the store level during the pandemic to meet higher demand.
3630,73,"Overall, we are forecasting a 46 bps drop in Walmart Inc. operating margins in 2Q, including a 30 bps"
3631,73,decline in the U.S. Consensus is at down 30 bps.
3632,73,"Key Topic 3 Recent Restructuring ActionsLeadership Changes As alluded to above, recently made some"
3633,73,changes at the corporate level to eliminate redundant or less productive positions. Some investors have read these
3634,73,moves as a cost cutting exercise in the face of slowing sales growth. We believe the moves reflect the continued
3635,73,"more agile, efficient, and nimble organization. We do not believe that the restructuring has anything to do with"
3636,73,"recent sales trends or, more specifically, the grocery share loss narrative described above. Many of the job cuts are"
3637,73,"operations, which was already discussedannounced, but hadnt yet been acted on in terms of consolidating"
3638,73,rolesfunctions largely because COVID meant all hands on deck for the better part of the last 4 months.
3639,73,"With respect to leadership, we believe the recent departure of Sean Slovenski, former SVP of Health and"
3640,73,"Wellness at Walmart U.S. is also an extension of U.S. CEO John Furner putting his imprint on the business,"
3641,73,specifically the health and wellness opportunity. Mr. Slovenskis departure has been cited by some as a sign of
3642,73,"turmoil at WMT in the midst of slowing salesshare loss. However, we suspect the change may be a function of Mr."
3643,73,Key Topic 4 Recent Ecommerce Developments Two important topics are top of mind regarding Walmarts e
3644,73,"commerce business and will likely garner attention on the 2Q call 1 news about the Walmart rollout, and 2 news"
3645,73,With respect to Walmart press reports have surfaced that Walmart planned to launch the Walmart program in
3646,73,July a program which would enable unlimited same day delivery of grocery and other goods from Supercenters along
3647,73,We believe the program has been in the budget for some time now and see this as the natural progression of the
3648,73,Walmart Delivery Unlimited program which WMT began testing in November of last year. Delivery Unlimited was being
3649,73,"tested in 1,600 stores covering 50 of the population. According to press reports, while COVID pushed back the initial"
3650,73,"launch timeframe of MarchApril into July, the press has speculated the launch has been delayed again, fueling"
3651,73,speculation about soft U.S. sales trends causing the delay. We believe any delay is more a function of the need to
3652,73,"continue to navigate the ongoing COVID crisis, and not related to top line trends. More importantly,"
3653,73,traction with the subscription model could go a long way in extending the moat around Walmarts business
3654,73,"given WMTs positioning in grocery and unique assets. We are hopeful more details will emerge on the 2Q call, but"
3655,73,also suspect a delay if there even is one could be tied to Instacart even though it is apparently only in test mode.
3656,73,"With respect to Instacart On August 11th, CNBC reported and quoted an Instacart spokesperson that Walmart"
3657,73,"would launch a pilot with Instacart in 4 markets across California and Oklahoma. On one hand , since 2015, WMT has"
3658,73,"proven its culture is always open to change but before any final decision is made, WMT follows a disciplined and"
3659,73,"deliberate testing strategy. This could be just a test. On the other hand , we were surprised. While we are not privy to"
3660,73,"any details regarding the test data sharing, fee structure, for example, we have for some time applauded WMT for"
3661,73,building out its own endtoend solution vs. most other grocers reliance on Instacart. Our position is that retailers who
3662,73,"have the scale to build out their own endtoend ecommerce solution should do so given the benefits from data assets,"
3663,73,"inventory visibility, customervendor relationships, and eventual cost optimization. As such, it is unclear to us what to"
3664,73,We are forecasting 2Q21 EPS of 1.16 vs. consensus of 1.25. WMT has pivoted its focus on making the necessary
3665,73,"investments to serve its customers and workers during the pandemic. Gross margin, incremental COVID19 related costs,"
3666,73,and overall topline flow through will be top of mind as investors are looking to gauge the stickiness of costs and the
3667,73,"impact to profitability going forward. The Street is forecasting a gross margin of 24.6, a 30bp decrease yy likely due to"
3668,73,"mix shift, more or less consistent with our projections of a 20bp decline. Tailwinds to gross margin to offset mix may"
3669,73,include a less promotional environment and less shrink. SGA costs are likely to be substantial given WMTs investment
3670,73,"in additional labor and cleaning costs. Consensus estimates overall SGA, including both labor and other incremental"
3671,73,"COVID19 related costs, to be 27.6B vs our 28.0B forecast. Despite the nearterm noise on cost, we believe WMT"

Here, the shape of results will be different pricing to counteract commodityFXother inflation will remain, but much less so vs 2022 PEP will need to slow the rate of SGA increases relative to recent years, Marc Torrente, CFA, CPA unless it overdelivers on organic sales again and, the company will be lapping the benefit of an extra week in N. America in Q4. Scope of beats may narrow with multiple expansion tougher. That said, PEP has its hands firmly on the wheel of its own destiny here.

3971,75,"This should wrap into 2023, and we Confirmation on incremental pricing in Q422. expect pricing to remain the key driver of organic sales growth even if lesser vs 2022. We model 2023 organic sales 6 yy with pricing 5 and volume 1."
3972,75,"Commodity inflation was a 42 headwind to op profit Inflation likely to carry into FY23. in Q3, or a 14.5 impact to COGS. Based on our commodity model, we see 11.84.8 to COGS in FY22FY23 i.e., inflation slowing in FY23, but not reversing. PEP hedges 69 months ahead, so most of the FY23 commodity bucket is unhedged."

3978,75,"Investment Thesis PEP results have been resilient amidst COVID and with a consistent algorithm and valuation in line with historicals, we expect the stock to track the group. We carry a positive lean and recognize the case that could drive earnings catalysts. We simply need time to assess if these scenarios become reality, namely PBNA, and view EPS expectations as reasonable for now, hence the Equal Weight rating. Target Price Valuation for PEP 174.00 from 172.00 Our 174 price target is based on a 24x PE multiple to our CY23 EPS estimate. This is a 50 premium to SPX vs. historically 25, reflecting PEPs defensive qualities in the current macro backdrop, but below other largecap peers with better visibility on earnings. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for PEP Downside risks include 1 PEP is global and the world faces many risks that could slow its category growth COVIDrelated for ex and thus, company revenueearnings 2 PBNA margins remaining stagnant would affect our EPS estimates that embed improvement. Upside risks include 1 PBNA margins accelerating could drive upside to earnings, and 2 a faster global recovery, which would drive PEPs foodservice business."

4216,79,Our 2021 estimate goes to 15.32 from 14.89 and our 2022 estimate goes to 11.59 from 11.67.
4217,79,The increase in our FY21 is largely due to the 3Q beat.
4218,79,"The decrease in our FY22 isnt material... but reflects a few moving pieces including weaker card fees, slightly higher expenses, the impact of a 2b preferred issuance in 3Q and net II benefit from deployment of some cash into securities periodend securities were 30b higher than the 3Q average."
4219,79,"Recall that JPM has deployed less cash into securities than some banks, preferring to wait for higher rates. Periodend securities rose by 24b this qtr and mgmt signaled additional purchases were possible. However, a material increase in the securities book still seems unlikely with rates at current levels as JPM views the long term return as being too low."
4220,79,"That said, JPM has a ton of dry powder to add securities over time if rates rise andor they change their view on rates. On todays call, we asked how much this could be if rates rise to a level that mgmt felt comfortable would generate a good long term return. JPM noted it could easily deploy 200b of cash into securities."
4221,79,This 200b compares to nearly 600b of excess deposit growth since 4Q19 ie before COVID and related central bank actions. We define excess deposit growth as the change in deposits of 840b vs. a combined 244b increase in loans securities. Recall that mgmt has previously acknowledged that some of the deposit growth over this period is noncoreless sticky as system liquidity is reduced over timerates rise.
4222,79,200b of liquidity deployment can add nearly 20 to EPS with rates at 3
4223,79,"Deutsche Bank does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports.

Investors should consider this report as only a single factor in making their investment decision. DISCLOSURES AND ANALYST CERTIFICATIONS ARE LOCATED IN APPENDIX 1. MCI P 051042021."
4224,79,"It all depends on the level of rates and whether JPM would deploy the full 200b. But assuming they would, we can run some earnings sensitivities shown below."
4225,79,"If 10 year Treasuries hit 2 and JPM were to deploy the full 200b into 30 year agency backed RMBS pass throughs what big banks typically buy, this would boost net income by 11."
4226,79,"Each 100bp rise in base rates would increase this 5... RMBS spreads remain around current levels of 50bps and JPM deploys the full 200b. These are a lot of ifs, but this helps illustrate the potential earnings upside from deploying excess liquidity. As noted in the prior section, the earnings leverage outlined just above from deploying excess liquidity is in addition to the rate leverage disclosed in JPMs 10Q. Recall that as of 630, a 100bp rise in rates would boost JPMs 2022 net income by 15."
4227,79,"Other tidbits from the call Mgmt noted expenses would increase in 2022 vs. 2021, even though capital markets related revenue and related comp would likely be lower. This is higher than the flattish costs assumed in consensus for 2022 prior to today, but also not a huge surprise given expense pressure at JPM and across the banking industry. On the call, JPM noted the likely higher costs in 2022 reflected continued inflationary pressures and investment spend. We previously assumed flat costs and now assume a 12 rise."
4228,79,"Mgmt acknowledged that FY22 net II guidance implied a 300mplus increase in 4Q21 vs. 3Q. However, JPM cautioned not to run rate the implied 13.5b given seasonal boosts from marketstrading and one time benefits from PPP. Looking out to 1Q, theres also day count adjustments to make. This caused some market concern that consensus FY22 net II expectations of 55.1b may be too high. However, wed point out that mgmt was also upbeat about card growth in 2022 and as discussed above has already started to deploy some liquidity into securities."
4229,79,"Accounting for all this, our 1Q22 net II estimate is 13.1b and our FY22 estimate is 55.8b."
4230,79,"Card fees In the Consumer Bank, card fees were 651m in 3Q vs. 1.2b in 2Q. Mgmt noted on the call that the sequential decline was primarily due to higher marketingacquisition costs and due to a 180m adjustment to rewards liabilities. The adjustment is considered a one time event while marketing costs are expected to continue and be slightly higher in 4Q."
4231,79,"On loan growth, mgmt noted it has seen some recovery across lending products including the following For card, mgmt noted faster spend down of excess deposits for customers who are generally inclined to revolve and believe card outstandings should grow in 2022."
4232,79,"In home lending, mgmt expects portfolio additions to outpace prepayments in 4Q similar to 3Q trends."
4233,79,"For CI, mgmt noted that utilization rates had a little bit of an uptick among smaller corporates."
4234,79,"In CRE, mgmt noted robust origination pipelines and have removed any pandemicrelated pullbacks in credit and expect to see a little bit of net loan growth going forward."
4235,79,Mgmt also noted expected loan growth in markets but noted its
4236,79,"FICC trading In the earnings materials, it was noted that the current qtr included an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio. Mgmt noted that while FICC declined 20 yoy on a reported basis, ex the adjustment, FICC declined 15. This implies about 235m."
4237,79,"Mgmt noted 4Q IB fees would be up yoy, but likely lower than the robust 3Q level."
4238,79,Quick recap of 3Q results below and see full note from earlier today What Mattered Most in 3Q21 Results
4239,79,"EPS of 3.74 vs. consensus of 2.96. It was a strong quarter overall. The biggest drivers of the EPS beat were a large loan loss reserve release and lower than expected chargeoffs and a tax credit. However, even ex these items, results were better than expectedwith net interest income, fees and costs all better."
4240,79,Net interest income upside was driven by slightly better loans with 4Q to benefit from modest deployment of cash into securities later in the qtr.
4241,79,"Outside of net II, EQ trading, IB fees, and asset mgmt revenues were all better than DBe."
4242,80,"The CocaCola Company KO, Overweightrated is scheduled to report 4Q21 earnings on Thursday, February 10 , before the open. We have adjusted our margins assumptions and our 4Q21 EPS estimate of 0.41 moves up a penny and is inline with the current Bloomberg consensus. We think KO is set up for a strong quarter as ourconsensus estimates contemplate only a modest acceleration from 3Q in the twoyear CAGR on unit case volume and pricemix despite all indications that the operating environment was likely supportive sequentially e.g., October started strong, 3Q Delta variant impact, full benefit of offcycle price increase, positive US scanner data trends. From a margin perspective, we are more conservative vs. consensus on gross margin as six fewer days in the quarter and convergence of shipmentsunit cases drives deleverage in addition to headwind from incorporation of BODYARMOR closed 111, finished product all co manufactured and faster finished good sales, although our SGA estimates are modestly below the Street. Looking ahead to 2022, management tone around the underlying momentum has been positive were confident that were going to come out of COVID with a model that can drive the revenue at the topend of the model and our expectation for another abovealgorithm year in 2023 modeling 7.0 doesnt feel aggressive as it implies a 3year unit case volume and pricemix CAGR of just 1.1 and 2.4 vs. preCOVID 2year CAGR 2.1 and 3.3, respectively, despite the accelerated pricingRGM and marketinginnovation efforts bearing fruit. Management may choose to stick with its longterm algorithm when it initially guides 2022 given the COVID19 variants, but we think investors appreciate the strong brand equity ability to take pricing and favorable setup and would welcome a raise through the year as visibility increases, which should further help the stock narrative, although FX headwinds could limit USD EPS flow through. Despite KOs recent rally shares 9.5 vs. XLP 3.6 since December 13 see ournote, valuation is still at a 1x PE discount toOWratedPEP, which we expect to narrow we actually like both stocks and believe they are not mutually exclusive. Our Dec22 target price moves up 1 to 64 based on 24x our 2023 EPS inline with 2year average."
4243,80,"Framing TopLine Expectations for 2022. Management has sounded confident on the underlying topline momentum given recent organizational changes, investments behind innovation, and marketing optimization and as noted above management believes it can drive the topend of 46 organic revenue algorithm. We are anticipating another abovealgorithm year in 2022 given stillrecovering volumes from COVIDimpacted 2021 1H21 volumes remained below 2019 levels and continuation of strongerthanhistorical pricemix given pricingRGM focus to offset cost pressures. Allin, we are currently modeling 7.0 organic revenue growth with unit case volumes 3.0 and pricemix 4.0, although we think there could be further upside tension with further normalization of the operating environment."
4244,80,"Margin Expectations for 2022. Despite its more assetlite model, KO still faces impacts from the inflationary costsupply chain environment and FX, and with its 3Q earnings guided to a midsingledigits headwind to COGS for 2022 i.e., higher than midsingle digits inflation for commodities as the company rolls into higher cost hedges in 2022. We think its possible that the cost environment has gotten incrementally more challenging for at least some of KOs cost exposures, particularly for juice, which is The CocaCola Companys largest direct commodity exposure orange juice concentrate prices have surged 30 since KOs 3Q21 earnings call. Price increases and accelerating RGM initiatives should help to offset some of the inflationary impacts, although we see other headwinds including acquisition of BODYARMOR and faster growth of finished goods carries lower gross margin. From a GA perspective, we expect the company to be able to drive some leverage overall as the company further optimizes marketing spending. Netnet, we are modeling for gross margin compression of 39 bps in 2022 and operating margin contraction of 6 bps"
4245,80,"Updated FX Outlook . During the companys 3Q21 earnings call on October 27, 2021, management reiterates its fullyear 2021 currency outlook including a 12 benefit to the topline and 23 benefit to EPS and introduced expectations for 4Q21 including flat impact from FX on the topline and a 2 tailwind to EPS. The company also provided an initial 2022 currency outlook of a 2 to 3 headwind to both the top line and EPS. Since the 3Q21 earnings call, the USD has further strengthened according to our currency model by an average of about 80 bps between 4Q213Q22. For 4Q21, given hedging in place for G10 currencies we think its likely that KO could remain close to its approximately even impact guidance on the topline, and while we would assume that the currency impact implied by our model would fall within KOs initial 2022 guidance at this point to the topline, we do think it could be toward the lowerend, and could be below the lowend on EPS given historical multiplier of 1.2 1.5x currency impact from topline to bottomline. For the quarter, we forecasting a 0.5 impact to the topline inline with consensus and for 2022 we are forecasting an FX headwind of 2.7 vs. consensus 2.2."
4246,80,"4Q21 Expectations. We are expecting another quarter of doubledigits organic revenue growth on unit case basis as we expect a modest acceleration in the twoyear volume and pricemix CAGR given further recovery in awayfromhome performance through the quarter vs. 3Q and also higher pricemix given additional pricing actions and further progress on RGM initiatives. We are forecasting 4Q21 organic revenue growth of 12.8 unit case volume 6.2, pricemix 6.6 versus the applesto apples Consensus Metrix forecast of 13.0 unit case volumes 6.4 and pricemix 6.6. Using concentrate shipments consensus is currently modeling for 3.9 organic growth shipments 2.7, pricemix 6.6 and on an applestoapples basis our model also calls for organic growth of 3.9 shipments 2.6, pricemix 6.6. On gross margins, we are below the Street as we see tailwinds from pricing and away fromhome recovery being offset by the fewer shipping days in 4Q six fewer, which drives deleverage, and headwind to gross margins from full acquisition of BODYAMOR, which closed on November 1 finished product model typically carries lower margins. We are forecasting 4Q21 EPS of 0.41, which is inline with the current Bloomberg consensus estimate and up a penny from our prior estimate."
4247,80,"KOprovided some broad strokes around its initial outlook for 2022 with its 3Q earnings on October 27th, most directly around the costcurrency environment anticipating MSD COGS inflation and 2 to 3 toplineEPS impact from FX and more indirectly around the topline, as we recall below. That said, a lot has obviously changed since then, and we provide our view on where KO will likely land on its initial 2022 guidance below."
4248,80,"Management has sounded confident on the underlying topline momentumgiven recent organizational changes emerging stronger, investments behind innovation, and marketing optimization doing more with the sameand CEO Quincey noted at a recent conference that were confident that were going to come out of COVID with a model that can drive the revenue at the topend of the model, which calls for organic revenue of 46. We and current consensus per Consensus Metrix are anticipating another above algorithm year in 2022given stillrecovering volumes from COVIDimpacted 2021 1H21 volumes remained below 2019 levels and continuation of strongerthanhistorical pricemix given pricingRGM focus to offset cost pressures management commentary has been supportive with CEO Quincey noting"
4249,80,"and benefit from further recovery runway for the higher price per ounce awayfromhome channel we believe that KO has likely regained 70 of lost awayfromhome volumes thus far. From a guidance perspective, KO may take an initially conservative approach and not stray from its 46 algorithm but point to the higherend, although we see clear upside past the highend and believe KO would prefer to raise through the year as visibility increases following some potential early year disruption from the Omicron wave ."
4250,80,"Allin,we are currently modeling 7.0 organic revenue growth with unit case volumes 3.0 and pricemix 4.0 vs. current Consensus Metrix of 7.2 shipment volumes 3.0 and pricemix 4.7. There could be upside tension to our numbers as our volume estimates contemplate a continuing gradual acceleration in the CAGR with stronger 2H vs. 1H though on yearyear basis we model for a stronger 1H given the compares but supposes2022 volumes land about 3.4 above 2019 levels or a 3year CAGR of about 1.1 preCOVID 20182019 2year unit case volume CAGR was 2.1 since CEO Quinceytook overand our pricemix estimates imply a 3year CAGR of 2.4 preCOVID 20182019 2year pricemix CAGR 3.3, which seems somewhat conservative given the pricingRGM actions likely higher and more widespread than historical,likely continued lower promotional environment given inflation and supply chain pressures, and FX pressures.Looking beyond organic growth, on FX, as we detail below, KO provided initial guidance for currency to be a 2 to 3 headwind to the topline based on spot rates in late October and hedged positions and since then the USD has appreciated further, so currency headwinds could be toward the lowerend of the range, and on MA we are estimating that the acquisition of BODYARMOR will add about 2.5 to the topline.In the table below, we outline our 2021 forecasts vs. consensus."
4251,80,"KO is lapping a 6 organic revenue decline in the yearago period on unit case volume basis, on concentrate volume basis a more modest 3 decline, the same as in 3Q20, and like 3Q21 we are expecting another quarter of doubledigits organic revenue growth on unit case basis as we expect a modest acceleration in the twoyear volume and pricemix CAGR as we broadly expect further recovery in awayfromhome performance through the quarter vs. 3Q 3Q was impacted by Delta variant and also higher pricemix given additional pricing actions and further progress on RGM initiatives. While Omicron began surging late in 4Q, we think the impact was likely relatively limited in the quarter, although looking ahead to 1Q22 impacts tothe supply chain could have been more material e.g., sick employees, softer onpremise."
4252,80,"3Q21 volumes landed ahead of 2019 levels despite a softer August period impacted by Delta variantas well ongoing lockdownsstate of emergency in several markets inAsia Pacificmarkets e.g., China, Japan, and poor weather in Europe. However trends improved sequentially in September and momentum heading into 4Q sounded solid with management describing October results started strong and inline with expectations so we feel comfortable modeling for some modest improvement in the twoyear CAGR. From an organic growth perspective, the calendar 4Q has six fewer shipping days relative to the prior year which had two extra days, which will impact the concentrate shipment volumes and result in a convergence of concentrate shipments to unit case volumes year to3Q21 concentrate shipments 13 vs. unit case volume 8, which had been running ahead due to five extra calendar days in 1Q21 and inventory build by bottlers to mitigate anticipates supply chain pressures."
4253,80,"From a pricemix perspective, underlying our expectations for a slight acceleration in the twoyear trend is further pricing actions, which should be felt more fully in 4Q e.g., off cycle price increase of HSD in US put through in August, as well as further benefits from RGM initiatives to offset supply chain inflationary pressures incidence pricing from bottlers that are feeling pressures more. Sequentially there should be acceleration in pricemix as well as reopening has positive pricemix implications given higher price per ounce given immediate consumption as well as higher finished good sales recall, during 4Q20 there were incremental restrictions in the US as well as other International markets."
4254,80,"Weare forecasting 4Q21 organic revenue growth of 12.8 unit case volume 6.2, pricemix 6.6 versus the applestoapples Consensus Metrix forecast of 13.0 unit case volumes 6.4 and pricemix 6.6. Consensus and the company utilize concentrate shipments to derive organic growth and on that basis the consensus is currently modeling for 3.9 organic growth shipments 2.7, pricemix 6.6 and on an applestoapples basis our model also calls for organic growth of 3.9 shipments 2.6, pricemix6.6.On a regional basis, our organic sales forecasts are as follows 14.0 in EMEA unit case volume 7.0, pricemix 7.0, 26.0 in Latin America unit case volume 6.0, pricemix 20.0, 11.5 in North America unit case volume 6.0, pricemix 5.5, 2.5 in Asia Pacific unit case volume 4.0, pricemix 1.5, 34.0 in Global Ventures unit case volume 14.0, pricemix 20.0, and 2.0 in BIG unit case volume 2.0, pricemix flat."

Since the 3Q21 earnings call, the USD has further strengthened according to our currency model by an average of about 80 bps between 4Q213Q22. For 4Q21, given hedging in place for G10 currencies we think its likely that KO could remain close to its approximately even impact guidance on the topline, and while we would assume that the currency impact implied by our model would fall within KOs initial 2022 guidance at this pointto the topline, we do think it could be toward the lowerend, and could be below the lowend on EPS given historical multiplier of 1.21.5x currency impact from topline to bottom line. For the quarter, we are now forecasting a 0.5 impact to the topline vs. prior flat, inline with the current Consensus Metrix consensus of 0.5. Looking ahead to 2022, we are forecasting an FX headwind of 2.7, which is unchanged from our last published update on December 13, 2021, and is 50 bps below the current Consensus Metrix consensus of 2.2.

4259,81,"JPM is willing and able to spend what it takes to win in tech. Over the past 2 Leadership. decade, its discretionary tech spendingup 2x over the past 5 yearswould be enough to capitalize the fifthlargest US bank. To meet its frontend goals, JPM is now embracing the downstream requirements to modernize the backend."
4260,81,"Financially, JPM continues to pursue market share but, versus the past, is doing 3 Risks. so with negative operating leverage. Managerially, it is tough to monitor paybacks from tech investments. Operating risk gets amplified by the level of JPMs technical debt, complexity, and franchise breadth. Execution risk increases since JPM is pursuing so many initiatives at the same time."
4261,81,"JPM seems excited about its pursuit to become the first dominant 2.0 Digital Bank. Yet, this also carries risks. The picture below sums up our thoughtsdiving off a cliff into the water reflects that there is no turning back from a generational change in core banking systems. This is necessitated by the goal to provide Big Techtype, frontend customer experiences and services."
4262,81,"For most of the last decade, JPMs ability to change its Digital Banking 1.0 has been good for JPM. banking services from analog to digitalor relatively more to bots from bankershas aided JPMs improvement in both market share and efficiency. Tech at JPM has worked wellover the past seven years, JPM has shown strong, techenabled positive operating leverage, and relative stock price outperformance vs. the SPX and BKX up 2.8x vs. 2.3x and 2.0x."
4263,81,"JPMs new phase of its corporate life cycle is that it seeks to build a better Digital Banking 2.0 is now. mousetrap by providing new functionality in digital form that was previously unavailable, whereby the experience transcends traditional banking functions. The impetus is both the ability to do so new techand the necessity given the myriad of new competitors. We describe the difference between Digital Banking 1.0 and 2.0 as evolving from mere adoption, transactions, and replication to engagement, relationships, and innovation."
4264,81,". Our firms software analyst gives a framework in his Software analyst gives framework for analysis previously published workmoats, automation, and data MAD about softwarefor discussing software firms which can apply to JPM, as follows"
4265,81,"1. JPM has made it clear that it can spend whatever it takes, and believes it has the scale Moats. as the No.1 bank to do so. JPMs tech spending in 2022 alone equals the total expenses of the eighth largest bank and ranks among the top few of all industries. JPMs goal and potential is to provide superior, homegrown differentiated products, platforms, and experiences, with seamless multichannel delivery, transitioning from share of wallet to share of life experiences. One clear example of expansion far beyond traditional banking is its acquisition of restaurant guide Zagat."
4266,81,"2. . To meet JPMs customer targets, another key goal is to modernize its infrastructure Automation and further its scalability with more bots relative to bankers. Indeed, half of JPMs infrastructure spend is on the Cloud, and JPM targets 1.5B in automation and other productivity savings."
4267,81,"3. JPM also seeks to unlock the power of its data, which includes 500 petabytes of data Data. for context, the Library of Congress has under 25 petabytes of data. JPM expects that its few hundred use cases with AI should lead to 1B of benefits, and it expects to soon have a few thousand use cases. An overriding objective is for cybersecurity everywhere and all the time."
4268,81,"The key question is whether the pace of accelerating, record tech Risks with the new transformation investments is faster than its ability to effectively manage, similar to the past. Several risks abound as follows"
4269,81,"A key question is whether JPM is pursuing . It is Management risk too much at the same time pursuing the expansion of 14 techrelated deals and strategic investments over the past two years, launching a consumer bank outside the US for the first time the UK and Brazil are only a start, transitioning the core banking system to the Cloud, and even acting as a first mover to the Metaverse."
4270,81,"The decision of if and when to cut losses as it did with FINN or invest more as with US consumer digital banking can be a tough one. Indeed, in the opening remarks at JPMs May 2022 investor day, CEO Jamie Dimon said that tech success can be hard to measure at timeswhich means it is even harder for those of us on the outside to have visibility toward progress."
4271,81,"The strategic question is whether this is an effective grand plan that pieces together historical investment and other spending, with dozens of transactions to reinforce leadership for the next decade or, as relayed to us by investors, whether this is a new type of empire building built on top of past success but only to push too much."
4272,81,"First, the transition to new systems and esp. the Cloud half of JPMs infrastructure Operating risk spending has typically come with more costs, complexity and time than initially thought. Second, acquisitions have their own items, especially expansion of digital banking in the crowded UK market. Third, the level of technical debt is greater than previously realized."
4273,81,"To get to Digital Banking 2.0, JPM needs to have a more modernized back office and reduce its higher than previously known level of apps 6400 and data centers 37, which it intends and needs to do. These are necessary steps to achieve more realtime processing with greater amounts of data to better service customers. Indeed, JPM mentioned technical debt on its 4Q21 earnings call for the first time ever."
4274,81,"The adage better late than never applies since JPM has known about the strategic threat its 2014 annual report proclaimed that Silicon Valley is Coming and is now taking more forceful actions, given Big Tech knocking at the door and sometimes getting in."
4275,81,"Whats new is the degree that JPM is willing to sacrifice returns in order to gain Financial risk share, given the highest increase in tech spending and total expenses in the companys history. JPMs record 14B of tech spending raises the question whether any bank can spend this amount of money wisely, esp. given a discretionary portion 7B that is more than 2x above the 23B level from ."
4276,81,"This leads to certain, frontloading of expenses for less certain back end benefits. We forecast the worst three years of operating leverage in the firms modern history . Indeed, inflation has already increased the amount of discretionary investments post 2Q22 results."
4277,81,"Much depends on the effectiveness of overseers to ensure financial discipline, though there have been changes in the role of CFO for the firm and in three of the four business lines. In addition, the high level of tech spending is part necessity given JPMs level of technical debt and complexity that comes with its expansive business and geographic mix."
4278,81,"Having rejected the pursuit of the Cloud a few years ago, we suspect that JPM may Cloud risk be only middle of the pack in its pursuit to embrace the Cloud despite its more aggressive stance today. In some ways, JPM looks like others, since all large US banks have a hybrid, multiple Cloud approach JPM uses AWS, Google, and Microsoft, with seemingly more activities on the frontend than the backend."
4279,81,"We suspect that JPM is in the industrytrend ballpark for doubling Cloud workloads to 15 YoY. This is based on a survey by Accenture of 150 global banks. Yet, unlike some others, JPM seems unable to shoot for zero ops no data systems given its status as a systemically critical firm."
4280,81,"Embracing core banking conversion. Only 7 of banks have converted their core banking platform to the cloud Accenture. This makes JPMs decision to do so an industryshaking one, implying the transition of decades old code off clunky mainframes to a new platform."

4287,81,Past successJPM had used tech to improve share and efficiency over most of last Governance decade a new risk is the greater willingness to accept negative operating leverage for market share
4288,81,Below we summarize the risks to JPMorgan tech efforts in our AG format
4289,81,"Greater use of thirdparty vendors can be like dealing with arms dealers, which sell to JPM AI as well as its competitors. In other words, JPMs innovationleading approach to tech might get diluted. Moreover, another risk is the shorter life cycle of tech, meaning the need for new investments i.e., that is one advantage of being a close follower. Lastly, the CIO said evidence of success is to track the firms business results."
4290,81,"Scrubbing data into a more useable format may take years to execute, esp. for a firm with Big data 500 petabytes of data and legacy infrastructrure. Over 5 years, tech investment spend has about doubled 3B in 2017 to 7B in est. 2022 and increased from 13 to 12 of the tech budget. This"
4291,81,"pace of increase can lead to wasteful spending. Indeed, sometimes tech is the wrong tool for the jobthe industry applies tech solutions for a process that is flawed est. 15th of the time."
4292,81,"JPMs core banking system conversion comprises half of infrastructure investments, and Cloud the track record is that it costs more, takes longer, and is more complex than expected based on observations at other firms taking a similar approach. Despite the somewhat late start toward the cloud in general, JPMs hybrid approach is on the path toward public cloud optimization. Yet, moving 100 of its consumer core platform to Thought Machine incl. 50 of its data to the public cloud by yearend 2023 comes with operational and reputational risks."
4293,81,"Even though 61 mil. active digital customers the largest and top 1 or 2 in almost Digital banking all digital banking categories, neobanks have est. 1 in 4 global consumer customers and lower cost of entry vs. the past."
4294,81,"JPM is still in the early innings in our view of aligning this higher PE, lower Electronic payments capitalintensive activities across its LOBs."
4295,81,"Doubled computestorage volumes with only modest growth in infrastructure Faster processing costs 2 CAGR , yet it still has significant technical debt as reflected by 6400 apps and 33 data centers. For example, State Street is a cautionary tale its tech transformation this decade led to a worse pretax margin due to complexity, cost, difficulty, and time per its boards lead director. Many JPM efforts probably have no payback, though some have an ROI of 2x, and recent investor day presentations noted five or so year payback periods consumer, nonUS consumer."
4296,81,"First, digitization creates new risks, and JPMs cyber spend seems defensive to Governance protect against what might be the No.1 risk to banking. While JPM and other large banks seem to have greater resilience, they are more exposed given a larger attack surface. Second, JPM had used tech to improve share and efficiency over most of last decade, but the new risk is the greater willingness to accept negative operating leverage for market share. There are 4 CIOs for JPMs 4 business lines, and then there is also the firms CIO who oversees tech for the entire firm. While there are synergies by business line, the ability to coordinate activities across business lines does not seem easy."
4297,81,"Investment Thesis JPMorgan Chase rated Equal Weight has excelled at both offense and defense over the past decade in which it has been gaining market share in all major business lines while optimizing its businesses, showing consistent earnings relative to other global banks, and creating a fortress balance sheet as defined by its CEO. Playing defense has carried more importance over the past few years however, greater offense is expected to play a role as JPM continues to invest long term. This issue is certain to us frontloaded spending in the near term for less certain backended benefits. JPM continues to reflect our Goliath is Winning theme, but the cost and time frame for doing so are greater and longer than expected. Moreover, JPM is more expensive than the average bank at a time when other banks are more pure plays on our 2022 theme NII to the Sky. Target Price Valuation for JPM 118.00 from NC We arrive at a price target of 118, which implies 9.8x our 2023E EPS and 1.6x pricetotangible book value, based on the simple average of six valuation techniques PE, pricetobook, discount dividend model, PEG ratio analysis and sum of the parts for both PE and PB. The 20year forward PE for JPM has averaged 14x, and the median was 12x PTB avg. 1.8x over the past decade. Risks to Our Price Target and Rating for JPM Macro downside risk factors include a slowdown in global economic activity, greaterthanexpected increases in unemployment and bankruptcies in the US and abroad, and adverse changes in US and foreign laws and regulations. Companyspecific downside risks include higherthanprojected credit losses especially in credit cards and home equity but also other consumer areas and commercial lending, market and interestrate risks which can affect JPMorgans businesses and portfolios in a variety of ways, especially MSRs and investment securities, and operational risks primarily associated with regulatory compliance across the firms domestic consumer and global wholesale businesses. Risks to the upside include higher rates with a steeper yield helps traditional banking revenue, with no commensurate negative impact on capital markets activities advisory, underwriting, trading and a stronger than expected recovery resulting in strongerthanexpected loan growth."

Ciena Announces that 82.5 2018 Converts were Tendered CIEN Positive Ciena announced the final results of its offer to exchange its currently outstanding 3.75 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 for a new series of 3.75 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 and an exchange fee of 2.50 per 1,000 original principal amount, to provide Ciena with cash settlement options upon any conversion election by the holders. The exchange offer expired on Friday. An aggregate principal amount of 288.7m at maturity of the old notes, representing 82.5 of the old Notes, were validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn. Ciena Our View In the prospectus filed on Friday 728, the company mentioned that it has not made a determination that it will use the treasury stock method to account for these modified converts. However, we note that if the company decides to use the Treasury method it will help reduce dilution from the converts and boost estimated EPS looking forward by around 6 for the consensus on our calcs. In our opinion, this is a shareholder friendly move on Cienas part that shows not only confidence in their business but also a willingness to return cash to shareholders.

Bottlers are taking balanced Q2 commentary suggests pricemix still a lever ahead approaches, as the global Coke System leverages the many tools at its disposal to confront inflation not just price increases, but mixRGM too. But, as with recent quarters, it seems obvious to us that the price trend is higher, namely with elasticity holding up. We lay out bottler quotes in Exhibit 6 from Arca Continental, CocaCola FEMSA, CocaCola Consolidated, CCEP, CocaCola Icecek, and CocaCola HBC."

Global scanner trends are 11.2 for Q3, so estimates seem reasonable, with upside. For 2022, we model organic sales 12.9 volume 3.7, pricemix 9.2 vs Street 13.2 volume 5.3, pricemix 7.9. We continue to think Street models have lagged the pricemix glide path. This is especially acute in 2023 where we model pricemix 7.2 vs Street 3.5."
4454,87,"Over the last decade KO has implemented incidencebased pricing agreements with its bottlers, with KO and its bottlers now aligned behind growing the top line. As such, KOs sales growth is now directly related to its bottlers sales growth. Pricing is one tool bottlers use to grow sales, but is playing a bigger part in FY22 as bottlers raise prices to offset inflation."

Pricing is a component of the strategy in addition to productivity, promotion optimization and other revenue growth management tools like mix and packaging. Strong marketing support from KO provides a tailwind behind the brands, making it easier for bottlers to take pricing."
4462,87,"In 2021 and into 2022, there has been little negative impact from pricing, with volume elasticity tracking much lower than historical levels and competitors also pricing as well. Several bottlers are implementing incremental price increases in 2H22, including Arca Continental U.S., Mexico, Coca Cola Consolidated U.S., CCEP all markets, and CocaCola Bottlers Japan."
4463,87,"Commentary indicates We compiled quotes from the Q222 earnings calls for key bottlers below. that strong pricemix for bottlers is likely to continue through 2022 and into 2023 a carryover from recently enacted pricing actions, plus incremental pricing in 2H, which should also be a tailwind for KO."

On its Q222 call management confirmed it was also raising prices on small PET products in October, a much larger part of its portfolio almost 23 of sales."
4466,87,"This is notable as Japan is historically a deflationary market. The large PET pricing recently enacted is only the second price increase in the last 30 years, and it will be the first time in 30 years that CCBJ will be raising pricing on small PET products in October. Coca Cola products in Japan already sell at a premium and the bottler is leading the industry with price increases."
4467,87,"This will be a key market to watch in the coming quarters for indications of consumer price elasticity sensitivity. So far large PET volumes have recovered at a faster pace than the 2019 price increases.

We view the dividend as manageable with additional capital deployment potential ahead. Buy the recovery, in our view. Overweight KO. Target Price Valuation for KO 66.00 from NC Our 66 price target is based on a 26x PE multiple to our CY23E EPS estimatethe higher end of KOs historical PE range, reflecting defensive qualities in a volatile macro backdrop, underlying momentum in the business, and a favorable cost structure assetlight amid inflation.

Indeed, there was zero assurance that this historic increase in expenses will level o after this year. Moreover, Robert Rutschow we believe JPM is more expensive than the average bank at a time when other banks are more pure plays on our 2022 theme, NII to the Sky. We continue to favor the banks featured in our new report, 2022 Outlook Stay Aboard the Bank Train. Eric Chan To us, JPM is spending the benets of rate increases, which Expenses are the issue. should keep its ROTCE below its target of 17 for the next few years. JPM guides for 8 higher expenses in 2022 due to inationcompTE normalization 40 and deliberate increases in investments 60, implying a second year in a row of negative operating leverage. While JPM indicated that it intended to gain market share in each business, it gave few other concrete metrics around future expectations even though investments targeted 15bn in 2022 are set to increase by 30 YoY and by 57 since 2019."
4471,89,"The degree of downside Big reduction to estimates given companyspecic moves. to our estimates is a surprise to us after reviewing our earnings model. We est. ROTCE declining to 15 and not getting to 17 over the next 3 years due to higher expenses, lower fee revenue in CIB and Consumer, and less buybacks thats even while the company should show the best NII growth in its history guided 12 higher core in 2022. The decline in our PT follows our est. revision downward."
4472,89,"We dont see how the math works otherwise with the increase in expenses this year, especially since JPM gave no assurance that expenses would not continue to increase after 2022. Specically, JPM is projecting expenses to increase 6bn while core NII is projected to increase 5bn and the company is coming o record revenue in CIB. Netnet, we est. 2022E revenue to be up 1 while expenses are up 8 core. As a result, we lower our estimates for 2022 to 11.25 from 12.65, 2023 to 12.30 from 14.35, 2024 to 14.00 from 16.25, and 2025 to 15.50 from 18.05."
4473,89,"Good longterm company, but perhaps too long of a horizon for bank stock investors, especially without more detail. This is not to say the wheels are coming o. On the contrary, JPM continues to gain market share along with progress, like the industry, in NII, loans, and mergers. Indeed, a midteens ROTCE is still decent. Nonetheless, at a time when most banks should show improving pretax prot margins, JPM is likely to go in the opposite direction over the next 12 years. In the end, we feel that the burden is on JPM to give more specics about its expected benets since they are incurring certain expenses for uncertain benets."
4474,89,"Investment Thesis JPMorgan Chase rated Equal Weight has excelled at both oense and defense over the past decade in which it has been gaining market share in all major business lines while optimizing its businesses, showing consistent earnings relative to other global banks and creating a fortress balance sheet as dened by its CEO.

4475,89,Upcoming Catalysts JPM is not holding an investor day this year the same as 2021 resulting in less interaction with the company and management than in preCOVID years. Upcoming companyspecic events include its 10K release in February incl. updated interest rate sensitivity information and 1Q22 results in April.

This includes 4 billion to repurchase 31.2 million shares in open market transactions in the June quarter, and 90 billion in total share repurchases since the start of the capital return program. While the market is starting to express concerns over Apples dependency on the iPhone, and growth in the China market, we mention two other items."
4484,90,"1 Services. Apple makes wonderful hardware and has nicely integrated it with a software operating system. Its other software products and services layer can be considered merely adequate, in our opinion. Does anyone really love using iTunes? Do you truly consider the App store a polished product with curated suggestions that cant be improved? Have you compared Siri to Google Now? Music may have millions of customers take the free trial, but given the resources that Apple has isnt it a bit disappointing to have a product that is similar to others already on the market? Given the excitement over a potential TV bundle, should we expect a break out product given the recent launches? Why cant Apple build up an advertising revenue stream? And finally, and what point does owning the platform increase the regulatory risk to the company as it uses pricing power and the App store to its own advantage? 2 Growth. We are modeling growth on a yearoveryear basis to slow starting in the December quarter of 2016. We are not factoring in revenue from new products that are not announced such as TV, but we are factoring in an iPhone and iPad refresh. While we respect that 73 of the installed base has not upgraded to a 66, and this is going to be driver, the yearly comparison becomes increasingly difficult starting in the December quarter. We do not see that Apple has much room left to increase the ASP of the iPhone, increasing its dependence on growth by driving more units through the channel. Finally, the capital return program has completed 126 billion of the 200 billion plan, and share repurchase activity is slowing as the company spends its domestic cash."

4680,92,"Earlier today, 7.5 months into her new role, JPM hosted a holiday gettogether and QA session with CFO"
4681,92,"Jenn Piepszak for sellside analysts. In addition, Piepszak gave her first investor conference presentation"
4682,92,earlier this week. Following we recap our key takeaways from these two events.
4683,92,"Recall, Piepszak became CFO and a member of JPMs Operating Committee on May 1. She is responsible for a"
4684,92,Office. Piepszak began her career at JPM in 1994 in the Corporate Investment Bank where she held various controller
4685,92,"businesses. She moved to Consumer Community Banking in 2009, where she was CFO of Mortgage Banking and"
4686,92,Controller of Mortgage Banking and Retail Financial Services. She became Business Banking CEO in Jan 2015 and in Feb
4687,92,2017 was named CEO of its Card Services business. We view Piepszak as another example of JPM moving around strong
4688,92,4Q19 update JPM expects 4Q19 trading revenues to rise meaningfully yoy with increases in both FICC and equities
4689,92,though FICC should outperform equities. It expects investment banking fees to be stable yoy implies down 8 from
4690,92,"3Q19. This is better than its prior guidance of down yoy. The quarter has played out a little bit better than it thought,"
4691,92,largely on healthy investmentgrade activity given the rate environment. It also believes it is taking market share. With
4692,92,"respect to net interest income, it noted the interest rate environment has gotten a little bit better, thus results could be"
4693,92,"closer to 14.2bn in 4Q19. Recall, it had guided to less than 57.5bn on its 3Q19 earning call. YTD, on a managed basis,"
4694,92,"it has reported 43.5bn. As such, 57.5bn for the fullyear would have implied 14.0bn for 4Q19, while 14.2bn equates"
4695,92,to 57.7bn. This 0.2bn pickup equals 0.05shr all else equal.
4696,92,Operating environment JPM sees continued global GDP growth with the Fed and ECB on hold as we head into 2020.
4697,92,"Its believes the consumer is incredibly strong, and credit is very, very good amid a very strong labor market and a"
4698,92,"rebound in consumer sentiment. Based on its own data, it noted holiday spend feels consistent the trends it has been"
4699,92,"seeing all year, which is up about 10 yoy. Of note, looking at Black Friday through Cyber Monday, spend was up"
4700,92,"closer to 20 yoy. On the business side, it noted there are some cautionary signs. Still, at the margin, it has seen"
4701,92,Business opportunities JPM sees opportunities across the franchise for growth and is focused on building on its scale
4702,92,Consumer Community Banking CCB. Its Consumer Business Bank should benefit from its market
4703,92,"expansion strategy. It expects to have 8090 branches open its expansion markets of Boston, Philly, North"
4704,92,"Carolina, Virginia, and Minneapolis by yearend. While early days, it noted it is exceeding its expectations versus"
4705,92,"historical performance for new branches in totality, some branches ahead while other are behind. In Credit"
4706,92,"Card, the secular tailwind of the electronification of cash should contribute to growth, although it believes there is"
4707,92,"an opportunity to take market share. In addition, it has 40mn credit card households and a little less than one"
4708,92,third of them have a multiLOB relationship with it. Mortgage has also proven to be an effective role for it to
4709,92,deepen relationships. It said it is seeing a meaningful portion of its deposit growth in the consumer bank coming
4710,92,"from customers who were previously consumer lending only customers. Interestingly, it is having aboveaverage"
4711,92,success with its Chase Ink Business Card customers opening personal retail accounts as they are already familiar
4712,92,with the brand. JPM also recently launched two new products called My Chase Plan and My Chase Loan. My
4713,92,"Chase Plan is point of scale financing for example TV, refrigerator, built off its credit card app, while My Chase"
4714,92,Loan allows one to borrow against their unused available credit limit for example kitchen remodel. Its a
4715,92,targeted product feature for existing customers with no application or credit check needed. It believes this
4716,92,should allow it to compete better against competitors unsecured consumer credit offerings.
4717,92,"Corporate Investment Bank CIB In CIB, it continues to build scale in wholesale payments. It sees China"
4718,92,as a big opportunity. It is also surgically hiring in markets where its relatively underpenetrated around the
4719,92,world. It believes it is continuing to take market share in investment banking.
4720,92,Commercial Bank CB CIB is focused on international expansion and building on the existing infrastructure
4721,92,"that it has in the Investment Bank. Still, it noted last year 40 of its IB fees in North America came from the"
4722,92,"Asset Wealth Management AWM In AWM, international private banking is an opportunity as high net"
4723,92,worth is a segment where it is relatively underpenetrated. It also recently announced it is combing its U.S.
4724,92,its new You lnvest online brokerage under common leadership as it aims to better penetrate the highnetwork
4725,92,"Loans Excluding home lending loan sales, loans should grow in the 34 range in 2019. Assuming the environment"
4726,92,"holds, 2020 should be in a similar range. It expects strong growth rates in credit card 8 yoy in 3Q19 and AWM"
4727,92,"7 to continue into next year. In CB, trends appear mixed. It is seeing good growth in CI in specialized industries"
4728,92,"and expansion markets. Still, this is being mitigated by continued runoff of its taxexempt portfolio. And in CRE, good"
4729,92,"origination activity in commercial term lending, given the rate environment, is offset by real estate banking as it is being"
4730,92,"cautious. And, CIB loan growth is expected to remain episodic."
4731,92,"Deposits It views deposit betas as largely symmetric. On the retail side, it didnt see a lot of reprice on the way up, so"
4732,92,"it expects less of an opportunity on the way down. In fact, it noted in 3Q19 and 4Q19, its rate paid on retail deposits has"
4733,92,"increased due to mix shift, as customers are still moving from savings to CDs. Still, it did note CD pricing has come off its"
4734,92,"peak. On the wholesale side, it did see deposits costs start to come down after the 1st rate cut late July and witnessed"
4735,92,an acceleration after the 2nd rate cut midSept and expects a further reduction Fed cut again in late Oct before holding
4736,92,in midDec. These reductions have been more prevalent in CIB than CB and AWM. After a slowdown in deposit growth
4737,92,"earlier in the year, when it chose not to compete as aggressively on price, it has witnessed improvement post the recent"
4738,92,Fed cuts. It would expect this improved level of growth to continue into 2020.
4739,92,"Expenses It continues to feel like 55, a level it achieved in 3Q19, is a proper efficiency ratio target. Still, it continues"
4740,92,"to see opportunities for further efficiencies. It cited robotics and the opportunity to replace repetitive processes,"
4741,92,"technology. It also noted tellertransactions are down 40, while 80 of its transactions are now through selfservice"
4742,92,channels. JPM has also increased its technology budget significantly over the last few years 11.5bn slated for 2019
4743,92,"with half going to investment spend. Still, given its been investing a portion in productivity, it has opportunities to self"
4744,92,fund incremental investments. It is also looking to better measure human capital productivity in an effort to improve
4745,92,"Asset quality It noted asset quality looks pretty pristine heading into 2020. Still, it is surgically pulling back in"
4746,92,"certain pockets. It noted certain cells in the consumer space look less attractive, while it is being cautious in CRE."
4747,92,"Capital Despite our calculation that it was in the 400bps GSIB surcharge bucket at 3Q19, JPM said it expects to be in"
4748,92,"the 350bp bucket at yearend which counts for measurement purposes. Still, looking out, it remains hopeful the Fed"
4749,92,"will refine this process. Its CET1 target remains the upperend of 1112, while it awaits the final SCB rule from the Fed."
4750,92,Acquisitions It would expect to continue to look acquire or partner in areas where it may have competitive gaps.
4751,92,Recent examples of this include the purchases of InstaMed health care payments and WePay small business payment

4913,93,"Amazon shares may continue a pattern of volatility on earnings results, as investors expect the company to report its most profitable June quarter in company history, although we still expect net income margins to be a mere 1.7. Shares have traded anywhere from 6 to 14 on earnings, with the stock trading up 4 of the last eight quarters."
4914,93,"We mention that if we take our 2017 revenue estimate of 158 billion, and generously apply a 10 margin, followed by a 25 tax rate also generous, and divide by the 487 million shares we estimate, this is 24.33 in EPS. Using a stock price of 735share, that EPS gives a 30x multiple for a company that is growing revenue 16 YoY . The point of this exercise is to show that even if the company was able to obtain a 10 overall margin profile, one could view that the valuation is already reflected at current share price levels."
4915,93,"Regarding AWS, our estimates are revenue of 2.7B with margin of 28, revenue growth of 50 YoY and 9 of total revenue. We see risks to growth slowing and profitability being reduced via a combination of competition, price cuts and overall service commoditization. If one were to assign the value of Walmart to Amazons retail operations, approximately 228B, that would leave 119B in value for Amazons remaining businesses, which are primarily AWS. While we respect the growth and margin profile of AWS, it is subject to commoditization risk and a valuation of over 100 billion at its current level seems more than reasonable. CEO Jeff Bezos is reported to have used the line Your profit is my opportunity, and we mention that AWS competition may seek to flip this around on Mr. Bezos by using price as a lever to win business."
4916,93,"We estimate revenue for the June quarter to be 29.2B, which is growth of 26 YoY and 0.2 sequentially. This compares to the consensus estimate of 29.6B. Our earnings per share estimate of 1.05 compares to 0.19 in the prior year and 1.07 in the prior quarter. Consensus is 1.11."
4917,93,"North America We expect revenue from the North America segment to be at 17.0B in the quarter for 58 of total, 24 YoY growth and segment operating income of 869M. We expect Media to grow in North America at 24 YoY for 19 of North American revenue and EGM electronics and other general merchandise revenue to grow at 23 YoY, accounting for 80 of North American revenue."
4918,93,"International We expect revenue from International segment to be 9.4B in the quarter with a growth of 24 YoY. We expect Media revenue to grow 21 YoY to provide 27 of total, and EGM to grow at 25 YoY providing 72 of International revenue. Company Data Media EGM We expect worldwide Media revenue to grow 23 YoY to 6B for 20 of total revenue. EGM revenue estimated at 20B, 24 YoY growth. This segment is the growth engine for the company and expected to account for 70 of total revenue."
