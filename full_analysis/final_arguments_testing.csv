Indeed, Mary noted that GM is looking for additional EV skateboard customers beyond the two recent companies that GM has inked deals with Nikola and Honda.

GM is likely reluctant to spin out its consumer-facing EV operations because in an all electric future, EVs will be the only vehicles in the showroom, and removing the ability of legacy Chevrolet to pivot to EVs would doom legacy Chevrolet to a dim future as in buggy whips. However, by sourcing skateboards from a quasi-independent skateboard company, GM could continue to shift its legacy brands to EVs. Moreover, if skeptics are right and consumers only want EVs from new companies without an internal combustion engine ICE history, GM shareholders would benefit from skateboard co sales to those OEMs or even at some point create its own consumer facing brand.","{'Market Position': 'positive', 'Long-term Growth': 'positive', 'Innovation': 'positive'}"
